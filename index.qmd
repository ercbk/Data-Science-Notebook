# Preface {.unnumbered}

These notes were transferred from Evernote to Quarto, so some of notes may be difficult to read as the editing of the note format is still an ongoing process.

Notes without numbers in sidebar should be a good indicator of a note that I've finished formatting.

Initially, I had no intent of publicly releasing these notes, so I haven't attributed all the authors of the content inside this notebook. If you see your work and want credit, please let me know and I'll do so.

Also, if you see any mistakes or have any questions, please open an issue at the github [repository](https://github.com/ercbk/Data-Science-Notebook).
