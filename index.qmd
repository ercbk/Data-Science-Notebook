# Preface  {.unnumbered}

These notes were transferred from Evernote to Quarto, so some of notes may be difficult to read as the editing of the note format is still an ongoing process.

Notes without numbers in sidebar should be a good indicator of a note that I've finished formatting.

If you see any mistakes or have any questions, please open an issue at the github [repository](https://github.com/ercbk/Data-Science-Notebook).
