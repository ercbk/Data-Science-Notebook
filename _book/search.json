Score your model on this new validation set\n\n“Train-Dev” is the sampled validation set\nPossibilities\n\nVariance: The data distribution of the training set is the same as the validation/test sets\n\n\nThe model has been overfit to the training data\n\nData Mismatch: The data distribution of the training set is NOT the same as the validation/test sets\n\n\nUnlucky and the split was bad\n\nSomething maybe is wrong with the splitting function\n\nSplit ratio needs adjusting. Validation set isn’t getting enough data to be representative.\n\n\n\n\nModel is performing well on the validation/test set but not in the real world\n\nInvestigate the validation/test set and figure out why it’s not reflecting real world data. Then, apply corrections to the dataset.\n\ne.g. distributions of your validation/tests sets should look like the real world data.\n\nChange the metric\n\nConsider weighting cases that your model is performing extremely poorly on.\n\n\nSplits\n\nHarrell: “not appropriate to split data into training and test sets unless n&gt;20,000 because of the luck (or bad luck) of the split.”\nIf your dataset is over 1M rows, then having a test set of 200K might be overkill (e.g. ratio of 60/20/20).\n\nMight be better to use a ratio of 98/1/1 for big data projects and 60/20/20 for smaller data projects\n\nlink\n\nShows that simple data splitting does not give valid confidence intervals (even asymptotically) when one refits the model on the whole dataset. Thus, if one wants valid confidence intervals for prediction error, we can only recommend either data splitting without refitting the model (which is viable when one has ample data), or nested CV.",

McFly’s suggestions are prioritized in real time with a small neural network\n\nPath to a folder that’s above root folder:\n\n1 level up: ../desired-folder\n2 levels up: ../../desired-folder\n\nDebian vs. Ubuntu (from ChatGPT)\n\nStability vs. Freshness:\n\nDebian: Debian is known for its stability and reliability. It has a rigorous testing process and a conservative approach to updates, which makes it suitable for servers and systems where stability is crucial.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu is based on Debian but tends to be more up-to-date with software packages. It follows a time-based release cycle, with regular releases every six months. This can be appealing if you want access to the latest features and software.\n\nPackage Management:\n\nDebian: Debian uses the Debian Package Management System (dpkg) and Advanced Package Tool (APT) for package management. It has a vast repository of software packages.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu also uses dpkg and APT but adds its own software management tools like Snap and Ubuntu Software Center. This can make software installation more user-friendly.\n\nCommunity and Support:\n\nDebian: Debian has a large and dedicated community, and it’s known for its strong commitment to free and open-source software principles. It has a stable support structure, but community support may not be as user-friendly as Ubuntu’s.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu has a large and active community, and it offers both free and paid support options. The Ubuntu community is known for its user-friendliness and helpful forums, making it a good choice for beginners.\n\nVariants and Flavors:\n\nDebian: Debian offers different flavors, known as “Debian spins,” catering to various needs, such as Debian Stable, Debian Testing, and Debian Unstable. These variants differ in terms of software stability and freshness.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu has several official flavors (e.g., Ubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Server, Kubuntu, Xubuntu) that come with different desktop environments. This variety allows users to choose an environment that suits their preferences.\n\nLicensing:\n\nDebian: Debian has a strict commitment to free and open-source software, prioritizing software that adheres to its Free Software Guidelines.\nUbuntu: While Ubuntu also includes mostly free and open-source software, it may include some proprietary drivers and software by default, which can be a concern for users who prioritize a completely open-source system.\n\nPerformance (Google Search AI)\n\nDebian is considered lightweight and much faster than Ubuntu. It comes with few pre-installed software.\n\nHardware (Google Search AI)\n\nDebian works well on older hardware. Debian still offers a 32-bit version of the distro, while Ubuntu no longer offers a 32-bit version.",

But even there I’d recommend quoting.\nWhen you need the unquoted behaviour, using bash arrays will likely serve you much better.\n\nFunctions\n\nUse local variables in functions.\nAccept multiple ways that users can ask for help and respond in kind.\n\nCheck if the first arg is -h or –help or help or just h or even -help, and in all these cases, print help text and exit.\n\nWhen printing error messages, please redirect to stderr.\n\nUse echo 'Something unexpected happened' &gt;&2 for this\n\n\n\n\n\nScripting\n\nUse the .sh (or .bash) extension for your script\nUse long options, where possible (like –silent instead of -s). These serve to document your commands explicitly.\nIf appropriate, change to the script’s directory close to the start of the script.\n\nAnd it’s usually always appropriate.\nUse cd \"$(dirname \"$0\")\", which works in most cases.\n\nUse shellcheck. Heed its warnings.\nShebang line\n\nContains the absolute path of the bash interpreter\n\nList paths to all shells: cat/etc/shells\n\nUse as the first line even if you don’t give executable permission to the script file.\nStarts with “#!” the states the path of the interpreter\nExample: #!/bin/bash\n\nInterpreter installed in directory “/bin”\n\nExample: #!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nCommands that should start your script\n\nUse set -o errexit\n\nSo that when a command fails, bash exits instead of continuing with the rest of the script.\n\nUse set -o nounset\n\nThis will make the script fail, when accessing an unset variable. Saves from horrible unintended consequences, with typos in variable names.\nWhen you want to access a variable that may or may not have been set, use \"${VARNAME-}\" instead of \"$VARNAME\", and you’re good.\n\nUse set -o pipefail\n\nThis will ensure that a pipeline command is treated as failed, even if one command in the pipeline fails.\n\nUse set -o xtrace, with a check on $TRACE env variable.\n\nFor copy-paste: if [[ -n \"${TRACE-}\" ]]; then set -o xtrace; fi.\nThis helps in debugging your scripts, a lot.\nPeople can now enable debug mode, by running your script as TRACE=1 ./script.sh instead of ./script.sh .\n\n\nExample: Basic Execution a Bash Script\n\nCreate a directory bash_script: mkdir bash_script\nCreate a hello_world.sh file: touch hello_script.sh\nOpen hello_script.sh (text editor?)\nAdd code, save, and close\n    #!/bin/bash\n    echo ‘Hello World’\nMake file executable: chmod +x hello_world.sh\nExecute file: ./hello_world.sh\n\nTemplate\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -o errexit\nset -o nounset\nset -o pipefail\nif [[ -n \"${TRACE-}\" ]]; then\n    set -o xtrace\nfi\nif [[ \"$1\" =~ ^-*h(elp)?$ ]]; then\n    echo 'Usage: ./script.sh arg-one arg-two\nThis is an awesome bash script to make your life better.\n'\n    exit\nfi\ncd \"$(dirname \"$0\")\"\nmain() {\n    echo do awesome stuff\n}\nmain \"$@\"\n\n\n\nJob Management\n\nPrograms/Scripts will by default run in the foreground, and prevent you from doing anything else until the program is done.\nWhile program is running:\n\ncontrol+c - Will send a SIGINT (signal interrupt) signal to the program, which instructs the machine to interrupt the program immediately (unless the program has a way to handle these signals internally).\ncontrol+z - Will pause the program.\n\nAfter pausing the program can be continued either by bringing it to the foreground (fg), or by sending it to the backgroud (bg).\n\n\nExecute script to run in the background: python run.py &\njobs - shows all running jobs and process ids (PIDS)\nkill - sends signals to jobs running in the background\n\nkill -STOP %1 sends a STOP signal, pausing program 1.\nkill -KILL %1 sends a KILL signal, terminating program 1 permanently.\n\n\n\n\ntmux (‘terminal multiplexer’)\n\nEnables you to easily create new terminal sessions and navigate between them. This can be extremely useful, for example you can use one terminal to navigate your file system and another terminal to execute jobs.\nInstallation (if necessary): sudo apt install tmux\n\nTypically comes with the linux installation\n\nSessions\n\ntmux - starts an unnamed session\ntmux new -s moose creates new terminal session with name ‘moose’\ntmux ls - lists all running sessions\ntmux kill-session -t moose - kills session named “moose”\nexit - stops and quits the current session\nKill all sessions (various opinions on how to do this)\n\ntmux kill-session\ntmux kill-server\ntmux ls | grep : | cut -d. -f1 | awk '{print substr($1, 0, length($1)-1)}' | xargs kill\n\n\nAttach/Detach\n\nWhen you log out of a remote machine (either on purpose or accidentally), all of the programs that were actively running inside your shell are automatically terminated. On the other hand, if you run your programs inside a tmux shell, you can come simply detach the tmux window, log out, close your computer, and come back to that shell later as if you’ve never been logged out.\ntmux detach - detach current session\ncontrol+bthen pressd`: When you have multiple sesssions running, this will allow you to select the session to detach\nFrom inside bash and not inside a session\n\ntmux a : attach to latest created session\ntmux a -t moose : attach to session called ‘moose’\n\n\nPane Creation and Navigation\n\ncontrol+b then press ” (i.e. shift+’): add another terminal pane below\ncontrol+b then press % (i.e. shift+5) : add another terminal pane to the right\ncontrol+b then press → : move to the terminal pane on the right (similar for left, up, down)\n\n\n\n\nSSH\n\nTypically uses a key pair to log into remote machines\n\nKey pair consists of a public key (which both machines have access to) and a private key (which only your own machine has access to)\n“ssh-keygen” is a program for generating such a key pair.\n\nIf you run ssh-keygen, it will by default create a public key named “id_rsa.pub” and a private key named “id_rsa”, and place both into your “~/.ssh” directory\nYou’ll need to add the public key to the remote machine by piping together cat, ssh, and a streaming operator\n\ncat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remote 'cat &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'\n\n\n\nConnect to the remote machine: ssh remote -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nCreate a config file instead\n\nLocation: “~/.ssh/config”\nContents\nHost dev\n  HostName remote\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nConnect using config: ssh dev\nFor Windows and using Putty, see\n\nAWS &gt;&gt; EC2 &gt;&gt; Connect to/ Terminate Instance\nProjects Notebook &gt;&gt; Article, Nested Cross Validation &gt;&gt; Notes &gt;&gt; Running EC2 instances checklist\n\n\n\n\nVim\n\nCommand-line based text editor\nCommon Usage\n\nLogging into a remote machine and need to make a code change there. vim is a standard program and therefore usually available on any machine you work on.\nWhen running git commit, by default git opens vim for writing a commit message. So at the very least you’ll want to know how to write, save, and close a file.\n\n2 modes: Navigation Mode; Edit Mode\n\nWhen Vim is launched you’re in Navigation mode\nPress i to start edit mode, in which you can make changes to the file.\nPress Esc key to leave edit mode and go back to navigation mode.\n\nCommands (Cheatsheet)\n\nx deletes a character\ndd deletes an entire row\nb (back) goes to the previous word\nn (next) goes to the next word\n:wq saves your changes and closes the file\n:q! ignores your changes and closes the file\n\n\n\n\nPackages\n\nCommon package managers: apt, Pacman, yum, and portage\nAPT (Advanced Package Tool)\n\nInstall Packages\n# one pkg\nsudo apt-get install &lt;package_name&gt;\n# multiple\nsudo apt-get install &lt;pkg_name1&gt; &lt;pkg_name2&gt;\n\nInstall but no upgrade: sudo apt-get install &lt;pkg_name&gt; --no-upgrade\n\nSearch for an installed package: apt-cache search &lt;pkg_name&gt;\nUpdate package information prior to “upgrading” the packages\nsudo apt-get update\n\nDownloads the package lists from the repositories and “updates” them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies.\n\nUpgrade\n# all installed packages\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n# To upgrade only a specific program\nsudo apt-get upgrade &lt;package_name&gt;\n\n# Upgrades and handles dependencies; delete obsolete, add new\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\n# together\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\n\n\nExpressions\n\nSort data, filter only unique lines, and write to file: cat adult_t.csv | sort | uniq -c &gt; sorted_list.csv",

It has a rigorous testing process and a conservative approach to updates, which makes it suitable for servers and systems where stability is crucial.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu is based on Debian but tends to be more up-to-date with software packages. It follows a time-based release cycle, with regular releases every six months. This can be appealing if you want access to the latest features and software.\n\nPackage Management:\n\nDebian: Debian uses the Debian Package Management System (dpkg) and Advanced Package Tool (APT) for package management. It has a vast repository of software packages.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu also uses dpkg and APT but adds its own software management tools like Snap and Ubuntu Software Center. This can make software installation more user-friendly.\n\nCommunity and Support:\n\nDebian: Debian has a large and dedicated community, and it’s known for its strong commitment to free and open-source software principles. It has a stable support structure, but community support may not be as user-friendly as Ubuntu’s.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu has a large and active community, and it offers both free and paid support options. The Ubuntu community is known for its user-friendliness and helpful forums, making it a good choice for beginners.\n\nVariants and Flavors:\n\nDebian: Debian offers different flavors, known as “Debian spins,” catering to various needs, such as Debian Stable, Debian Testing, and Debian Unstable. These variants differ in terms of software stability and freshness.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu has several official flavors (e.g., Ubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Server, Kubuntu, Xubuntu) that come with different desktop environments. This variety allows users to choose an environment that suits their preferences.\n\nLicensing:\n\nDebian: Debian has a strict commitment to free and open-source software, prioritizing software that adheres to its Free Software Guidelines.\nUbuntu: While Ubuntu also includes mostly free and open-source software, it may include some proprietary drivers and software by default, which can be a concern for users who prioritize a completely open-source system.\n\nPerformance (Google Search AI)\n\nDebian is considered lightweight and much faster than Ubuntu. It comes with few pre-installed software.\n\nHardware (Google Search AI)\n\nDebian works well on older hardware. Debian still offers a 32-bit version of the distro, while Ubuntu no longer offers a 32-bit version.",

Instead of the dash, you can also see a “d” for directory or “l” for a symbolic link.\n\nchmod - edit permissions\n\nExample: chmod u+x my_program.py - makes this file executable for yourself\n\nsudo - “super user” - using this prefix gives you all the permissions to all the files\n\nsudo su - opens a stand alone super user shell\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\nPrint file content\ncat &lt; my_file.txt\n# or\ncat my_file.txt\nPrint 1 pg at a time: less my_file.txt\nPrint specific number of lines: head -n&lt;num_lines&gt; &lt;file.csv&gt;\nPrint file content from bottom to top: tac my_file.txt\ncat -b log.txt | grep error : shows all lines in log.txt that contain the string ‘error’, along with the line number (-b)\n\n\n\nLogicals and Conditionals\n\nLogicals\n\n; : command1 ; command2\n\ncommand 1 and command 2 run independently of each other\n\n& : command1 & command2\n\ncommand 1 runs in the background and command 2 runs in the background\n\n&& : command1 && command2\n\nIf the first command errors out then the second command is not executed\n\n|| : command1 || command2\n\nThe second commmand is only execute if the first command errors\n\nExample\ncd my_dir && pwd || echo “No such directory exist.Check”\n\nIf the my_dir exists, then the current working directory is printed. If the my_dir doesn’t exist, then the message “No such directory exists. check” message is printed.\n\n\nConditionals\n\nUse [[ ]] for conditions in if / while statements, instead of [ ] or test.\n\n[[ ]] is a bash builtin, and is more powerful than [ ] or test.\nExample: if [[ -n \"${TRACE-}\" ]]; then set -o xtrace; fi\n\n\n\n\n\nString Matching\n\nExample: Search for “error” and write to file\n#output to a file again\ncat file1 file2 file3 | grep error | cat &gt; error_file.txt\n#Append to the end\ncat file1 file2 file3 | grep error | cat &gt;&gt; error_file.txt\n\nPrints lines into grep which searches for “error” in each line. Lines with “error” get written to “error_file.txt”\n\nFilter lines\ngrep -i “Doctorate” adult_t.csv |grep -i “Husband”|grep -i “Black”|csvlook\n# -i, --ignore-case-Ignore  case  distinctions,  so that characters that differ only in case match each other.\n\nSelect all the candidates who have doctorates and a husband and race are Black\ncsvlook is pretty printing from csvkit package (see Big Data &gt;&gt; Larger Than Memory &gt;&gt; csvkit)\n\nCount how many rows fit the criteria\ngrep -i “Doctorate” adult_t.csv | wc -l\n\nCounts how many rows have “Doctorate”\n\n-wc is “word count”",

Rarely will your model produce the Expected Coverage exactly\n\nAdaptive Coverage: Setting your Expected Coverage so that your Empirical Coverage = Target Coverage. A conformal prediction algorithm is adaptive if it not only achieves marginal coverage, but also (approximately) conditional coverage\n\nExample: 90% target coverage\n\nIf our model is slightly overfit, you might see that a 90% expected coverage leads to an 85% empirical coverage on a holdout dataset. To align your target and empirical coverage at 90%, may require setting expected coverage at something like 93%\n\n\nExpected Coverage: The level of confidence in the model for the prediction intervals.\nConditional Coverage: The coverage for each individual class of the outcome variable or subset of data specified by a grouping variable.\nMarginal Coverage: The overall average coverage across all classes of the outcome variable. All conformal methods achieve at or near the Expected Coverage averaged across classes but not necessarily for each individual class.\nTarget Coverage: The level of coverage you want to attain on a holdout dataset\n\ni.e. The proportion of observations you want to fall within your prediction intervals\n\n\nJeffrey’s Interval: Bayesian CIs for Binomial proportions (i.e. probability of an event)\n# probability of event\n# n_rain in the number of events (rainy days)\n# n is the number of trials (total days)\nmutate(pct_rain = n_rain / n, \n       # jeffreys interval\n       # bayesian CI for binomial proportions\n       low = qbeta(.025, n_rain + .5, n - n_rain + .5), \n       high = qbeta(.975, n_rain + .5, n - n_rain + .5))\nPrediction Interval: Used to estimate the range within which a future observation is likely to fall\n\nStandard Procedure for computing PIs for predictions (See link for examples and further details)\n\\[\n\\hat Y_0 \\pm t^{n-p}_{\\alpha/2} \\;\\hat\\sigma \\sqrt{1 + \\vec x_0'(X'X)^{-1}\\vec x_0}\n\\]\n\n\\(Y_0\\) is a single prediction\n\\(t\\) is the t-stat for\n\n\\(n-p\\) = sample size - number of predictors\n\\(1 - \\alpha\\) for 2-sided; \\(1 - (\\alpha/2)\\) for 1 sided (I think)\n\n\\(\\hat\\sigma\\) is the variance given by residual standard error, summary(Model1)$sigma\n\\[\nS^2 = \\frac{1}{n-p}\\;||\\;Y-X\\hat \\beta\\;||^2\n\\]\n\n\\(S = \\hat \\sigma\\)\nI think this is also the \\(\\operatorname{MSE}/\\operatorname{dof}\\) that you sometimes see in other formulas\n\n\\(x_0\\) is new data for the predictor variable values for the prediction (also would need to include a 1 for the intercept)\n\\((X'X)^{-1}\\) is the variance covariance matrix, vcov(model)",

Computes conformal PIs for Regression, Classification, and Time Series models.\n\nRegression\n\nMethods: naive, split, jackknife, jackknife+, jackknife-minmax, jackknife-after-bootstrap, CV, CV+, CV-minmax, ensemble batch prediction intervals (EnbPI).\n“Since the typical coverage levels estimated by jackknife+ follow very closely the target coverage levels, this method should be used when accurate and robust prediction intervals are required.”\n“For practical applications where N is large and/or the computational time of each leave-one-out simulation is high, it is advised to adopt the CV+ method” even though the interval width will be slightly larger than jackknife+\n“The jackknife-minmax and CV-minmax methods are more conservative since they result in higher theoretical and practical coverages due to the larger widths of the prediction intervals. It is therefore advised to use them when conservative estimates are needed.”\n“The conformalized quantile regression method allows for more adaptiveness on the prediction intervals which becomes key when faced with heteroscedastic data.”\nEnbPI is for time series and residuals must be updated each time new observations are available\n\nClassification\n\nMethods: LAC, Top-K, Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS), Regularized Adaptive Prediction Sets (RAPS), Split and Cross-Conformal methods.\nThe difference between these methods is the way the conformity scores are computed\nLAC method is not adaptive: the coverage guarantee only holds on average (i.e. marginal coverage). Difficult classification cases may have prediction sets that are too small, and easy cases may have sets that are too large. (See below for details on process). Doesn’t seem like to great a task to manually make it adaptive though (See example below).\nAPS’ conformity score used to determine the threshold is a constrained sum of the predicted probabilities for that observation. Only the predicted probabilites \\(\\ge\\) the predicted probability of the true class are included in the sum. Everything else is the same as the LAC algorithm, although the default behavior is to keep the last class that crosses the threshold through the argument, include_last_label = [True, “randomized”, False]. The value of the argument can determine whether conditional coverage is (approximately) attained with True being the most liberal setting. Note that only “randomized” can produce empty predicted class sets. Algorithm tends to produce large predicted class sets when there are many classes in the outcome variable.\nRAPS attenuates the lengthier predicted class sets in APS through regularization. A penalty, \\(\\lambda\\), is added to predicted probabilities with ranks greater that some value, \\(k\\). Everything else is the same as APS.\nNot sure what Split is, but Cross-Conformal is CV applied to LAC and APS.\n\n\n\nNotes from\n\nHow to Handle Uncertainty in Forecasts: A deep dive into conformal prediction\n\nThe conformity score formula used in this article, \\(s_i = |\\;y_i - \\hat p_i(y_i\\;|\\;X_i)\\;|\\) where \\(y_i\\) is the observed class and \\(\\hat p\\) is the predicted probability, has the same results as to the one below, but it’s not workable in production since there is no observed class.\n\nConformal Prediction for Machine Learning Classification — From the Ground Up\n“MAPIE” Explained Exactly How You Wished Someone Explained to You\n\nResources\n\nIntroduction To Conformal Prediction With Python A Short Guide for Quantifying Uncertainty of Machine Learning Models\n\nSee R &gt;&gt; Documents &gt;&gt; Machine Learning\n\n\nNormal PIs require iid data while conformal PIs only require the “identically distributed” part (not independent) and therefore should provide more robust coverage.\nContinuous outcome (link) using quantile regression\n\n\n\nClassification\n\nLAC (aka Score Method) Process\n\nSplit data into Train, Calibration (aka Validation), and Test\nTrain the model on the training set\nOn the calibration (aka validation) set, compute the conformity scores only for the observed class (i.e. true label) for each observation\n\\[\ns_{i, j}  = 1 - \\hat p_{i,j}(y_i | X_i)\n\\]\n\nVariables\n\n\\(s_{i,j}\\): Conformity Score for the ith observation and class \\(j\\)\n\\(y_i\\): Observed Class\n\\(\\hat p_{i,j}\\): Predicted probability by the model for class \\(j\\)\n\\(X_i\\): Predictors\n\\(i\\): Index of the observed data\n\\(j\\): Class of the outcome variable\n\nRange: [0, 1]\nIn general, Low = good, High = bad\nIn R, the predicted probabilities for statistical models are always for the event (i.e. \\(y_i = 1\\)) in a binary outcome context, so when the observed class = 0, the score will be \\(s_{i,0} = 1-(1- \\hat p_{i, 1}(y_i | X_i)) = \\hat p_{i, 1}(y_i | X_i)\\) which is just the predicted probability.\n\nOrder the conformity scores from highest to lowest\nAdjust the chosen the \\(\\alpha\\) using a finite sample correction, \\(q_{\\text{level}} = 1- \\frac{ceil((n_{\\text{cal}}+1)\\alpha)}{n_{\\text{cal}}}\\) and calculate the quantile.\nCalculate the critical value or threshold for the quantile\n\n\nx-axis corresponds to an ordered set of conformity scores\nIf \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), find the score value at the the 95th percentile (e.g. quantile(scores, 0.95))\nBlue: conformity scores are not statistically significant. They’re within our prediction interval.\nRed: Very large conformity scores indicate high divergence from the true label. These conformal scores are statistically significant and thereby outside of our prediction interval.\n\nPredict on the Test set and calculate conformity scores for each class\nFor each test set observation, select classes that have scores below the threshold score as the model prediction.\n\nAn observation could potentially have both classes or no classes selected.

The following programs are free(-ish) local alternatives only limited by your RAM.\nSuggest for files over a few hundred MBs that you open as Read-Only\n\nOpening the files as “Editable” will probably balloon the memory cost to at least 5 times the file size. (e.g. 350MB csv \\(\\rightarrow\\) 2GB RAM)\n\nModern CSV - Nice modern interface, read-only mode that can open large csvs (100s of MBs) without making much of a dent in your RAM, fully featured (moreso if you pay a small-ish one time fee)\n\nDocs, Feature free/upgrade list\nStill has some functionality in read-only mode (e.g. search, sort)\n\nOpenRefine - Has read-only, Several add-ons, Completely open source.\n\nDocs, List of Extensions\nNo functionality when read-only (must create a project to do anything) — just reading\nStarts with a 1024 MB RAM usage limit which is proably fine for editing around a 100MB csv. Need to set the limit higher in a config file in order to edit larger files.\nOnce you create a project, I think it has some editing features that you’d have to pay for with Modern CV.\nOpens other file formats besides csv (e.g. xlsx, xml, json, etc)\n\n\nxsv - A command line program for indexing, slicing, analyzing, splitting, and joining CSV files. Written in Rust.\n\nIsn’t well maintained.

If during the navigation of the location path, a field is not found, then the expression returns nothing.\n\nThis can be beneficial in certain scenarios where the structure of the input JSON can vary and doesn’t always contain the same fields.\n\nTreats single values and arrays containing a single value as equivalent\nBoth JSONata and jq can work in the browser (JSONata embedding code, demo), but jq has a slight speed edge thanks to WASM. However, said edge comes at the cost of a slow-first-start\n\nFeatures\n\nDeclarative syntax that is pretty easy to read and write, which allows us to focus on the desired output rather than the procedural steps required to achieve it\nBuilt-in operators and functions for manipulating and combining data, making it easier to perform complex transformations without writing custom code in a traditional programming language like python or javascript\nUser-defined functions that let us extend JSONata’s capabilities and tailor it to our specific needs\nFlexible output structure that lets us format query results into pretty much any output type\n\n\njq + jsonlite - json files\njsoncrack.com - online editor/tool to visualize nested json (or regular json)\njj - cli tool for nested json.

Thing that has R and the main packages you need to load onto the cloud server\nAnti-Patterns - certain patterns in software development that are considered bad programming practices.\n\nAs opposed to design patterns which are common approaches to common problems which have been formalized and are generally considered a good development practice, anti-patterns are the opposite and are undesirable.\n\nArm - a group of patients receiving a specific treatment (or no treatment). Trials involving several arms, or randomized trials, treat randomly-selected groups of patients with different therapies in order to compare their medical outcomes. Experimental arms, which receive an experimental drug, are compared with control arms. Single-arm or non-randomized trials, in which everyone enrolled in a trial receives the experimental therapy\nArtifacts - objects that are created as a result of a process. e.g. model objects, cleaned data sets, visuals, etc.\nAsynchronous Programming - code runs (or must run) after something else happens and also not sequentially (e.g. when a function calls a callback function in JS).\nAthena - amazon query service that works with S3. Best for analyses using kubernetes. ODBC drivers are best with interactive app\nB2C, B2B - business-to-consumer, business-to-business, describes a business that’s end-product is being sold to a consumer or a business.\nBalanced Design (aka orthogonal) has an equal number of observations for all possible level combinations. For example in an experiment where gender is an independent variable, an equal number of males receive the treatment as do females receive treatment. If the male/female counts were unequal, then the experiment is unbalanced.\n\nStat tests have greater power for balanced designs\nTest stat less susceptible to to small departures from the assumption of equal variances (homoscedasticity).\n\nBatch - collect a large number of data points, process them periodically and store results somewhere (contrasts with real-time in which a data input leads to an immediate prediction)\nBootstrapping (CS) - usually applies to a situation where a system depends on itself to start, sort of a chicken and egg problem. (e.g. How do you start an OS initialization process if you don’t have the OS running yet?) Typically a simple file that starts a large process.\nBounce, Email - When an email cannot be delivered to an email server.\n\nHard Bounce - indicates a permanent reason an email cannot be delivered (e.g. Recipient email address doesn’t exist; Recipient email server has completely blocked delivery)\nSoft Bounce - indicates a temporary delivery issue (for details on the reasons, see link)\n\nBounce Rate - the percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page. Low bounce rate can indicate the landing page needs improvement\nBPI - Business process improvement is a management exercise in which enterprise leaders use various methodologies to analyze their procedures to identify areas where they can improve accuracy, effectiveness and/or efficiency and then redesign those processes to realize the improvements.\nBLUE - best linear unbiased estimator, e.g. regression line\nCAC - customer acquisition cost - measures how much an organization spends to acquire new customers. The total cost of sales and marketing efforts, as well as property or equipment, needed to convince a customer to buy a product or service.\nCapEx - Capital Expenditure - 1 of 2 main forward budgeting mechanisms for a corporation (also see OpEx).

This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.\nComplete Factorial Design - a research study involving two or more independent variables in which every possible combination of the levels of each variable is represented. For instance, in a study of two drug treatments, one (A) having two dosages and the other (B) having three dosages, a complete factorial design would pair the dosages administered to different individuals or groups of participants as follows: A1 with B1, A1 with B2, A1 with B3, A2 with B1, A2 with B2, and A2 with B3.\nCPG - Consumer packaged goods are items used daily by average consumers that require routine replacement or replenishment, such as food, beverages, clothes, tobacco, makeup, and household products.\nCPC - Cost Per Click - refers to the cost an advertiser pays each time an online user clicks on his or her digital ad\nCRM - customer relationship management i.e. customer service. Salesforce tracks this data. Example: what features your salesperson promised, and when? How much revenue you have from each customer? Or which salesperson sold the most in the past year?\ncron- standard tool used on Unix and Unix-like systems to schedule the periodic execution in the background of a command or script (like a batch script)\nCrossed Factors - when every category of one factor co-occurs in the design with every category of the other factor. In other words, there is at least one observation in every combination of categories for the two factors. (in contrast to “nested factors”). As a consequence, interaction terms involving these two factors is allowed.\nCrossover Study - A type of clinical trial in which the study participants receive each treatment in a random order. With this type of study, every patient serves as his or her own control. Crossover studies are often used when researchers feel it would be difficult to recruit participants willing to risk going without a promising new treatment.\nCross-Section Data - randomly sampled data from a population. Like a survey. Aka observational data. See experimental data for comparison.\n\nPooled - differs from panel data in that it is observations of different subjects (instead of the same subjects) in different time periods.\nRolling - both the presence of an individual in the sample and the time at which the individual is included in the sample are determined randomly.\n\nCross-Tabs - section of survey analysis where the aggregated results are broken down by demography, party affiliation, etc.\nCTA - marketing term, call-to-action. any device designed to prompt an immediate response or encourage an immediate sale; words or phrases that can be incorporated into sales scripts, advertising messages or web pages that encourage consumers to take prompt action\nCTR - click through rate: the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.\nCRM - Customer Relationship Management - acquiring new customers but especially about retaining existing ones\nDAU - daily active users, ex: daily avg # of registered users of the site over past 30 days\nDBA - Database Administrator is an admin role that understands the particular database technology and how to get the best out of it. This includes improving performance, backups and recovery.\nDDL - Data definition or description language - Subset of SQL. Used to:\n\nKeep a snapshot of the database structure\nSet up a test system where the database acts like the production system but contains no data\nProduce templates for new objects that you can create based on existing ones. For example, generate the DDL for the Customer table, then edit the DDL to create the table Customer_New with the same schema.\n\nDesparate Impact Analysis - Analysis of the result of the application of a standard, requirement, test or other screening tool used for selection that—though appearing neutral—has an adverse effect on individuals who belong to a legally protected class Differential Dropout**]{style=‘color: #009499’} - Differing dropout rates between treatment arms\nDMA - Designated Market Area; a geographic region where Nielsen, the ratings company, analyzes and quantifies how television is viewed. Residents can receive the same local TV and radio stations\nDNS -  Domain Name System**]{style=‘color: #009499’} -  translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.\nDSL - domain-specific language - a computer language specialized to a particular application domain\nEMR - Amazon version of a spark cluster used for big data processing and analysis.\nEndogenous - A model variable is correlated with other variables excluded from the model (omitted variable bias). Determined by measuring the correlation between the variable and residuals of the model. If a predictor variable hasn’t been randomly assigned, it’s likely to be endogenous.\nEquitability - concept that says a dependence measure should give equal importance to linear and nonlinear relationships. Consistent strength measurements across different variable relationships that have similar amounts of noise.\nERP - enterprise resource planning, sort of a catch-all for manufacturing, supply-chain, etc, see the wiki\nETL - extract, transfer, load - usually refers to transferring data from one location to another\nEndpoint (biostats) - Outcome variable measured in a medical study. e.g. Death, stroke, or quality of life are good endpoints. Blood tests and images on scans are not good endpoints.\n\nA composite endpoint is one that consists of two or more events\n\nExample: death due to cardiovascular causes or hospitalization due to heart failure\n\nSo the binary outcome would be a 1 if either of those events took place or a 0 if they did not. Or in a survival model, time until either of those events.\n\n\n\nEOF - End of file - Input from a terminal never really “ends” (unless the device is disconnected), but it is useful to enter more than one “file” into a terminal, so a key sequence is reserved to indicate end of input.\nex ante - based on assumption and prediction and being essentially subjective and estimative\nex post - based on knowledge and retrospection and being essentially objective and factual\nExperimental Data - data from a RCE/RCT. Compare with observational data\nFaaS - Function as a service - type of cloud service for developing, running, and managing apps (e.g. AWS Lambda)\nFactorial Design - Experiment where you’re interested in the effect of two or more independent variables.\nFraud Rules - fraud scores are calculated based on rules, which add or subtract points.

Scoring determined by fraud rules.\nFuzzy Design - See Sharp Design\nGHA - Github Actions\nGMV - Gross merchandises value - the total value of merchandise sold over a given period of time through a customer-to-customer (C2C) exchange site\nGRP - Gross Rating Point. A standard measure in advertising, it measures advertising impact. You calculate it as a percent of the target market reached multiplied by the exposure frequency. Thus, if you get advertise to 30% of the target market and give them 4 exposures, you would have 120 GRP.\nHTE - Heterogeneous Treatment Effect - Also called differential treatment effect, includes difference of means, odds ratios, and Hazard ratios for time-to-event outcome vars\n\nAscertaining subpopulations for which a treatment is most beneficial (or harmful) is an important goal of many clinical trials.\nOutcome heterogeneity is due to wide distributions of baseline prognostic factors. When strong risk factors exist, there is hetergeneity in the outcome variable.\n\nSolution: add baseline predictors to your model that account for these strong risk factors.\n\nHeterogeneity of Treatment Effects - The degree to which different treatments have differential causal effects on each unit.\n\nHit Ratio - percent of records that were read in order to complete a query in a database. Cloud db providers often charge by the number of records searched\nHomogeneity of Treatment Effects - See Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects\nHPC - High Performance Computing\nHoneypot - data (for example, in a network site) that appears to be a legitimate part of the site, but is actually isolated and monitored, and that seems to contain information or a resource of value to attackers, who are then blocked.\nIaaS - infrastructure-as-a-service ( Hardware is provided by an external provider and managed for you)\nIAM - identity and access management, keys and passwords etc\nIRB - institutional review board, reviews studies ethical and moral issues\nITT - Intent-to-Treat analysis includes all randomized patients in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of their adherence with the entry criteria, regardless of the treatment they actually received, and regardless of subsequent withdrawal from treatment or deviation from the protocol. Avoids overoptimistic estimates of the efficacy of an intervention resulting from the removal of non-compliers by accepting that noncompliance and protocol deviations are likely to occur in actual clinical practice. So mimics likely situation in the real world, but not good for estimating the causal effect of a treatment.\nKernels - (article) - system kernels - the interface between the operating system, i.e. the software, and the hardware components in a device. It is used in all devices with an operating system, for example, computers, laptops, smartphones, smartwatches, etc.\n\nWhen we use a program on a computer, such as Excel, we handle it on the so-called Graphical User Interface (GUI). The program converts every button click or other action into machine code and sends it to the operating system kernel. If we want to add a new column in an Excel table, this call goes to the system core. This in turn passes the call on to the computer processing unit (CPU), which executes the action.\nJupyter Kernels - an engine that executes notebook code and is specific to a particular programming language (e.g. python kernel)\nKaggle Kernels - a free platform from Kaggle to run Jupyter notebooks in the browser. Advantage is that you don’t have to set-up an environment locally.\n\nKPI- key performance indicator\nKYC - Know-Your-Customer is info a company collects to verify your identity to combat fraud. Used by telecoms and financial services\nLazy Evaluation - ” never pulls data into R unless you explicitly ask for it. It delays doing any work until the last possible moment.

Goal is to search for parameter values until the likelihood is maximized.\nLOB - Line of Business is a general term which refers to a product or a set of related products that serve a particular customer transaction or business need. (i.e. product categories)\n\nExamples\n\nConsumer Banking: credit cards, line of credit or loan program, mortgages, and corporate, small business and personal bank accounts.\nFinancial services and brokerages: mergers and acquisitions or partnerships, real estate investments, and wealth management\nProperty and casualty insurance companies: property and casualty insurance (i.e., homeowners, car, boat, renters, etc.), life insurance, health insurance, and commercial business insurance.\n\nSub-lines of Business would be sub-categories within each LOB\n\nLongitudinal Data - see panel data\nLTV - see CLV/CLTV\nManual Review - A human is reviews the case to determine whether action is needed. In fraud, an model output may trigger a “manual review” to determine whether an event was indeed fraudulent.\nMLlib - Apache Spark machine learning library\nMVC - Minimum Viable Corpus - a data size threshold; such that below this threshold, the data simply isn’t useful/valuable.

Normally it follows a format that can be used for comparative purposes. An RFI is primarily used to gather information to help make a decision on what steps to take next. RFIs are therefore seldom the final stage and are instead often used in combination with request for proposal (RFP), request for tender (RFT), and request for quotation (RFQ).\nRFM - recency, frequency, monetary value - method of estimating customer value; common in retail\nRFP - Request for Proposal - A document that an organization, often a government agency or large enterprise, posts to elicit a response – a formal bid – from potential vendors for a desired solution. The RFP specifies what the customer is looking for and describes each evaluation criterion on which a vendor’s proposal will be assessed.\n\nROAS - return on ad spend\nRUG - Regional User Group\nS3 - Amazon simple storage service, database\nSaaS - Software-as-a-service is a mechanism through which companies offer the functionality of their apps, which remain on their company servers, to other companies or customers.\nSCO - sales cycle optimization, active process of providing content on your site (and beyond) that speaks to each of the key phases\nSEO - Search engine optimization, generating high page rankings for key search terms\nSDK - software development kit\nSharp Design - Each individual or group receives the same “amount” of treatment (e.g. a state law or medication dosage). Opposite being fuzzy design (?)\nSKU - Stock Keeping Unit**]{style=‘color: #009499’} - Usually a bar code that has all the information to distinguish it from another product. These attributes can include manufacturer, description, material, size, color, packaging, and warranty terms. When a business takes inventory of its stock, it counts the quantity it has of each SKU.\nSLA - service level agreement - a contract between a service provider and its internal or external customers that documents what services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards this provider is obligated to meet. service. Important for holding prediction latency of an app to a certain standard or maintaining data reliability with vendors. (see link for more details on SLA, SLO, and SLI)\nSLI - service level indicators - metrics that measure compliance with an SLO (see link for more details on SLA, SLO, and SLI)\nSLO - service level objectives - objectives your team must meet in order to meet the conditions of the SLA (see link for more details on SLA, SLO, and SLI)\nSMB - (small to medium-sized business) generally defined as companies with fewer than 1000 employees and less than $1 billion in annual revenue.\nSME - Subject Matter Experts\nSPC - Statistical process control is a method of quality control which employs statistical methods to monitor and control a process\nSpill - missed opportunity metric, measures “lost trading days” on which flights or hotels filled too quickly (the result of pricing too low)\nSpoil - missed opportunity metric, measures empty seats or rooms (often the result of pricing too high)\nSSH - secure shell is a cryptographic Network protocol for operating Network Services securely over an unsecured Network. Typical applications include remote command line login in remote command execution\nstdout - standard output, which is the terminal by default\nTDD - Test-driven development is a style of programming where coding, testing, and design are tightly interwoven\nTF-IDF- stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency, and is often used in information retrieval and text mining.\nThroughput - the amount of material or items passing through a system or process.\ntx - treatment, seen as variable with different treatments as values\nURI - Uniform Resource Identifier - a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource. e.g. s3//bucket/path/to/folder or http://127.0.0.1:5000or c:\\Users\\me\\path\\to\\folder\nUTM - Urchin Traffic Monitor - used to identify marketing channels\n\ne.g. http://yourwebsite.com/your-post-title/?utm_source=google\n\nutm code = string after “?”\n\nThis person clicked a google ad to get to your site\n\nName comes from Urchin Tracker, a web analytics software that served as the base for Google Analytics.\n\nVPS - virtual private server\nWIP - Work-in-Progress\nWithin Person Study - multiple treatments on each person either all in the same period or different treatments in different periods\nYear-Over-Year - used to make comparisons between one time period and another that is one year earlier.\n\nFormula (percentage): (value_this_year / value_previous_year) - 1\nExample: (sales_Jul_2023 / sales_Jul_2022) - 1",

Create a “requirements.txt” file, delete the virtual environment and create a new one.\nDon’t rename a directory containing a virtual environment. Or if you do, prepare yourself to create a “requirements.txt” file, delete the virtual environment and create a new one.\nIf you change the Python used in the virtual environment, such as when uninstalling it, it will stop working.\n\nCreate one big virtual environment for all small scripts.\n\nIf you make a lot of venv, you may be tempted to install everything at the system level for convenience. After all, it’s a bore to create and activate a virtual environment each time you want to write a five liner. A good balance is one single virtual environment you use for all things quick and dirty.\n\nCreate several virtual environments per versions of python if your project needs to support several versions.

[4,8]\n\nWork inside out (locate where the data object, arr, appears)\n“arr” is filtered by the first lambda function for even numbers then iterated by map to be squared by the second lambda function\n\n\nIterate over rows of a column in a df\n\nExample: Using formula over rows\ngrade['evaluate']=grade['MathScore'].apply(lambda x: round((x**x)/2,2))\n\n“grade” is the df; “MathScore” is a numeric column; “evaluate” is the new column in the df\nFormula applied to each value of “MathScore” to generate each value of evaluate\n\nExample: Conditional over rows\ngrade['group']=grade['MathScore'].apply(lambda x: 'Excellent' if x&gt;=3.0 else 'Average')\n\n“grade” is the df; “MathScore” is a numeric column; “group” is the new column in the df\nConditional applied to each value of “MathScore” to generate each value of “group”\n\nUsing {{swifter}} for parallelization\nimport swifter\ndf['e'] = df.swifter.apply(lambda x: infer(x['a'], x['b'], x['c'], x['d']), axis = 1)\n\nIn a Pivot Table (like a crosstab)\n\nExample\n\ngrades_df\n\n2 names (“name”)\n6 scores (“score”)\nOnly 2 letter grades associated with these scores (“letter grade”)\n\nTask: drop lowest score for each letter grade, then calculate the average score for each letter grade\n\ngrades_df.pivot_table(index='name',\n                      columns='letter grade',\n                      values='score',\n                      aggfunc = lambda series : (sorted(list(series))[-1] + sorted(list(series))[-2]) / 2)\n\nletter grade    A    B\nname\nArif          96.5  87.0\nKayla        95.5  84.0\n\nindex: each row will be a “name”\ncolumns: each column will be a “letter grade”\nvalues: value in the cells will be from the “score” column according to each combination columns in the index and columns args\naggfunc: uses a lambda to compute the aggregated values\n\n“series” is used a the variable  in the lambda function\nsorts series (ascending), takes the top two values (using negative list indexing), and averages them\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope\n\nPopulated objects within functions persist if you instantiate the object in the argument\n\n\n“all_numbers” retained it’s previous value when the 2nd call to the function was made\n\n\n\n\nClosures\n\nInner functions that can access values in the outer function, even after the outer function has finished its execution\nExample\n\n# closure way\ndef balanceOwed(roomN,rate,nights):\n    def increaseByMeals(extra):\n        amountOwned=rate*nights+extra\n        print(f\"Dear Guest of Room [{roomN}]{style='color: #990000'}, you have\", \n        \"a due balance:\", \"${:.2f}\".format(amountOwned))\n        return amountOwned\n    return increaseByMeals\n\nba = balanceOwned(201,400,3)\nba(200)\nba(150)\nba(180)\nba(190)\nDear Guest of Room 201, you have a due balance: $1400.00\nDear Guest of Room 201, you have a due balance: $1350.00\nDear Guest of Room 201, you have a due balance: $1380.00\nDear Guest of Room 201, you have a due balance: $1390.00\n\nTedious way: For each value of “extra” (e.g. meals), the function needs to be called even if the other values of the arguments don’t change.\nClosure way:\n\nincreaseByMeals() is a closure function, because it remembers the values of the outer function balanceOwed(), even after the execution of the latter\nbalanceOwed() is called with its three arguments only once and then after its execution, we call it four times with the meal expenses (“extra”).",

    "text": "Modules\n\n.py files are called “modules.”\nA directory with .py files in which one of the files is an “__init__.py” is called a package.\nMisc\n\nResource: Make your Python life easier by learning how imports find things\nsys.path contains the list of paths where Python is looking for things to import. Your virtual environment and the directory containing your entry point are automatically added to sys.path.\n\nsys.path is a list. Which means you can .append(). Any directory you add there will have its content importable. It’s a useful hack, but use it as a last resort.\n\nWhen using -m flag to run a script, if you pass a package instead of a module, the package must contain a “__main__.py” file for it to work. This __main__.py module will run.\nIf you have scripts in your projects, don’t run them directly. Run them using “-m”, and you can assume everything starts from the root.\n\nExample:\ntop_dir\n├── foo\n│   ├── bar.py\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── blabla.py\n└── blabla.py\n\nRunning python foo/bar.py, “top_dir” is the current working directory, but “foo” is added to the sys.path.\nRunning python -m foo.bar, “top_dir” is the current working directory and added to sys.path.\n\nImports can all start from the root of the project and opened file paths as well.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nProject Structure\n├── main.py\n├── packages\n│  └── __init__.py\n│  └── module_1.py\n│  └── module_2.py\n│  └── module_3.py\n└── └── module_4.py\n\n“__init__.py” contains only 1 line which declares all the functions (or classes?) that are in the modules\n__all__ = [\"func1\", \"func2\"]\n\nIf the module files contained classes with multiple functions, I think you’d just declare the classes and not every function in that class.\n\nIf using classes, each module should only have 1 class.\n\n\nScripts need to include “_main_” in order to used in other scripts\n# test_function.py\ndef function1(): \n    print(\"Hello world\") \nfunction1()\n\n# Define the __main__ script\nif __name__ == '__main__':   \n    # execute only if run as a script\n    function1()\n\nSays if this file is being run non-interactively (i.e. as a script), run this chunk\nAdd else: chunk, then that chunk will be run only if the file is imported as a module\nAllows you to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported\nImporting a module without _main_ in a jupyter notebook results in this\n\n\nLoading\n\nDO NOT USE from &lt;library&gt; import *\n\nThis will import anything and everything from that library and causes several problems:\n\nYou don’t know what is in that package, so you have no idea what you just imported, or even if what you want is in there.\nYou just filled your local namespace with an unknown quantity of mysterious names, and you don’t know what they will shadow.\nYour editor will have a hard time helping you since it doesn’t know what you imported.\nYour colleague will hate you because they have no idea what variables come from where.\n\nException: In the shell, it’s handy. Sometimes, you want to import all things in __init__.py and you have “__all__” defined (see above)\n\nFrom the working directory, it’s like importing from a library: from file1 import function1\nFrom a subdirectory, from subdirectory.file1 import function1\nFrom a directory outside the project, add the module to sys.path before importing it\nimport sys\nsys.path.append('/User/moduleDirectory')\n\nWhen a module is imported, it first searches for built-in modules, then the paths listed in sys.path\nThis appends the new path to the end of the sys.path\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(1, '/User/moduleDirectory')\nPuts this path at the front of the sys.path directory list.\nimport sys\nsys.path.remove('/User/NewDirectory')\n\n*delete path from sys.path after you finish*\nPython will also search this path for future projects unless they are removed",

The conditional distribution, \\(P(Y|X_1, \\ldots, X_n)\\) represents the distribution of the response variable, \\(Y\\), given the specific values of the predictor variables, \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\).\n\nEmpirical CDF\n\\[\nF_n (x) = \\frac {1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^n I(X_i \\leq x)\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(X_1, X_2,\\ldots,X_n\\) are from a population with CDF, \\(F_n (x)\\)\nProcess\n\nTake n samples from an unknown distribution. The more samples you take, the closer the empirical distribution will resemble the true distribution.\nSort these samples, and place them on the x-axis.\nStart plotting a ‘step-function’ style line — each time you encounter a datapoint on the x-axis, increase the step by 1/N.\n\nExample\n\n\nThe CDF of a normal distribution (green) and its empirical CDF (blue)\n\n\nJoint Probability Distribution - Assigns a probability value to all possible combinations of values for a set of random variables.\n\nNotation: \\(P(x_1, x_2, ... ,x_n)\\)\nPlugging in a value for each random variable returns a probability for that combination of values\nExample: Two tests for cancer are conducted to determine whether a biopsy should be performed\n\nJoint approach: biopsy anyone who is either at high risk of cancer (test 1) or who was determined to have a probability of cancer past a certain level, based on the marker from the genetic test (test 2)\nCompare with example in Conditional Probability Distributions\n\nIn the context of regression modeling: the joint distribution refers to the distribution of all the variables involved in the regression analysis. For example, if you have a regression model with a response variable \\(Y\\) and predictor variables \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), the joint distribution would describe the combined distribution of \\(Y, X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\).\n\nLocation - Distribution parameter determines the shift of the distribution\n\ne.g. mean, mu, of the normal distribution.\n\nMarginal Probability Distribution - Assigns a probability value to all possible combinations of values for a subset of random variables\n\nNotation: \\(P(x_1)\\)\n\n\\(P(x_1,x_2)\\) is sometimes called the Joint Marginal Probability Distribution\n\nThe marginal distribution, \\(P(Y)\\) where \\(Y\\) is a subset of random variables, is calculated from the joint distribution, \\(P(Y = y, Z = z)\\) where \\(Z\\) is the subset of random variables not in \\(Y\\) .\n\n\\(P(Y) = \\sum_{Z=z} P(Y = y, Z = z)\\)\n\nIf \\(Y\\) is just one variable\n\nSays sum all the joint probabilities for all the combinations of values for the variables in \\(Z\\) while holding \\(Y\\) constant\nRepeat for each value of \\(Y\\) to get this summed probability value\nThe marginal distribution is made up of all these values, one for each value of \\(Y\\) (or combination of values if \\(Y\\) is a subset of variables)\n\n\nWhen the joint probability distribution is in tabular form, one just sums up the probabilities in each row where \\(Y = y\\).\nIn the context of regression modeling, the marginal distribution of \\(Y\\) represents the distribution of \\(Y\\) alone, without considering the specific values of the predictor variables.\n\n\nScale - Distribution parameter; the larger the scale parameter, the more spread out the distribution\n\ne.g. s.d., sigma, \\(\\sigma\\) of the normal distribtution\nRate Parameter: the inverse of the scale parameter (see Gamma distribution)\n\nShape - Distribution parameter that affects the shape of a distribution rather than simply shifting it (as a location parameter does) or stretching/shrinking it (as a scale parameter does).\n\ne.g. “Peakedness” refers to how round the main peak is",

    "text": "A priori - a type of knowledge that can be derived by reason alone\n\nA priori analyses are performed as part of the research planning process.\n\nA posteriori - a type of knowledge that expresses an empirical fact unknowable by reason alone.\n\nSame as post-hoc. Post-Hoc analysis is conducted after the experiment.\n\nbias - see unbiased estimator\nceteris paribus - latin for “all things being equal” or “other things held constant.”\nclosed form - a mathematical expression that uses a finite number of standard operations. It may contain constants, variables, certain well-known operations, and functions, but usually no limit, differentiation, or integration.\nconsistency - Requires that the outcome of the procedure with unlimited data should identify the underlying truth. Usage is restricted to cases where essentially the same procedure can be applied to any number of data items. In complicated applications of statistics, there may be several ways in which the number of data items may grow. For example, records for rainfall within an area might increase in three ways: records for additional time periods; records for additional sites with a fixed area; records for extra sites obtained by extending the size of the area. In such cases, the property of consistency may be limited to one or more of the possible ways a sample size can grow\ndegrees of freedom - When discussed about variable-sample size tradeoff, usually means n-p, where is the number of rows and p is the number of variables. The more variables used in the model the fewer degrees of freedom and therefore less power and precision.\nexchangeability - means we can swap around, or reorder, variables in the sequence without changing their joint distribution.\n\nEvery IID (independent, identically distributed) sequence is exchangeable - but not the other way around. Every exchangeable sequence is identically distributed, though\n\nExample: If you draw a sequence of red and blue marbles from a bag without replacement, the sample is exchangeable but not independent. e.g. drawing a red marble affects the probability of drawing a red or blue marble next.\n\n\nefficiency - A test, estimator, etc. is more efficient than another test, estimator, etc. if it requires fewer observation to obtain the same level of performance.\nergodicity - the idea that a point of a moving system, either a dynamical system or a stochastic process, will eventually visit all parts of the space that the system moves in, in a uniform and random sense\nexternal validity - Our estimates are externally valid if inferences and conclusions can be generalized from the population and setting studied to other populations and settings. (also see internal validity)\nidentifiable (aka point-indentifiable) - theoretically possible to learn the true values of this model’s underlying parameters after obtaining an infinite number of observations from it (see non-identifiability, partially-indentifiable)\nill-conditioned - In SVD decomposition, when there’s a huge difference between largest and smallest eigenvalue of the original matrix, A, the ratio of which is called condition number.\ninternal validity - our estimates are internally valid if statistical inferences about causal effects are valid for the population being studied. (also see external validity)\nintractable - problems for which there exist no efficient algorithms to solve them. Most intractable problems have an algorithm – the same algorithm – that provides a solution, and that algorithm is the brute-force search\nlocality - effects have causes and chains of cause and effect must be unbroken in space and time (not the case in ‘entanglement’)\nmarginalization - The process of eliminating one or more variables from a joint probability distribution or a multivariate statistical model to obtain the distribution or model for a subset of variables. The resulting distribution or model is called a marginal distribution or marginal model. It allows you to focus on the behavior of specific variables while considering the uncertainty associated with others.\n\nFor example, marginalizing over a joint distribution (i.e. many variables) gets you a marginal distribution (i.e. fewer variables). In other words, if you have a joint probability distribution for two variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the marginal distribution of \\(X\\) is obtained by summing or integrating over all possible values of \\(Y\\). Similarly, the marginal distribution of \\(Y\\) is obtained by summing or integrating over all possible values of \\(X\\).\nNotation: \\(P(X) = \\sum_Y P(X,Y) \\;\\text{or}\\; P(X) = \\int P(X,Y)\\;dY\\)\nOnce you have to the marginal distribution, this allows you compute conditional distributions. For example, after obtaining the marginal distribution, \\(P(X,Y)\\), from the joint distribution, \\(P(X,Y,Z)\\), you can compute the conditional distributions, \\(P(X|Y)\\) and \\(P(Y|X)\\).\nThe uncertainty associated with \\(Z\\) is indirectly considered in the sense that the marginal distribution \\(P(X,Y)\\) accounts for all possible values of \\(Z\\) by integrating over them. However, \\(P(X,Y)\\) itself doesn’t provide explicit information about the uncertainty associated with \\(Z\\).\n\nnon-identifiability - the structure of the data and model do not make it possible to estimate the parameter’s value. Multicollinearity is a type of non-identifiability problem. (i.e. two or more parametrizations of the model are observationally equivalent) (see identifiable, partially-indentifiable)\noverdetermined system - In linear regression, when there are more observations than features, n &gt; p\npartial coefficient - The coefficient of a variable in a multivariable regression. In a simple regression, the coefficient of the variable is just called the “regression coefficient.”\npartially-indentifiable (aka set identifiable) - non-identifiable but possible to learn the true values of a certain subset of the model parameters\nrobust - a “robust” estimator in statistics is one that is insensitive to outliers, whereas a “robust” estimator in econometrics is insensitive to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (hyndman)\nsupport (aka range) - the set of values that the random variable can take.\n\nFor discrete random variables, it is the set of all the realizations that have a strictly positive probability of being observed.\nFor continuous random variables, it is the set of all numbers whose probability density is strictly positive.\nSee link for examples\n\nunderspecification - In general, the solution to a problem is underspecified if there are many distinct solutions that solve the problem equivalently.\nAn unbiased estimator is an accurate statistic that’s used to approximate a population parameter.\n\n“Accurate” in this sense means that it’s neither an overestimate nor an underestimate. If an overestimate or underestimate does happen, the mean of the difference is called a “bias.”\n\nWeak Law of Large Numbers (Bernoulli’s theorem) - states that if you have a sample of independent and identically distributed random variables, as the sample size grows larger, the sample mean will tend toward the population mean",

Cloning repos can take many hours.\nBenefits\n\nIt improves the overall performance of your development workflow, allowing you to work more efficiently. This is especially important when working with large organizations and open source projects, where multiple developers are constantly committing changes to the same repository. A faster repository means less time waiting for Git commands such as git clone or git push to finish. It helps to optimize the storage space, as large files are replaced by pointers which take up less space. This can help avoid storage issues, especially when working with remote servers.\n\nMisc\n\nSee How to Improve Performance in Git: The Complete Guide\n\nExplainer, config settings, advanced gc, checkout, and clone commands\n\n\nUse .gitignore\n\nGenerated files, like cache or build files\n\nThey will be modified at each different generation — and there’s no need to keep track of those changes.\n\nThird-party libraries\n\nInstead, aim for a list of the required dependencies (and the correct version) so that everyone can download and install them whenever the repo is cloned.\n\nFor example, with a package.json file for JavaScript projects you can (and should) exclude the /node_modules folder.\n.DS_Store files (which are automatically created by macOS) are another good candidate\n\n\n\nGit LFS\n\nDesigned specifically to handle large file versioning. LFS saves your local repositories from becoming unnecessarily big, preventing you from downloading unnessary data.\n\nGit LFS intercepts any large files and sends them to a separate server, leaving a smaller pointer file in the repository that links to the actual asset on the Git LFS server.\n\nThis is an extension to the standard Git feature set, so you will need to make sure that your code hosting provider supports it (all the popular ones do).\nAlso need to download and install the CLI extension on your machine before installing it in your repository.\nSet-Up\n$ git lfs install\n$ git lfs track \"*.wav\"\n$ git lfs track \"images/*.psd\"\n$ git lfs track \"videos\"\n$ git add .gitattributes\n\nTells Git LFS which file extensions it should manage.\n.gitattributes notes the file names and patterns in this text file and, just like any other change, it should be staged and committed to the repository.\nCan now add files and commit as normal\nList all file extensions being tracked: git lfs track\nList all files being managed: git lfs ls-files\n\n\nDon’t download the version history if you don’t need to\n\ngit clone –depth 1 gitj@github.com:name/repo.git",

The feature used to work, but now, it does not. The feature was definitely known to work 3 weeks ago.\nManual Workflow\n\nMake sure you’re in the current commit that’s bad and start git bisect\ngit bisect start\n1git bisect bad\n2git log --before=\"3 weeks\"\n3git checkout 3348b0\n\n1\n\nThis labels the current commit as bad (i.e. bug is present)\n\n2\n\nThis lists every commit for last 3 weeks\n\n3\n\nSwitch to the commit that’s the version of the project that was 3 weeks ago when supposedly the feature was working. The first commit listed (i.e. top) will be the commit closest to 3 weeks ago — with older commits below it.

This way, you can decide that you want to commit echo.txt against branch-B without having to go through the hassle of (1) move the file outside the repo, (2) checkout the correct branch, and (3) move the file back into the repo.",

Setting a smaller correction value (i.e., correct =.1) seems to help.\n\n{DescTools::CorPolychor}\n{wCorr} - Pearson, Spearman, polyserial, and polychoric correlations, in weighted or unweighted form\n\nTetrachoric - Used for binary variables when those variables are a sort of crude measure of an underlying continuous variable\n\nAlso see StackExchange discussion on the difference between Phi Coefficient and Tetrachoric correlation\nExample of appropriate use case: Suppose there are two judges who judge cakes, say, on some continuous scale, then based on a fixed, perhaps unknown, cutoff, pronounce the cakes as “bad” or “good”. Suppose the latent continuous metric of the two judges has correlation coefficient ρ.\n“the contingency tables are ‘balanced’ row-wise and col-wise, you get good correlation between the two metrics, but the tetrachoric tends to be a bit larger than the phi coefficient. When the cutoffs are somewhat imbalanced, you get slightly worse correlation between the metrics, and the phi appears to ‘shink’ towards zero.”\nThe estimation procedure is two stage ML.\n\nCell frequencies for each pair of items are found. Cells with zero counts are replaced with .5 as a correction for continuity (correct=TRUE).\nThe marginal frequencies are converted to normal theory thresholds and the resulting table for each item pair is converted to the (inferred) latent Pearson correlation that would produce the observed cell frequencies with the observed marginals\n\n{psych::tetrachoric}\n\nThe correlation matrix gets printed, but the correlations can also be extracted with $rho\nCan be sped up considerably by using multiple cores and using the parallel package. The number of cores to use when doing polychoric or tetrachoric may be specified using the options command. (e.g options(\"mc.cores\"=4);)\nsmooth = TRUE - For sets of data with missing data, the matrix will sometimes not be positive definite. Uses a procedure to transform the negative eigenvalues.\nFor relatively small samples with dichotomous data if some cells are empty, or if the resampled matrices are not positive semi-definite, warnings are issued. this leads to serious problems if using multi.cores. The solution seems to be to not use multi.cores (e.g., options(mc.cores =1)\n\nGoodman and Kruskal’s Gamma\n\nA measure of rank correlation, i.e., the similarity of the orderings of the data when ranked by each of the quantities. It measures the strength of association of the cross tabulated data when both variables are measured at the ordinal level.\nFor 2-way contingincy tables (i.e. 2x2 tables)\nIt makes no adjustment for either table size or ties.\nValues range from −1 (100% negative association, or perfect inversion) to +1 (100% positive association, or perfect agreement). A value of zero indicates the absence of association.\n{DescTools::GoodmanKruskalGamma}",

The term ‘survival’ outcome is used to indicate any prognostic or time-to-event outcome, such as death, progression, or recurrence of disease. Such risk estimates for future events can support shared decision making for interventions in high-risk patients, help manage the expectations of patients, or stratify patients by disease severity for inclusion in trials.1 For example, a prediction model for persistent pain after breast cancer surgery might be used to identify high risk patients for intervention studies\nOutcome variable: Time until event occurs\nPackages\n\nCRAN Task View\n{survival}\n{censored} - {tidymodels} for censored and survival modelling\n{quantreg} - Quantile Survival Regression\n{msm} - Multi-State Models\n\nVignette\nSee Multistate Models for Medical Applications\n\nTutorial using a heart transplant dataset\n\nStandard survival models only directly model two states: alive and dead. Multi-state models enable directly modeling disease progression where patients are observed to be in various states of health or disease at random intervals, but for which, except for death, the times of entering or leaving states are unknown.\nMulti-state models easily accommodate interval censored intermediate states while making the usual assumption that death times are known but may be right censored.\n\n{grf} - Generalized Random Forest; Causal forest with time-to-event data\n{partykit} - Conditional inference trees; Model-based recursive partitioning trees; can be used with {survival} to create random survival forests\n\n{bonsai}: tidymodels, partykit conditional trees, forests; successor to treesnip — Model Wrappers for Tree-Based Models\n\n{aorsf} - Optimized software to fit, interpret, and make predictions with oblique random survival forests (ORSFs)\n{{sklearn}} - Random Survival Forests, Survival Support Vector Machine\n{rmstbart} - Prognostic model that directly targets the RMST (See Terms) as a function of baseline covariates.

    "text": "Terms\n\nAverage Hazard With Survival Weight (AH) aka Censoring-Free Incidence Rate (CFIR): Alternative to RMST that’s based on a statistical measure called person-time incidence rate, which factors in the period that patients are potentially tracked in a clinical trial. (See vignette for {survAH} an example and further details)\n\n“If you follow 100 patients for a year — which would be 100 years of person-time — we divide that into the number of times we would observe an event such as a patient’s death or cancer recurrence over that period. We can calculate this for each group of patients in the trial with the effect of lost-to-follow-up being removed.”\n\nPerson-Time Incidence Rate is defined by the ratio of the total number of observed events and the total person-time of exposure.\n\nAH-based tests can be more powerful than the log-rank test and the standard RMST-based tests in detecting delayed treatment effects.\nFormula\n\\[\n\\hat{\\eta}(\\tau) =\\frac{1-\\hat{S}(\\tau)}{\\int_0^\\tau \\hat{S}(t)dt} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[I(T \\le \\tau)]}{\\mathbb{E}[T\\wedge \\tau]}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\hat S(\\tau)\\) is the Kaplan-Meier estimator\nLast Term: The ratio of the expected total number of events we observe by \\(\\tau\\) and the expected total observation time by \\(\\tau\\) when there is no censoring until \\(\\tau\\).\nDifference in AH: \\(\\hat \\eta_1 - \\hat \\eta_0\\)\nRatio of AH: \\(\\frac{\\hat \\eta_1}{\\hat \\eta_0}\\)\n\nLong-Term Average Hazard\n\\[\n\\hat{\\eta}_k(\\tau_1, \\tau_2) = \\frac{\\hat S_k(\\tau_2) + \\hat S_k(\\tau_1)}{\\int_0^{\\tau_2} \\hat{S}(t)dt - \\int_0^{\\tau_1} \\hat{S}(t)dt} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[I(\\tau_1 \\lt T \\le \\tau_2)]}{\\mathbb{E}[T\\wedge \\tau_2] - \\mathbb{E}[T\\wedge \\tau_1]}\n\\]\n\nLast Term: The numerator is the probability of having an event between \\((\\tau_1,\\tau_2)\\), and the denominator is the expected time of being alive between \\((\\tau_1,\\tau_2)\\). \n\nThus, \\(\\eta_k (\\tau_1,\\tau_2)\\) can be interpreted as an average intensity (think rate) of having an event over the time window \\((\\tau_1,\\tau_2)\\).\n\nPaper shows this metric having more power than AH or LT-RMST for delayed treatment effect situations such as immunotherapy trials.\n\n\nCensoring Time (C): Time at which censoring occurs\n\nFor each unit, we observe Survival Time (T) or C: \\(Y = \\min(T, C)\\)\nRight Censoring: occurs when the event has happened after the enrollment (but the time is unknown).\n\nThe patient does not experience the event for the whole duration of the study.\nThe patient withdraws from the study.\nThe patient is lost to follow-up.\n\nLeft Censoring: occurs when the event has happened before the enrollment (but the time is unknown).\n\nCumulative hazard function (aka Cumulative Hazard Rates)\n\nShows the total accumulated risk of an event occurring at time t\nThe area under the hazard function\n\nHazard Rate (aka Risk Score), \\(h(t \\;|\\; X)\\)\n\nThe hazard rate is the probability that a unit with predictors, \\(X\\), will experience an event at time, \\(t\\), given that the unit has survived just before time, \\(t\\).\nThe formula for the Hazard Rate is the Hazard function.\n\nHazard Ratio (aka Relative Risk of an event): Risk of an event given category / risk of an event given by reference category\n\nThe ratio of two instantaneous event rates\nCoefficient of the Cox Proportional Hazards model (e.g. paper)\n\n\n\\(e^\\beta &gt; 1\\) (or \\(\\beta &gt; 0\\)) for an increased risk of event (e.g. death).\n\\(e^\\beta &lt; 1\\) (or \\(\\beta &lt; 0\\)) for a reduced risk of event.\nHR of 2 is equivalent to raising the entire survival curve for a control subject to the second power to get the survival curve for an exposed subject\n\nExample: If a control subject has 5yr survival probability of 0.7 and the exposed:control HR is 2, the exposed subject has a 5yr survival probability of 0.49\nIf the HR is 1/2, the exposed subject has a survival curve that is the square root of the control, so \\(S(5)\\) would be \\(\\sqrt{0.7} = 0.837\\)\n\n\n\nRestricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) - The expected survival duration up to a pre-specified truncation time, \\(\\tau\\). It has direct clinical interpretation, which holds regardless of the survival model used in an analysis. Changes in RMST are often cited as an alternative to hazard ratios in the context of treatment comparisons and in survival regression modeling.\n\nUnlike proportional hazards, the interpretation of change in RMST holds regardless of whether or not a particular survival regression model holds.\nSee Restricted Mean Survival Time for Survival Analysis: A Quick Guide for Clinical Researchers\nStatistical comparisons based on the standard RMST provides lower power than the conventional log-rank test when detecting delayed treatment effects (e.g. immunotherapy trials). (paper)\n\nSolution: Long-Term (aka Windowed) RMST which defines the lower limit of the definite integral at the point where the K-M curves separate, \\(\\eta\\), instead of 0, and keeps the upper limit at \\(\\tau\\).\nAlso see LT-AH\n\n\nStatus indicator, \\(\\delta\\)\n\n\\(\\delta = 1\\), if \\(T \\le C\\) (e.g. unit fails before study ends)\n\nTrue survival time is observed\n\n\\(\\delta = 0\\), if \\(T \\gt C\\) (e.g. unit survives until end of study or has dropped out)\n\nCensoring time is observed\n\n\nSurvival function (aka Survival Rate), \\(S(T \\lt t)\\):\n\nOutputs the probability of a subject surviving (i.e., not experiencing the event) beyond time t\nMonotonically decreasing (i.e. level or decreasing)\nBaseline survival curve illustrates the survival function when all the covariates are set to their median value\n\nSurvival Time (T) (aka Death, Failure Time, Event Time): Time at which the event occurs",

(Formula depends on treatment category, see example below.)\n\nEven though it’s a probability, it actually represents the expected number of events per one unit of time.

    "text": "Diagnostics\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from How to Evaluate Survival Analysis Models\nPackages\n\n{survex} - Explainable Machine Learning in Survival Analysis\n\nFrom Dalex group\n\n\nThe likelihood-ratio test, Wald test, and score logrank statistics are asymptotically equivalent. For large enough N, they will give similar results. For small N, they may differ somewhat. The Likelihood ratio test has better behavior for small sample sizes, so it is generally preferred.\n\nConcordance Index (C-Index, Harrell’s C)\n\nConsider a pair of patients \\((i, j)\\). Intuitively, a higher risk should result in a shorter time to the adverse event. Therefore, if a model predicts a higher risk score for the first patient (\\(\\eta_i \\gt \\eta_j\\)), we also expect a shorter survival time in comparison with the other patient (\\(T_i \\lt T_j\\)).\nEach pair (\\(i, j\\)) that fulfills this expectation (\\(\\eta_i \\gt \\eta_j \\\\: T_i \\lt T_j\\) or \\(\\eta_i \\lt \\eta_j \\\\: T_i \\gt T_j\\)) as concordant pair, and discordant otherwise.\n\nA high number of concordant pairs is an evidence of the quality of the model, as the predicted higher risks correspond to an effectively shorter survival time compared to lower risks\n\nFormula\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC &= \\frac{\\operatorname{Number of Concordant Pairs}}{\\operatorname{Number of Comparable Pairs}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\operatorname{Number of Concordant Pairs}}{\\operatorname{Number of Concordant Pairs} + \\operatorname{Number of Disconcordant Pairs}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nIf both patients \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are censored, we have no information on \\(T_i\\) and \\(T_j\\), hence the pair is discarded.\nIf only one patient is censored, we keep the pair only if the other patient experienced the event prior to the censoring time. Otherwise, we have no information on which patient might have experienced the event first, and the pair is discarded\n\nProgrammatic Formula\n\\[\nC = \\frac{\\sum_{i,j} I(|T_i \\gt T_j) \\cdot I(\\eta_j \\gt \\eta_i) \\cdot \\Delta_j}{\\sum_{i,j} I(T_i \\gt T_j) \\cdot \\Delta_j}\n\\]\n\nWhere the variable \\(\\Delta_j\\) indicates whether \\(T_j\\) has been fully observed (\\(\\Delta_j = 1\\)) or not (\\(\\Delta_j = 0\\)). Therefore, the multiplication by \\(\\Delta_j\\) discards noncomparable pairs, because the smaller survival time is censored (\\(\\Delta_j = 0\\)).\n\nGuidelines\n\n\\(C = 1\\): Perfect concordance between risks and event times.\n\\(C = 0\\): Perfect anti-concordance between risks and event times.\n\\(C = 0.5\\): Random assignment. The model predicts the relationship between risk and survival time as well as a coin toss.\nDesirable values range between 0.5 and 1.\n\nThe closer to 1, the more the model differentiates between early events (higher risk) and later occurrences (lower risk).\n\n\nIssues\n\nThe C-index maintains an implicit dependency on time.\nThe C-index becomes more biased (upwards) the more the amount of censoring (see Uno’s C below)\n\n\nUno’s C\n\n** Preferable to Harrell’s C in the presence of a higher amount of censoring. **\nVariation of Harrell’s C that includes the inverse probability of censoring weighting\n\nWeights based on the estimated censoring cumulative distribution\nUses the Kaplan-Meier estimator for the censoring distribution\n\nSo the disribution of censored units should be independent of the covariate variables\n\nIn the paper, Uno showed through simulation this measure is still pretty robust even when the censoring is dependent on the covariates\n\n\n\n\nDynamic AUC\n\nAUC where the False Positive Rates (FPR) and True Positive Rates (TPR) are time-dependent\n\nSince a unit is a True Negative until the event then becomes a True Positive\nRecommended for tasks when you want to measure performance over a specific period of time (e.g. predicting churn in the first year of subscription).\n\nFormula\n\\[\n\\widehat{AUC}(t) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n I(y_j \\gt t)\\cdot I(y_i \\le t)\\cdot \\hat \\omega_i \\cdot I(\\hat f(\\boldsymbol{x}_j) \\le \\hat f(\\boldsymbol{x}_i))}{(\\sum_{i=1}^n I(y_i \\gt t)) \\;\\cdot\\; (\\sum_{i=1}^n I(y_i \\le t) \\; \\hat \\omega_i)}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\hat f\\) are predicted risk scores\n\\(\\hat \\omega\\) is the inverse probability of censoring weight (see Uno’s C)\n\\(I(y_{i,j} \\gt t)\\) indicates whether the unit pair’s, \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), event time is greater or less the time, \\(t\\).

Setting the timeout in 1-second increments helps ensure you’re not billed for extra time if your function runs slightly longer than expected.\nPrice optimization entails tuning this timeout parameter to be as close to your run time as possible. Need to take into account timeouts of other services included in your lambda function. (Guide)\n\nMonitor your Lambda functions for timeouts using CloudWatch metrics.\n\nDependency limit at 50 MB, can add 512 MB more to a tmp file after function has executed\nSpins down when not in use, so you don’t pay for downtime, but takes 5 or more secs to spin back up\n\nCan ping server from time to time to keep it “warm”\n\nLess tweakable than EC2, if problems occur, less flexible in terms of your team handling it\nThe code you run on AWS Lambda is uploaded as a “Lambda function”. Each function has associated configuration information, such as its name, description, entry point, and resource requirements. The code must be written in a “stateless” style i.e. it should assume there is no affinity to the underlying compute infrastructure. Local file system access, child processes, and similar artifacts may not extend beyond the lifetime of the request, and any persistent state should be stored in Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, or another Internet-available storage service.

Useful so you can make sure the correct packages are installed.\nServerless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis.\n\nA serverless provider allows users to write and deploy code without the hassle of worrying about the underlying infrastructure\nCharged based on their computation and do not have to reserve and pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers, as the service is auto-scaling\ne.g. AWS Lambda (i.e. resources only get spun-up when an event is triggered)\n\nNVIDIA GPU Guide (thread)\n\nRTX 20-series or 30-series GPUs are forbidden from inclusion in data centers\nGeneral Recommendations (Oct 2022)\n\nA100 for model training\nT4 for inference workloads\n\nK80\n\nReleased in 2015, the K80 contained a lot of VRAM for the time (24 GB)\nCame before tensor cores and is relatively weak by today’s standards\nOnly okay for learning purposes\n\nP4\n\nReleased in 2016\nValue came from its low power consumption\nMay find it priced higher than its upgraded version (the T4), so recommended to avoid it\n\nT4\n\nReleased in 2018\nSignificant upgrade for inference workloads compared to the P4\nExtremely low power consumption, tensor cores, and plenty (16GB) of VRAM\nCheap, so if you have an inference workload, recommended to strongly consider a T4\n\nP100\n\nBig improvement for model training workloads over the K80 when released\nLess RAM (16GB) than K80\nWay more compute  than K80\n\nCan see memory savings from using mixed-precision training\n\nNo tensor cores\n\nV100\n\nHuge upgrade over the P100\nSame VRAM as P100 many but more CUDA cores\nIntroduces Tensor Cores\nMore cost-efficient than the P100\n\nA100\n\nnewest data center GPU\nupgraded tensor cores\nmost benchmarks show 3x+ faster training compared to the V100\n80GB VRAM\nPrice tag might be big, but it’s usually worth it over the V100",

These default groups do not configure a log retention period, leaving logs to accumulate indefinitely and increasing CloudWatch costs.\n\nExplicitly configure groups with matching names and a retention policy to maintain a manageable volume of logs.\n\nMemory Optimization - AWS Lambda Power Tuning can help to identify optimizations, albeit with notable initial costs given the underlying use of AWS Step Functions.\n\nLambda charges based on compute time in GB-seconds, where the duration in seconds is measured from when function code executes until it either returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest millisecond. To reduce these times, we desire optimal memory configuration.\n\n\nS3 Lifecycle Configuration\n\nCharged for how much data stored, but also which S3 storage classes are utilized.\n\nStandard (default) class is the most expensive, permitting regular access to objects with high availability and short access times.\nInfrequent Access (IA) classes offer reduced cost for data which requires limited access (usually once per month)\nArchival options via Glacier deliver further cost reductions.\n\nConfiguring the lifecycle allows you to automatically transfer data to different storage classes and thereafter permanently delete it, X and Y days respectively after data creation",

    "section": "Terms",
    "text": "Terms\n\nACID - A database transaction, by definition, must be atomic, consistent, isolated and durable. These are popularly known as ACID properties.  These properties can ensure the concurrent execution of multiple transactions without conflict. Guarantees data validity despite errors and ensure that data does not become corrupt because of a failure of some sort.\n\nCrucial to business use cases that require a high level of data integrity such as transactions happening in banking.\n\nBatch processing - performing an action on data, such as ingesting it or transforming it, at a given time interval.\nBTEQ - Batch Teradata Query (like SQL) is simply a utility and query tool for Teradata which is a relational database system Creating a BTEQ script to load data from a flat-file.\nConcurrency - multiple computations are happening at the same time\nData Dump - A file or a table containing a significant amount of data to be analysed or transferred. A table containing the “data dump” of all customer addresses.\nData Mart - A subset of a data warehouse, created for a very specific business use case. Finance data mart storing all the relevant financial information required by the Accounting team to process their month-end cycles.\nData Integration - Usually, the hardest part of the project, where multiple sources of data are integrated into a singular application/data warehouse. Integrating finance and customer relationship systems integrating into an MS SQL server database.\nData Lake - A repository for all kinds of structured and unstructured data. Mainly based on Hadoop storage technology. Called a lake as it is flexible enough to store anything from raw data to unstructured email files. Hadoop Data Lake. Storing logs of all customers called into the inbound call centre including call duration.\nData Mesh - Decentralized design where data is owned and managed by teams across the organisation that understands it the most, known as domain-driven ownership. tl;dr - Each department controls they’re own data from ingestion to “data products.” This data product is then made a available to the other departments for them to use in their projects. Each department has their own engineers, scientists, and analysts.\n\nEach business unit or domain aims to infuse product thinking to create quality and reusable data products — a self-contained and accessible data set treated as a product by the data’s producers — which can then published and shared across the mesh to consumers in other domains and business units — called nodes on the mesh.\nEnables teams to work independently with greater autonomy and agility, while still ensuring that data is consistent, reliable and well-governed.\nYou don’t have to figure out who’s in charge of what data, who gets to access it, who needs to protect it and what controls and monitoring is in place to ensure things don’t go wrong.\nExample: Banking\n\nCredit risk domain’s own data engineers can independently create and manage their data pipelines, without relying on a centralised ingestion team far removed from the business and lacking in credit expertise. This credit team will take pride in building and refining high-quality, strategic, and reusable data products that can be shared to different nodes (business domains) across the mesh.\n\n\nData Models - A way of organising the data in a way that it can be understood in a real-world scenario. Taking a huge amount of data and logically grouping it into customer, product and location data.\nData Quality - A discipline of measuring the quality of the data to improve and cleanse it. Checking Customer data for completeness, accuracy and validity.\nData Replication - There are multiple ways to do this, but mainly it is a practice of replicating data to multiple servers to protect an organisation against data loss. Replicating the customer information across two databases, to make sure their core details are not lost.\nDenormalization - database optimization technique in which we add redundant data to one or more tables. Designers use it to tune the performance of systems to support time-critical operations. Done in order to avoid costly joins. Me: Seems like it’s kind of like a View except a View might have calculated columns in it.\nDimensions - A data warehousing term for qualitative information. Name of the customer or their country of residence.\nDistributed SQL -  a single logical database deployed across multiple physical nodes in a single data center or across many data centers if need be; all of which allow it to deliver elastic scale and resilience. Billions of transactions can be handled in a globally distributed database.\nEDW - The same as a data warehouse except it includes all the data within an organisation. This means that the entire enterprise can rely on this warehouse for their business decisions. Organising sales, customer, marketing and finance data in an enterprise data warehouse to be able to create several key management reports.\nEmbedded aka In-Process\n\nEmbedded database as in a database system particularly designed for the “embedded” space (mobile devices and so on.) This means they perform reasonably in tight environments (memory/CPU wise.)\nEmbedded database as in databases that do not need a server, and are embedded in an application (like SQLite.) This means everything is managed by the application.\n\nFacts - A data warehousing term for quantitative information. The number of orders placed by a customer.\nFlat File - Commonly used to transfer data due to their basic nature; flat files are a single table storing data in a plain text format. All customer order numbers stored in a comma-separated value (.csv) file\nHTAP - Hybrid Transactional Analytical Processing - System that attempts be good at both OLAP and OLTP\nMaster Data - This is data that is the best representation of a particular entity in the business. This gives you a 360 view of that data entity by generally consolidating multiple data sources. Best customer data representation from multiple sources of information.\nMulti-Master - allows data to be stored by a group of computers, and updated by any member of the group. All members are responsive to client data queries. The multi-master replication system is responsible for propagating the data modifications made by each member to the rest of the group and resolving any conflicts that might arise between concurrent changes made by different members.\n\nAdvantages\n\nAvailability: If one master fails, other masters continue to update the database.\nDistributed Access: Masters can be located in several physical sites, i.e. distributed across the network.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nConsistency: Most multi-master replication systems are only loosely consistent, i.e. lazy and asynchronous, violating ACID properties. (mysql’s multi-master is acid compliant)\nPerformance: Eager replication systems are complex and increase communication latency.\nIntegrity: Issues such as conflict resolution can become intractable as the number of nodes involved rises and latency increases.\n\nCan be contrasted with primary-replica replication, in which a single member of the group is designated as the “master” for a given piece of data and is the only node allowed to modify that data item. Other members wishing to modify the data item must first contact the master node. Allowing only a single master makes it easier to achieve consistency among the members of the group, but is less flexible than multi-master replication.\n\nNiFi - It is an open-source extract, transform and load tool (refer to ETL), this allows filter, integrating and joining data. Moving postcode data from a .csv file to HDFS using NiFi.\nNormalization - A method of organizing the data in a granular enough format that it can be utilised for different purposes over time. Organizing according to data attributes reduces or eliminates data redundancy (i.e. having the same data in multiple places). Usually, this is done by normalizing the data into different forms such as 1NF (normal form) or 3NF (3rd normal form) which is the most common. (See DB, Relational &gt;&gt; Normalization)\n\nTaking customer order data and creating granular information model; order in one table, item ordered in another table, customer contact in another table, payment of the order in another table. This allows for the data to be re-used for different purposes over time.\n\nNULL indexes - These are the indexes that contain a high ratio of NULL values\nObject-Relational Mapping (ORM) - Allows you to define your data models in Python classes, which are then used to create and interact with the database. See {{SQLAlchemy}}\nODS - Operational data store generally stores limited and current information to help simple queries. Unable to handle historical or complex data queries. An ODS for daily stock fluctuations in a warehouse help the warehouse manager decide what to prioritise in the next order delivery.\nOLAP - Online Analytical Processing - large chunks of tables are read to create summaries of the stored data\n\nUse chunked-columnar data representation\n\nOLTP - Online Transactional Processing - rows in tables are created, updated and removed concurrently\n\ntraditionally use a row-based data representation\npostgres excels at this type of processing\n\nRDBMS - Relational database management system. All of the above examples are RDBMS, meaning they store data in a structured format using rows and columns.\n\nA Microsoft SQL server database.\n\nReal-Time Processing (aka Event Streaming) - each new piece of data that is picked up triggers an event, which is streamed through the data pipeline continuously\nReverse ETL - Instead of ETL where data is transformed before it’s stored or ELT where data is stored and transformed while in storage, Reverse ETL performs transformations in the pipeline between Storage and the Data Product.\n\nSCD Type 1–6 - A method to deal with changes in the data over time in a data warehouse. Type 1 is when history is overwritten whereas Type 2 (most common) is when history is maintained each time a change occurs.\n\nWhen a customer changes their address; SCD Type 1 would overwrite the old address with the new one, whereas Type 2 would store both addresses to maintain history.\n\nSchemas - A term for a collection of database objects. These are generally used to logically separate data within the database and apply access controls.\n\nStoring HR data in HR schema allows logical segregation from other data in the organisation.\n\nSharding - Horizontal Partitioning — divides the data horizontally and usually on different database instances, which reduces performance pressure on a single server.\n\nStaging - The name of a storage area that is temporary in nature; to allow for processing of ETL jobs (refer to ETL). Typically data is loaded from a source database into the staging area database where it is transformed. Once transformed, it’s loaded into the production database where analytics can be performed on it.\n\nA staging area in an ETL routine to allow for data to be cleaned before loading into the final tables.\n\nTransactional Data - This is data that describes an actual event.\n\nOrder placed, a delivery arranged, or a delivery accepted.\n\nUnstructured Data - Data that cannot be nicely organised in a tabular format, like images, PDF files etc.\n\nAn image stored on a data lake cannot be retrieved using common data query languages.",

    "text": "Cost Optimization\n\nAlso see\n\npage 53 in notebook\nGoogle, BigQuery &gt;&gt; Optimization\n\nAvoid disk operations, make sure that you look out for hints & information in the EXPLAIN PLAN of your query. (e.g. using SORT without an index)\n\nWhen you see filesort, understand that it will try to fit the whole table in the memory in many chunks.\n\nIf the table is too large to fit in memory, it will create a temporary table on disk.\n\nLook out for a using filesort with or without a combination of using temporary.\n\nLoading data in chunks or streaming it record by record for ETL jobs helps to optimize memory usage.\nSplit tables with many columns Might be efficient to split the less-frequently used data into separate tables with a few columns each, and relate them back to the main table by duplicating the numeric ID column from the main table.\n\nEach small table can have a primary key for fast lookups of its data, and you can query just the set of columns that you need using a join operation.\n\nPrimary keys should be global integers.\n\nIntegers consume less memory than strings, and they are faster to compare and hash\n\nJoins\n\nWith correlated keys\n\nThe query planner won’t recognize the correlated keys and do nested loop join when a hash join is more efficient\nI don’t fully understand what correlated keys on a join are, but see SQL &gt;&gt; Terms &gt;&gt; Correlated/Uncorrelated queries\n\nIn the example below, a group of merge_commit_ids will only be from 1 repository id, so the two keys are associated in a sort of traditional statistical sense.\n\nSolutions\n\nUse LEFT_JOIN instead of INNER_JOIN\nUse extended statistics\nCREATE STATISTICS ids_correlation ON repository_id, merge_commit_id FROM pull_requests;\n\n“repository_id” and “merge_commit_id” are the correlated keys\nI’m not sure if “ids_correlation” is a function or just a user-defined name\nPostgreSQL ≥13 will recognize correlation and the query planner will make the correct calculation and perform a hash join\n\n\n\n\nPre-join data before loading it into storage\n\nIf a group of tables is frequently joined and frequently queried, then pre-joining will reduce query costs\ncan be done using an operational transform system such as Spark, Flow, or Flink (dbt can parallelize runs and work w/Spark)\n\nIndexes{#sec-db-eng-costopt-index}\n\nIndexes help in filtering data faster as the data is stored in a predefined order based on some key columns.\n\nIf the query uses those key columns, the index will be used, and the filter will be faster.\n\nSuitable for any combination of columns that are used in filter, group, order, or join\nMySQL Docs\nDon’t use indexes with LIKE\nCluster a table according to an index\n\nAlso see Google, BigQuery &gt;&gt; Optimization &gt;&gt; Partition and Cluster\nRearranges the rows of a table on the disk\nDoesn’t stay “clustered” if table is updated\n\nSee pg_repack for a solution\n\nExample\n-- create index\nCREATE INDEX pull_requests_repository_id ON pull_requests (repository_id, number)\n-- cluster table\nCLUSTER pull_requests USING pull_requests_repository_id\n\n\nUseful for queries such as\nSELECT *\nFROM pull_requests\nWHERE repository_id IN (...) AND number &gt; 1000\nBest Pactices\n\nAvoid too many indexes\n\nA copy of the indexed column + the primary key is created on disk\nIndexes add to the cost of inserts, updates, and deletes because each index must be updated\nBefore creating an index, see if you can repurpose an existing index to cater to an additional query\nCreate the least possible number of indexes to cover most of your queries (i.e. Covering Indexes).\n\nMakes effective use of the index-only scan feature\nAdd INCLUDE to the create index expression\nExample\n-- query\nSELECT y FROM tab WHERE x = 'key';\n-- covering index, x\nCREATE INDEX tab_x_y ON tab(x) INCLUDE (y);\n-- if the index, x, is unique\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX tab_x_y ON tab(x) INCLUDE (y);\n\ny is called a non-payload column\n\nDon’t add too many non-payload columns to an index. Each one duplicates data from the index’s table and bloat the size of the index.\n\n\nExample: Query with function\n-- query\nSELECT f(x) FROM tab WHERE f(x) &lt; 1;\n-- covering index, x\nCREATE INDEX tab_f_x ON tab (f(x)) INCLUDE (x);\n\nWhere f() can be MEAN, MEDIAN, etc.\n\n\n\nFix unusable indexes\n\nIssues related to data types, collation (i.e. how it’s sorted), character set (how the db encodes characters), etc\nSometimes you can make the indexes work by explicitly forcing the optimizer to use them. (?)\n\nRepurpose or delete stale indexes\n\nIndexes are designed to serve an existing or a future load of queries on the database\nWhen queries change, some indexes originally designed to serve those queries might be completely irrelevant now\nAutomate stale index removal. Dbs keep statistics. Write a script to either notify you or just delete the index if it’s older and not been used past a certain threshold\n\nUse the most cost efficient index type\n\nExample: If your use case only needs a regular expression search, you’re better off having a simple index than a Full Text index.\n\nFull Text indexes occupy much more space and take much more time to update\n\n\nDon’t index huge tables (&gt; 100M rows), partition instead\n\nThen prune the partitions (partition pruning) you don’t need and create indexes for the partitioned tables you do keep.\n\n\nPartitioning\n\nAlso see Google, BigQuery &gt;&gt; Optimization &gt;&gt; Partition and Cluster\nSplits your table into smaller sub-tables under the hood\n\nNot viewable unless you check the table directory to see the multiple files that have been created\n\nThe same goes for indexes on that table.\n\n\nUse on tables with at least 100 million rows (BigQuery recommends &gt; 1 GB) Partitioning helps reduce table size and, in turn, reduces index size, which further speeds up the Data Warehouse (DWH) operations. But, partitioning also introduces complexity in the queries and increases the overhead of managing more data tables, especially backups. So try a few of the other performance techniques before getting to Sharding.\nPartition columns should always be picked based on how you expect to use the data, and not depending on which column would evenly split the data based on size.\n\nExample: partition on county because your analysis or transformations will largely be done by county even though since some counties may be much larger than others and will cause the partitions to be substantially imbalanced.\n\n\nUse ELT (e.g. load data from on-prem server to cloud, then transform) instead of ETL (transform data while on-prem, then load to cloud) for data pipelines\n\nMost of the time you have a lot of joins involved in the transformation step\n\nSQL joins are one of the most resource-intensive commands to run. Joins increase the query’s runtime exponentially as the number of joins increases.\nExample\n\nRunning 100+ pipelines with some pipelines having over 20 joins in a single query.\nEverything facilitated by airflow (see bkmk for code)\nETL: postgres on-prem server, sql queries with joins, tasks ran 12+ hours, then the transformed data is loaded to google storage\n\n13+ hrs for full pipeline completion\n\nELT: running the queries with the joins, etc. with bigquery sql on the data after it’s been loaded into google storage.\n\n6+ hrs for full pipeline completion\n\n\n\n\nUse Materialized Views\n\nA smaller data object that contains the subset of data resulting from a specific query\nWhereas a query happens after data is loaded, a materialized view is a precomputation\nThe computation is done once, and changes to the data are incorporated as they occur, making subsequent updates to the view much cheaper and more efficient than querying the entire database from scratch\n\nFetching a large table will be slower if you try to use multiple cores.\n\nYou have to divide up the table and recombine it. Plus setting up parallel network processes takes time.\nThe time used to fetch some data from the internet depends massively on the internet bandwidth available on your router/network.\n\nUse Random Access via http range header + sparse-hilbert index to optimize db for query searches\nCITEXT extension makes it so you don’t have use lower or upper which are huge hits on performance (at least they are in WHERE expressions) GIN custom indexes for LIKE and ILIKE\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gin;\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;\nCREATE INDEX index_users_on_email_gin ON users USING gin (email gin_trgm_ops);\n\nCREATE EXTENSION adds btree and pg_trgm extensions\nindex_users_on_email_gin is the name of the index\nusers is the table\nUSING gin (email gin_trgm_ops)\n\ngin specifies that it’s a gin index\nemail is the field\ngin_trgm_ops is from the pg_trgm extension. It splits the index into trigrams which is necessary for the gin index to work with LIKE or ILIKE\n\nSlower to update than the standard ones. So you should avoid adding them to a frequently updated table.\n\nGiST indexes are very good for dynamic data and fast if the number of unique words (lexemes) is under 100,000, while GIN indexes will handle 100,000+ lexemes better but are slower to update.\n\n\nNULLS LASTputs the NULLS in a field in any sorting operations at the end\n\nThe default behavior of ORDER BY will put the NULLS first, so if you use LIMIT , you might get back a bunch of NULLS.\nUsing NULLS LAST fixes this behavior but its slow even on an indexed column\n\nExample: ORDER BY email DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 10\n\nInstead use two queries\nSELECT *\nFROM users\nORDER BY email DESC\nWHERE email IS NOT NULL LIMIT 10;\n\nSELECT *\nFROM users\nWHERE email IS NULL LIMIT 10;\n\nThe first one would fetch the sorted non-null values. If the result does not satisfy the LIMIT, another query fetches remaining rows with NULL values.\n\n\nRebuild Null Indexes\nDROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY users_reset_token_ix;\nCREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY users_reset_token_ix ON users(reset_token)\nWHERE reset_token IS NOT NULL;\n\nDrops and rebuilds an index to only include NOT NULL rows\nusers_reset_token_ix is the name of the index\nusers is the table\nI assume “reset_token has to be the field\n\nWrap multiple db update queries into a single transaction\n\nImproves the write performance unless the database update is VERY large.\nA large-scale update performed by a background worker process could potentially timeout web server processes and cause a user-facing app outage\nFor large db updates, add batching\n\nExample: db update has a 100K rows, so update 10K at a time.\nUPDATE messages SET status = 'archived'\n  WHERE id IN\n  (SELECT ID FROM messages ORDER BY ID LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 0);\nUPDATE messages SET status = 'archived'\n  WHERE id IN\n  (SELECT ID FROM messages ORDER BY ID LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 10000);\nUPDATE messages SET status = 'archived'\n  WHERE id IN\n  (SELECT ID FROM messages ORDER BY ID LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 20000);\n\nmessages is the table name\nI guess OFFSET is what’s key here.",

Aggregation queries on it are temporal in nature so any aggregations defined on the data will be changed over time as the data comes.\nIt is append-only data but can have high ingestion rates so needs support for fast writes.\nHistorical trends can be analyzed to forecast future metrics.\n\nRelational databases can’t handle high ingestion rates and near-real-time aggregates without extensions.\nSteaming is the most expensive way to process the data in the majority of cases. Typically batch ingesting into warehouses is free, but streaming may not be.\nUse Cases: anomaly detection and fraud prevention, real-time personalized marketing and internet of things.\nTools:\n\nApache Kafka - Flexible, connects to app servers, other microservices, databases, sensor networks, financial networks, etc. and can feed the data to same types of systems including analytical tools.\n\nUtilizes a publish-subscribe model where producers (i.e. sources) publish data to topics and consumers (e.g. DBs, BI tools, Processing tools) subscribe to specific topics to receive relevant data.\nHighly scalable due to its distributed architecture, allowing data handling across multiple nodes.\nConfluent’s Kafka Connect - Open source and Commerical Connectors\n\nApache Flume - Similar to Kafka but easier to manage, more lightweight, and built to output to storage (but not as flexible as Kafka)\n\nLess scalable as data ingestion is handled by individual agents, limiting horizontal scaling.\nIts lightweight agents and simple configuration make it ideal for log collection\nCan also handle Batch workloads\nAble to perform basic preprocessing, e.g. filtering specific log types or converting timestamps to a standard format\n\nAmazon Kinesis - A managed, commercial alternative to Kafka. Charges based on data throughput and storage. Additional features include data firehose for delivery to data stores and Kinesis analytics for real-time analysis.\nApache Flink - Processes streaming data with lower latency than Spark Streaming, especially at high throughputs. Less likely to duplicate data. Uses SQL. Steeper learning curve given its more advanced features.\nApache Spark Streaming - See Apache, Spark &gt;&gt; Streaming\nGoogle Pub/Sub - Uses Apache Beam programming API to construct processing pipelines\n\nGoogle Dataflow can create processing pipelines using streaming data from Pub/Sub. Developers write their pipelines using Beam’s API, and then Beam translates them into specific instructions for Flink or Spark to execute.\n\n{{temporian}} can interact with Beam to perform various time series preprocessing\n\nIf you have existing workflows around Hadoop or Spark or expertise in those frameworks, then Google Dataproc allows you to reuse that code. It also allows you to used other libraries that aren’t available in Dataflow. Supports various languages like Java, Python, and Scala.\nFor short-lived batch jobs, Dataproc might be more cost-effective. Although, Dataflow’s serverless nature avoids idle resource charges while Dataproc clusters incur costs even when idle.\n\n\nArchitectures\n\nNotes from\n\nData Pipeline Design Patterns\n\nETL\n\n\nKinesis collects data from a server (e.g. app) and continuously feeds it to a lambda function for transformation. Transformed data is deposited into a S3 bucket, queried using Athena, and visualized using Quicksight.\n\nHybrid (Streaming and Batch)\n\n\nKinesis streams data to S3 and when a threshold is reached, a lambda trigger activates a transformation/batch load to the BQ warehouse\n\n\nTimeScale DB\n\nOpen source extension for postgresql\nSupport all things postgresql like relational queries, full SQL support(not SQL-like) as well as the support of real-time queries\nSupports an ingestion of 1.5M+ metrics per second per server\nNear-real-time aggregation of tables\nProvides integration with Kafka, kinesis, etc for data ingestion.\nCan be integrated with any real-time visualization tool such as Graphana\n\nPipeline DB\n\nOpen source extension for postgresql\nSimilar features as TimeScale DB\nEfficiency comes from it not storing raw data\n\nUsually, it’s recommended to store raw data",

    "text": "29.8 Nonviolent Communication (NVC)\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from How to deliver constructive feedback in difficult situations\nOther methods\n\nSBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) Useful for giving better feedback by removing emotions from it and making it clear and concise\n\nSteps\n\nSituation - Start the feedback with a specific situation that occurred which serves as a common reference point and is specific.\nBehavior - Refer to a specific behavior that you observed and want to talk about. Make sure to not give any judgments and leave the interpretation out of it.\nImpact - Talk about the impact that behavior had and what you think and feel about it. Feel free to address what other people think and how it impacted things.\nIntent - Ask about the person’s intention and try to uncover if the person is aware of what he did and why he did it. Then, work together with the person to see how things can be made better and how to overcome issues.\n\n\n\n\nAt the core of NVC is a straightforward communication pattern:\n\n“When ____[observation], I feel ____[emotion] because I’m needing some ____[universal needs]. Would you be able to ____[request]?”\nExamples\n\nTo a co-founder: “When you said, ‘I’m not happy with your work,’ to me in front of the team, I felt embarrassed because it didn’t meet my need for trust and recognition. Please, could we set up a weekly one-on-one session to share feedback in private?”\nTo an investor: “I haven’t received any responses from the last three monthly updates. I’m feeling concerned because I need input. Please, would you mind getting back to me with responses to my questions in the last update?”\nTo a teammate: “You arrived 10 minutes late to the last three team meetings. I am frustrated because, as a team, we have a need for efficiency. Please, could you help me understand what’s happening?”\n\n\nObservations (vs evaluations)\n\nExamples\n\nEvaluation: “You are lazy” (which is a character attack). Observation: “You said that you’d send the document last week, and I haven’t received it.”\nEvaluation: “Your work is sloppy” (which is a criticism). Observation: “Three of the numbers in the report were inaccurate.”\nEvaluation: “You’re always late,” (which is a generalization). Observation: “You arrived 10 minutes late to the meeting this morning.”\nEvaluation: “You ignored me.” (which implies intent). Observation: “I sent you two emails, and I haven’t received a response.”\n\nCheck\n\nask yourself, “What did I actually see or hear?”\n\n\nEmotions (vs thoughts, vs evaluations)\n\nUsing an evaluation or thought instead of an emotion, can result in a defensive reply\nExamples\n\nEmotion: “I feel frustrated.” Thought: “I feel that you aren’t taking this seriously.”\nEvaluation: “I feel judged.” Impact: “I feel resentful.”\n\ndefensive reply: “I didn’t judge you.”\n\nEvaluation: “I feel misunderstood.” Impact: “I feel frustrated.”\nEvaluation: “I feel rejected.” Impact: “I feel hurt.”\n\nCheck\n\nFor thoughs, if you can substitute “I feel” with “I think” and the phrase still works — because it’s a thought, not an emotion.\n\n\nUniversal Need (vs strategy for obtaining a need)\n\nExamples\n\nStrategy: “I need you to copy me into every email.” Universal Need: “I need some transparency.”\nUniversal: ““I need support.” NOT Universal: “I need support from you.”\n\nNOT Universal is more easily interpreted as a veiled accusation and implication that “You aren’t supporting me.”\n\n\n\nRequests (vs demands)\n\nrequests are invitations for another person to meet our needs — but only if it doesn’t conflict with one of their needs.\nCharacteristics of a good request\n\nMake them specific\n\n“I request that you arrive to meetings on time.” instead of “I request that you be more respectful of everyone’s time.”\n\nSay what you want, not what you don’t want\n\nDon’t want: “I request that you don’t dismiss other people’s ideas straightaway”\nWant: “I request that when a team member shares an idea, you ask two or three probing questions before sharing your conclusion.”\n\nStay curious\n\nBe optimistic that everyone’s needs can be met.\nTreat “no” to a request or a defensive reply as an invitation to explore the needs stopping someone from saying “yes.”\nThink about how the other person is feeling and consider what unmet needs may be stopping them from saying “yes.”\n\nAre you feeling hurt because you need some understanding?\nAre you feeling angry because you need your hard work to be recognized?\nIs there more you’d like to say?\n\nSimilarly, if you’re on the receiving end of a request and have to say “no,” state the underlying need that stops you from saying “yes.”\n\n\n\nDiplomatically confirm communication if needed\n\n“Just so we know we’re on the same page, could you play back what I’m asking of you?”\n\n40-word rule\n\nDuring difficult conversations, it’s important to be extremely concise. Aim to describe your observations, feelings, needs, and requests in fewer than 40 words. Using more words suggests you’re justifying your needs, and that decreases their power.\n\nFace-to-Face is better\n\nNVC loses some of its power when it’s in an email.\n\nConsequences should be protective, not punitive\n\nAs a manager, you are responsible for the effectiveness of your team — and every team needs effectiveness. If deadlines continue to be missed (the boundary), you might have to switch their responsibilities or move them on (the consequence). It’s not personal, it’s just what you’ll do to protect your need for effectiveness.",

    "section": "38.6 Orchestration",
    "text": "38.6 Orchestration\n\n38.6.1 Airflow\n\nWebpage\nOpen-source platform for authoring, scheduling, and executing data pipelines.\n\nFeatures for managing and monitoring data pipelines, including integration with various data storage and processing technologies. Similar to the Unix cron utility — you write scripts and schedule them to run every X minutes.\nAirflow can be used for any sort of scheduling task, but is often used for scheduling data modeling. schedule, run and monitor the refresh of our data warehouse\nMonitoring on-prem checking Airflow logs is not user-friendly (better in AWS MWAA)\n\ndifferent types of logs for task, web server, scheduler, worker, and DAGs\nhave to SSH into the server and run commands which becomes more complicated when you want to use distributed servers for scalability.\n\nRequires you to create a central logging storage and make additional setup to make all servers write logs into that single place\n\n\nServer-based remains active even when not running jobs –&gt; continually incurring cost\n\nNo latency since servers are always running\n\nProblems\nLong feedback loop\n\nWhile programming, instant feedback of your DAG becomes crucial when you want a sanity check before your code goes too far.\nTo see the graph view, which is mainly for visualizing dependencies in DAGs, your code needs to be in the folder of an Airflow scheduler that can be picked up. The airflow scheduler also takes time to render and parse your DAG until it shows up.\nMakes debugging difficult during the development cycle, so some engineers write more lines of code and test them all together. If the lines of code become unmanageable on one screen, you might vaguely remember what to validate and what dependencies to check.\n\nDifficult with local development\n\na docker image can be used to inject as much production-related information as possible. But it’s still not 100% copy, and it takes tremendous effort to develop and maintain that docker image.\nEven if you set up dev, staging, and production environments for running Airflow, they aren’t totally isolated and developers can end-up interfering with one another. Services/Extensions Astronomer offers a managed Airflow service.\nAmazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) - managed Airflow service\n\nOrchestrate jobs in EMR, Athena, S3, or Redshift\n\nGlue\n\nAirflow has the glue operator\n\nCloudFormation can be used to configure and manage\n\nallows for autoscaling which saves on costs by scaling down when usage is low\nstill needs a server running even when not running jobs\nmonitoring much easier since all the logs are written into CloudWatch search certain logs using Logs Insights\n\nhave a dashboard that displays usage of server resources like CPU, memory, and network traffic.\nmonitor numerous other Airflow-specific metrics.\nset up alerts and manage notification recipients programmatically.\n\n\nCost factors\n\nInstance size\nAdditional worker instance\nAdditional scheduler instance\nMeta database storage\n\nPotential Issues:\n\nResources are shared on multiple jobs so performance can suffer if:\n\nDon’t distribute trigger times evenly\nMisconfigure your maximum worker count\n\n\nOperate through AWS SDK\n\nCan\n\ncreate, update, and delete MWAA environments and retrieve their environment information that includes logging policies, number of workers, schedulers\nrun Airflow’s internal commands to control DAGs\n\nCan’t\n\nSome of Airflow’s native commands like backfill (check this AWS document), dags list, dags list-runs, dags next-execution, and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38.6.2 AWS Glue\n\nCloud-based data integration service that makes it easy to move data between data stores.\n\nIncludes a data catalog for storing metadata about data sources and targets, as well as a ETL (extract, transform, and load) engine for transforming and moving data.\nIntegrates with other AWS services, such as S3 and Redshift, making it a convenient choice for users of the AWS ecosystem. Serverless (i.e. costs only incurred when triggered by event) Each job triggers separate resources, so if one job overloads resources, it doesn’t affect other jobs\nJobs experience latency since instances have to spin-up and install packages\nCost Charged by Data Processing Unit (DPU) multiplied by usage hours (Pricing)\n\nJob types:\n\nPython shell: you can choose either 0.0625 or 1 DPU.\nApache Spark: you can use 2 to 100 DPUs.\nSpark Streaming: you can use 2 DPUs to 100 DPUs.\n\n\n\nCan run Spark\nExpensive for longer running ETL tasks. So, setting up your own container and deploying it on ECS with Fargate makes sense, both in terms of efficiency and cost.\nMonitoring\n\nCloudwatch\nGlueStudio within Glue Clicking number sends you to Cloudwatch where you can drill down into jobs\nCloudFormation can be used to configure and manage\nGlue SDK available\n\n\n\n\n38.6.3 Prefect\n\nEasier to manage for smaller data engineer teams or a single data engineer\nmore user friendly than Airflow; Better UI; more easily discover location and time of errors\npurely python\nMisc\n\nadd slack webhook for notifications\nHas slack channel to get immediate help with issues or questions\n\nautomatic versioning for every flow, within every project\n\nalso document the models deployed with each version in the README they provide with every flow\n\nComponents\n\nTasks - individual jobs that do one unit of work\n\ne.g. a step that syncs Fivetran data or runs a dbt model\n\nFlows - functions that consist of a bunch of smaller tasks, or units of work, that depend on one another\n\ne.g. 1 flow could be multiple tasks running Fivetran syncs and dbt models\n\nExample:\nfrom prefect import flow, task\n@flow(name=\"Create a Report for Google Trends\")\ndef create_pytrends_report(\n    keyword: str = \"COVID\", start_date: str = \"2020-01-01\", num_countries: int = 10\n):\n\nThese flows are then scheduled and run by whatever types of agents you choose to set up.\n\nSome options include AWS ECS, GCP Vertex, Kubernetes, locally, etc.\n\nDeployments (docs)\n\nAlso see Create Robust Data Pipelines with Prefect, Docker, and GitHub\nDefintions\n\nSpecify the execution environment infrastructure for the flow run\nSpecify how your flow code is stored and retrieved by Prefect agents\nCreate flow runs with custom parameters from the UI\nCreate a schedule to run the flow\n\nSteps\n\nBuild the deployment definition file and optionally upload your flow to the specified remote storage location\nCreate the deployment by applying the deployment definition\n\nSyntax: prefect deployment build [OPTIONS] &lt;path-to-your-flow&gt;:&lt;flow-name&gt;\nExample:\nprefect deployment build src/main.py:create_pytrends_report \\\n  -n google-trends-gh-docker \\\n  -q test\n\nDeployment for the flow create_pytrends_report (see flow example) from the file, “src/main.py”\n-n google-trends-gh-docker specifies the name of the deployment to be google-trends-gh-docker.\n-q test specifies the work queue to be test . A work queue organizes deployments into queues for execution.\nOutput\n\n“create_pytrends_report-deployment.yaml” file and a “.prefectignore” created in the current directory.\n\n“create_pytrends_report-deployment.yaml”:  specifies where a flow’s code is stored and how a flow should be run.\n“.prefectignore”:  prevents certain files or directories from being uploaded to the configured storage location.\n\n\n\n\n\n38.6.4 Azure Data Factory\n\nAllows users to create, schedule, and orchestrate data pipelines for moving and transforming data from various sources to destinations.\nData Factory provides a visual designer for building pipelines, as well as a range of connectors for integrating with various data stores and processing technologies.\nExample: Demand Planning Project\n\n\n\n38.6.5 Mage-AI\n\nEnables users to define DAG regardless of the choice of languages (python/SQL/R)\nWeb-based IDE, so its mobility allows working from different devices, and sharing becomes more straightforward.\n\nUI layout feels like using RStudio. It has many sections divided into different areas.\nOne of the areas is the DAG visualization which provides instant feedback to the user on the task relationship.\n\nDAGs\n\nThe pipeline or DAG is constructed with modular blocks—a block maps to a single file.\nBlock Options\n\nExecution with upstream blocks: this triggers all upstream blocks to get the data ready for the current block to run\nExecute and run tests defined in the current block: this focuses on the current block to perform testing.\nSet block as dynamic: this changes the block type into the dynamic block, and it fits better to create multiple downstream blocks at runtime.\n\nManipulate dependencies via drag and drop\n\nmage-ai keeps track of the UI changes the user made and automatically builds the dependencies DAG into the YAML file. (./pipelines/{your_awesome_pipeline_name}/metadata.yaml)\n\nVisualize data in each block\n\nHelpful for inspecting your input data and further validating the transformation.\nOnce the chart has been created, it will also be attached to the current block as the downstream_blocks.\n\n\nR\n\nAllows users to write the main ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading) blocks using R.\n\n\n\n\n38.6.6 kestra\n\nPopular orchestration libraries such as Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster require modifications to the Python code to use their functionalities. You may need to modify the data science code to add orchestration logic\nKestra, an open-source library, allows you to develop your Python scripts independently and then ​​seamlessly incorporate them into data workflows using YAML files.",

It merely leverages a TSDB.\nBecause Prometheus scrapes values periodically, some Metric types (e.g., Gauges) can lose precision if the Metric value changes more frequently than the scraping interval. This problem does not apply to monotonically increasing metrics (e.g., Counters).\nMetrics can be logged with arbitrary identifiers such that at query time, users can filter Metrics by their identifier value.\nPromQL is flexible – users can compute many different aggregations (basic arithmetic functions) of Metric values over different window sizes, and these parameters can be specified at query time.\n\nMetric values (Docs):\n\nCounter: a cumulative Metric that monotonically increases. Can be used to track the number of predictions served, for example.\nGauge: a Metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily change. Can be used to track current memory usage, for example.\nHistogram: a Metric that categorizes observed numerical values into user-predefined buckets. This has a high server-side cost because the server calculates quantiles at query time.\nSummary: a Metric that tracks a user-predefined quantile over a sliding time window. This has a lower server-side cost because quantiles are configured and tracked at logging time. Also, the Summary Metric doesn’t generally support aggregations in queries.\n\nProcess\n\n\nUsers instrument their application code to log Metric values.\nThose values are scraped and stored in a Prometheus server.\nThe values can be queried using PromQL and exported to a visualization tool like Grafana\n\nThe are R packages that might make querying these metrics easier so you don’t have to learn PromQL",

However, if it returns a character output, knitr will add that output to the document output as-is.\nExample: Chunk Timer\n\nCode\ncreate_timer_hook &lt;- function() {\n  start_time &lt;- NULL\n  function(before, options) {\n    if (before) {\n      start_time &lt;&lt;- Sys.time()\n    } else {\n      stop_time &lt;- Sys.time()\n      elapsed &lt;- difftime(stop_time, start_time, units = \"secs\")\n      paste(\n        \"&lt;div style='font-size: 70%; text-align: right'&gt;\",\n        \"Elapsed time:\", \n        round(elapsed, 2), \n        \"secs\",\n        \"&lt;/div&gt;\"\n      )\n    }\n  }\n}\nknitr::knit_hooks$set(timer = create_timer_hook())\n\nThe hook is triggered the first time (with before = TRUE) to record the system time somewhere (e.g., in a variable called start_time). Then, when the hook is triggered the second time (with before = FALSE), it records the system time again (e.g., as stop_time), and computes the difference in time.\n\nUse in a cell\n```{r}\n#| timer: true\nrunif(10000)\n```\nOutput",

Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms typically drop the complexity of a lookup to O(log(n)).\nMisc\n\nAlso see Maximum inner product search using nearest neighbor search algorithms\n\nIt shows a preprocessing transformation that is performed before kNN to make it more efficient\nIt might already be implemented in ANN algorithms\n\n\nCommonly used in Recommendation algs to cluster user-item embeddings at the end. Also, any NLP task where you need to do a similarity search of one character embedding to other character embeddings.\nGenerally uses one of two main categories of hashing methods: either data-independent methods, such as locality-sensitive hashing (LSH); or data-dependent methods, such as Locality-preserving hashing (LPH)\nLocality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)\n\nHashes similar input items into the same “buckets” with high probability.\nThe number of buckets is much smaller than the universe of possible input items\nHash collisions are maximized, not minimized, where a collision is where two distinct data points have the same hash.\n\nSpotify’s Annoy\n\nUses a type of LSH, Random Projections Method (RPM) (article didn’t explain this well)\nL RPM hashing functions are chosen. Each data point, p, gets hashed into buckets in each of the L hashing tables. When a new data point, q, is “queried,” it gets hash into buckets like p did. All the hashes in the same buckets of p are pulled and the hashes within a certain threshold, c*R, are considered nearest neighbors.\n\nWiki article on LSH and RPM clears it up a little, but I’d probably have to go to Spotify’s paper to totally make sense of this.\n\nAlso the Spotify alg might bring trees/forests into this somehow\n\nFacebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS)\n\nHierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs (HNSW)\nHNSW has a polylogarithmic time complexity (O(logN))\nTwo approximations available Embeddings are clustered and centroids are calculated.

Clusters are defined sequentially so depending on which group of core points the algorithm starts with and hyperparameter values, some non-core points that are within the eps area of multiple clusters may be assigned to different clusters on different runs of the algorithm.",

    "text": "Distributed Architectures\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from An Overview of Distributed PostgreSQL Architectures\nFeatures to achieve single node availability, durability, and performance - Replication - Place copies of data on different machines - Distribution - Place partitions of data on different machines - Decentralization - Place different DBMS activities on different machines\nIf transactions take on average 20ms, then a single (interactive) session can only do 50 transactions per second. You then need a lot of concurrent sessions to actually achieve high throughput. Having many sessions is not always practical from the application point-of-view, and each session uses significant resources like memory on the database server. Most PostgreSQL set ups limit the maximum number of sessions in the hundreds or low thousands, which puts a hard limit on achievable transaction throughput when network latency is involved.\n\nNetwork-Attached Block Storage (e.g. EBS)\n\n\nCommon technique in cloud-based architectures\nDatabase server typically runs in a virtual machine in a Hypervisor, which exposes a block device to the VM. Any reads and writes to the block device will result in network calls to a block storage API. The block storage service internally replicates the writes to 2-3 storage nodes.\nPros\n\nHigher durability (replication)\nHigher uptime (replace VM, reattach)\nFast backups and replica creation (snapshots)\nDisk is resizable\n\nCons\n\nHigher disk latency (~20μs -&gt; ~1000μs)\nLower IOPS (~1M -&gt; ~10k IOPS)\nCrash recovery on restart takes time\nCost can be high\n\nGuideline: The durability and availability benefits of network-attached storage usually outweigh the performance downsides, but it’s worth keeping in mind that PostgreSQL can be much faster.\n\nRead Replicas\n\n\nThe most common way of using a replica is to set it up as a hot standby that takes over when the primary fails in a high availability set up.\nHelps you scale read throughput when reads are CPU or I/O bottlenecked by load balancing queries across replicas, which achieves linear scalability of reads and also offloads the primary, which speeds up writes!\n\nThe primary usually does not wait for replication when committing a write, which means read replicas are always slightly behind. That can become an issue when your application does a read that, from the user’s perspective, depends on a write that happened earlier.\nFor example, a user clicks “Add to cart”, which adds the item to the shopping cart and immediately sends the user to the shopping cart page. If reading the shopping cart contents happens on the read replica, the shopping cart might then appear empty. Hence, you need to be very careful about which reads use a read replica.\n\nWhen load balancing between different nodes, clients might repeatedly get connected to different replica and see a different state of the database\nPowerful tool for scaling reads, but you should consider whether your workload is really appropriate for it.\nPros\n\nRead throughput scales linearly\nLow latency stale reads if read replica is closer than primary\nLower load on primary\n\nCons\n\nEventual read-your-writes consistency\nNo monotonic read consistency\nPoor cache usage\n\nGuideline: Consider using read replicas when you need &gt;100k reads/sec or observe a CPU bottleneck due to reads, best avoided for dependent transactions and large working sets.\n\nDBMS-Optimized Cloud Storage\n\n\nWhere DBMS is Database Management Software. (e.g. Aurora)\nPostgreSQL is not optimized for this architecture\nWhile the theory behind DBMS-optimized storage is sound. In practice, the performance benefits are often not very pronounced (and can be negative), and the cost can be much higher than regular network-attached block storage. It does offer a greater degree of flexibility to the cloud service provider, for instance in terms of attach/detach times, because storage is controlled in the data plane rather than the hypervisor.\nPros\n\nPotential performance benefits by avoiding page writes from primary\nReplicas can reuse storage, incl. hot standby\nCan do faster reattach, branching than network-attached storage\n\nCons\n\nWrite latency is high by default\nHigh cost / pricing\nPostgreSQL is not designed for it, not OSS\n\nGuideline: Can be beneficial for complex workloads, but important to measure whether price-performance under load is actually better than using a bigger machine.\n\nActive-Active (e.g. BDR)\n\n\nAny node can locally accept writes without coordination with other nodes.\nIt is typically used with replicas in multiple sites, each of which will then see low read and write latency, and can survive failure of other sites.\nActive-active systems do not have a linear history, even at the row level, which makes them very hard to program against.\nPros\n\nVery high read and write availability\nLow read and write latency\nRead throughput scales linearly\n\nCons\n\nEventual read-your-writes consistency\nNo monotonic read consistency\nNo linear history (updates might conflict after commit)\n\nGuideline: Consider only for very simple workloads (e.g. queues) and only if you really need the benefits.\n\nTransparent Sharding (e.g. Citus)\n\n\nTables distributed and/or replicated across multiple primary nodes using a “shard key .”\n\nEach node shows the distributed tables as if they were regular PostgreSQL tables and queries\n\nData are located in “shards” which are regular PostgreSQL tables. Joins and foreign keys that include the shard key can be performed locally.\nScaling out transactional workloads is most effective when queries have a filter on the shard key, such that they can be routed to a single shard group (e.g. single tenant in a multi-tenant app) or compute-heavy analytical queries that can be parallelized across the shards (e.g. time series / IoT).\nWhen loading data, use COPY, instead of INSERT, to avoid waiting for every row.\nPros\n\nScale throughput for reads & writes (CPU & IOPS)\nScale memory for large working sets\nParallelize analytical queries, batch operations\n\nCons\n\nHigh read and write latency\nData model decisions have high impact on performance\nSnapshot isolation concessions\n\nGuideline: Use for multi-tenant apps, otherwise use for large working set (&gt;100GB) or compute heavy queries.\n\nDistributed Key-Value Stores With SQL (e.g. Yugabyte)\n\n\nA bunch of complicated stuff I don’t understand 😅\nTables are stored in the key-value store, with the key being a combination of the table ID and the primary key.\nBetter to use PostgresSQL without this architecture.\nPros\n\nGood read and write availability (shard-level failover)\nSingle table, single key operations scale well\nNo additional data modeling steps or snapshot isolation concessions\n\nCons\n\nMany internal operations incur high latency\nNo local joins in current implementations\nNot actually PostgreSQL, and less mature and optimized\n\nGuideline: Just use PostgreSQL. For simple applications, the availability and scalability benefits can be useful.",

Its predicted value is 10 (based on \\(\\beta^*\\)).\nOur data consists of five observed cases of \\(Y\\) with the values 6, 3, 22, 7, and 12.\nIn step 3, we predicted the values 7, 2, 20, 9, and 13 for these five observed cases (based on \\(\\hat \\beta\\)).\nThe predictive mean matching algorithm selects the closest observed values (typically three cases) to our missing value \\(Y_i\\).

    "text": "What chatGPT is:\n\n“What would a response to this question sound like” machine Researchers build (train) large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 by using a process called “unsupervised learning,” which means the data they use to train the model isn’t specially annotated or labeled. During this process, the model is fed a large body of text (millions of books, websites, articles, poems, transcripts, and other sources) and repeatedly tries to predict the next word in every sequence of words. If the model’s prediction is close to the actual next word, the neural network updates its parameters to reinforce the patterns that led to that prediction.\nConversely, if the prediction is incorrect, the model adjusts its parameters to improve its performance and tries again. This process of trial and error, though a technique called “backpropagation,” allows the model to learn from its mistakes and gradually improve its predictions during the training process. As a result, GPT learns statistical associations between words and related concepts in the data set.\nIn the current wave of GPT models, this core training (now often called “pre-training”) happens only once. After that, people can use the trained neural network in “inference mode,” which lets users feed an input into the trained network and get a result. During inference, the input sequence for the GPT model is always provided by a human, and it’s called a “prompt.” The prompt determines the model’s output, and altering the prompt even slightly can dramatically change what the model produces.Iterative prompting is limited by the size of the model’s “context window” since each prompt is appended onto the previous prompt.  ChatGPT is different from vanilla GPT-3 because it has also been trained on transcripts of conversations written by humans. “We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides—the user and an AI assistant,”\nChatGPT has also been tuned more heavily than GPT-3 using a technique called “reinforcement learning from human feedback,” or RLHF, where human raters ranked ChatGPT’s responses in order of preference, then fed that information back into the model. This has allowed the ChatGPT to produce coherent responses with fewer confabulations than the base model. The prevalence of accurate content in the data set, recognition of factual information in the results by humans, or reinforcement learning guidance from humans that emphasizes certain factual responses.\nTwo major types of falsehoods that LLMs like ChatGPT might produce. The first comes from inaccurate source material in its training data set, such as common misconceptions (e.g., “eating turkey makes you drowsy”). The second arises from making inferences about specific situations that are absent from its training material (data set); this falls under the aforementioned “hallucination” label.\nWhether the GPT model makes a wild guess or not is based on a property that AI researchers call “temperature,” which is often characterized as a “creativity” setting. If the creativity is set high, the model will guess wildly; if it’s set low, it will spit out data deterministically based on its data set. If creativity is set low, “[It] answers ‘I don’t know’ all the time or only reads what is there in the Search results (also sometimes incorrect). What is missing is the tone of voice: it shouldn’t sound so confident in those situations.”\nIn some ways, ChatGPT is a mirror: It gives you back what you feed it. If you feed it falsehoods, it will tend to agree with you and “think” along those lines. That’s why it’s important to start fresh with a new prompt when changing subjects or experiencing unwanted responses.\n“One of the most actively researched approaches for increasing factuality in LLMs is retrieval augmentation—providing external documents to the model to use as sources and supporting context,” said Goodside. With that technique, he explained, researchers hope to teach models to use external search engines like Google, “citing reliable sources in their answers as a human researcher might, and rely less on the unreliable factual knowledge learned during model training.” Bing Chat and Google Bard do this already by roping in searches from the web, and soon, a browser-enabled version of ChatGPT will as well. Additionally, ChatGPT plugins aim to supplement GPT-4’s training data with information it retrieves from external sources, such as the web and purpose-built databases.\nOther things that might help with hallucination include, “a more sophisticated data curation and the linking of the training data with ‘trust’ scores, using a method not unlike PageRank… It would also be possible to fine-tune the model to hedge when it is less confident in the response.” (arstechnica article)\n\nOpenAI models\n\ndavinci (e.g. davinci-003) text-generation models are 10x more expensive than their chat counterparts (e.g. gpt-3.5-turbo)\nFor lower usage in the 1000’s of requests per day range ChatGPT works out cheaper than using open-sourced LLMs deployed to AWS.

    "text": "Framework for developing applications powered by language models; connect a language model to other sources of data; allow a language model to interact with its environment\nImplementation of the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models which demonstrates a prompting technique to allow the model to “reason” (with a chain-of-thoughts) and “act” (by being able to use a tool from a predefined set of tools, such as being able to search the internet). This combination is shown to drastically improve output text quality and give large language models the ability to correctly solve problems.\nMisc\n\nNotes from:\n\nA Gentle Intro to Chaining LLMs, Agents, and utils via LangChain\n\nSee article for workflow for multi-chains\nAlso shows some diagnostic methods that are included in the library\n\n\nAvailable vector stores for document embeddings\n\nAlso see Databases, Vector Databases\n\nSee article for description and link to code for a manual, more controlled parsing of markdown files to get text and code blocks\n\nComponents\n\nDocument loader: Facilitate the data loading from various sources, including CSV files, SQL databases, and public datasets like Wikipedia.\nAgent: Use the language model as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order. It repeats through a continuous cycle of thought-action-observation until the task is completed.\nChain: Different from agents, they consist of predetermined sequences of actions, which are hard coded. It addresses complex and well-defined tasks by guiding multiple tools with high-level directions.\nMemory: Currently the beta version supports accessing windows of past messages, this provides the application with a conversational interface\n\nIn general, chains are what you get by sequentially connecting one or more large language models (LLMs) in a logical way.\nChains can be built using LLMs or “Agents”.\n\nAgents provide the ability to answer questions that require recent or specialty information the LLM hasn’t been trained on.\n\ne.g. “What will the weather be like tomorrow?”\nAn agent has access to an LLM and a suite of tools for example Google Search, Python REPL, math calculator, weather APIs, etc. (list of supported agents)\nLLMs will use tools to interact with Agents (list of tools)\n\nTool process\n\nUses a LLMChain for building the API URL based on our input instructions and makes the API call.\nUpon receiving the response, it uses another LLMChain that summarizes the response to get the answer to our original question.\n\n\nReAct (Reason + Act) is a popular agent that picks the most usable tool (from a list of tools), based on what the input query is.\n\nOutput Components: observation, a thought, or it takes an action. This is mainly due to the ReAct framework and the associated prompt that the agent is using (See example with ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION)\n\nserpapi is useful for answering questions about current events.\n\n\nChains can be simple (i.e. Generic) or specialized (i.e. Utility).\n\nGeneric — A single LLM is the simplest chain. It takes an input prompt and the name of the LLM and then uses the LLM for text generation (i.e. output for the prompt).\n\nGeneric chains are more often used as building blocks for Utility chains\n\nUtility — These are specialized chains, comprised of many LLMs to help solve a specific task. For example,\n\nLangChain supports some end-to-end chains (such as AnalyzeDocumentChain for summarization, QnA, etc) and some specific ones (such as GraphQnAChain for creating, querying, and saving graphs). Programme Aided Language Model reads complex math problems (described in natural language) and generates programs (for solving the math problem) as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter.\n2-Chain Examples\n\nChain 1 is used to clean the prompt (remove extra whitespaces, shorten prompt, etc) and chain 2 is used to call an LLM with this clean prompt. (link)\nChain 1 is used to generate a synopsis for a play and chain is used to write a review based on this synopsis. (link)\n\n\n\nDocument Loaders (docs)- various helper functions that take various formats and types of data and produce a document output\n\nFormats like like markdown, word docs, text, PowerPoint, images, HTML, PDF, csvs, AsciiDoc (adoc), etc.\nExamples\n\nGitLoader function clones the repository and load relevant files as documents\nYoutubeLoader - gets subtitles from videos\nDataFrameLoader - converts text columns in panda dfs to documents\n\nAlso, tons of other functions for googledrive or dbs like bigquery, duckdb or cloud storage like s3 or confluence or email or discord, etc.\n\nText Spitters (Docs) - After loading the documents, they’re usually fed to text splitter to create chunks of text due to LLM context constraints. The chunks of text can then be transformed into embeddings.\n\nFrom “Sales and Support Chatbot” article in example below\n\n\n# Define text chunk strategy\nsplitter = CharacterTextSplitter(\n  chunk_size=2000,\n  chunk_overlap=50,\n  separator=\" \"\n)\n# GDS guides\ngds_loader = GitLoader(\n    clone_url=\"https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science\",\n    repo_path=\"./repos/gds/\",\n    branch=\"master\",\n    file_filter=lambda file_path: file_path.endswith(\".adoc\")\n    and \"pages\" in file_path,\n)\ngds_data = gds_loader.load()\n# Split documents into chunks\ngds_data_split = splitter.split_documents(gds_data)\nprint(len(gds_data_split)) #771\n\nEmbeddings\n\nOpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 model is easy to work with, achieves the highest performance out of all of OpenAI’s embedding models (on the BEIR benchmark), and is also the cheapest ($0.0004/1K tokens).\nHuggingFace’s sentence-transformers , which reportedly has better performance than OpenAI’s embeddings, but that involves downloading the model and running it on your own server.\n\nExample: Generic\n\nBuild Prompt\n\n\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"product\"],\n    template=\"What is a good name for a company that makes [{product}]{style='color: #990000'}?\",\n)\nprint(prompt.format(product=\"podcast player\"))\n# OUTPUT\n# What is a good name for a company that makes podcast player?\n\nIf using multiple variables, then you need, e.g. print(prompt.format(product=\"podcast player\", audience=\"children”), to get the updated prompt.\nCreate LLMChain instance and run\n\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nllm = OpenAI(\n          model_name=\"text-davinci-003\", # default model\n          temperature=0.9) #temperature dictates how whacky the output should be\nllmchain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\nllmchain.run(\"podcast player\")\n\nIf you had more than one input_variables, then you won’t be able to use run. Instead, you’ll have to pass all the variables as a dict.\n\ne.g., LLMchain({“product”: “podcast player”, “audience”: “children”}).\n\nUsing the less expensive chat models: chatopenai = ChatOpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\nExample: Multiple Chains and Multiple Input Variables\n\nGoal: create an age-appropriate gift generator\nChain 1: Find age\n\n\n# Chain1 - solve math problem, get the age\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentType\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\ntools = load_tools([\"pal-math\"], llm=llm)\nagent = initialize_agent(tools,\n                        llm,\n                        agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\n                        verbose=True)\n\npal-math is a math-solving tool\nReact agent uses the tool to answer the age problem\nChain 2: Recommend a gift\n\ntemplate = \"\"\"You are a gift recommender.

    "text": "Definition\n\nAsking the right question\n“Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts to LLMs for a wide variety of applications and research topics. Prompts are short pieces of text that are used to guide the LM’s output. They can be used to specify the task that the LM is supposed to accomplish, provide additional information that the LM needs to complete the task, or simply make the task easier for the LM to understand.”\n\nComponents\n\nAsk the question (e.g. “What’s 1+1?”)\nSpecify the type of response you want. (e.g. Only return the numeric answer.)\n\nPersona\n\n“Explain this to my like I’m a fifth grader.”\n\nStyle\n\n“Use a style typical of scientific abstracts to write this.”\n\nFormat\n\nIf you say “Format the output as a JSON object with the fields: x, y, z” you can get better results and easily do error handling.\n\n\n\nLLMs don’t understand the complexities or nuances of various subjects\n\nIf an industry term is used in multiple ways, the LLM might not understand the meaning just by context alone.\nLLMs can have problems with information in complex formats.\n\nTables sometimes have this same issue, because tables are the mechanism used for layout structure and not a content structure (e.g. sentence)\n\nThe models themselves continue to evolve so if it doesn’t understand something today doesn’t mean that it won’t understand it tomorrow\n\nWhen the output is incomplete, type “continue” for the next prompt and it will finish the output.\nDon’t give LLMs proprietary data\n\nAlternative: slice(0)\ndat |&gt;\n  slice(0) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nGives the column names and classes\nDepending on the use case, you might want to make the column names unabbreviated and meaningful.\n\n\nSecurity\n\nDon’t let the user have the last word: When taking a user’s prompt, incorporating it with your own prompt, and sending it to ChatGPT or some other similar application, always add a line like “If user input doesn’t make sense for doing xyz, ask them to repeat the request” after the user’s input. This will stop the majority of prompt injections.\nDon’t just automatically run code or logic that is output from a LLM\n\nTips when used for writing\n\nBe specific on word count and put higher than you need\nDon’t be afraid to ask it to add more information or expand on a particular point\\\nIt’s better at creating outlines rather than full pieces of content.\nBe as specific as possible, and use keywords to help ChatGPT understand what you are looking for\nYou can ask it to rephrase its response\nAvoid using complex language or convoluted sentence structures\n**Review the content for accuracy",

    "text": "Templates\n\nMisc\n\nSpecify language, libraries, and functions\n\nExample: BizSci Lab 82\n\n\nShow the prompt he used in a markdown file. He just copied and pasted it into the prompt.\nSpecify libraries to use; models to use; that you want to tune the models in parallel\nThis is not an ideal prompt. You should iterate prompts and guide gpt through complete ds process\n\ni.e. prompt for collection then a prompt for cleaning, and so on with eda, preprocessing, modelling, cv, model selection, app\nUse the phrases like:\n\n“Please update code to include &lt;new feature&gt;”\n“Please update feature to be &lt;new thing&gt; instead of &lt;old thing&gt;”\n\n\n\nExample: Various DS Activities\n\nExample: Student Feedback\n\nFrom Now is the time for grimoires\nComponents\n\nRole: Tell the AI who it is. Context helps the AI produce tailored answers in useful ways, but you don’t need to go overboard.\nGoal: Tell the AI what you want it to do.\nStep-by-Step Instructions: Research has found that it often works best to give the AI explicit instructions that go step-by-step through what you want.\n\nOne approach, called Chain of Thought prompting, gives the AI an example of how you want it to reason before you make your request\nYou can also give it step-by-step directions the way we do in our prompts.\n\nConsider Examples: Few-shot prompting, where you give the AI examples of the kinds of output you want to see, has also proven very effective in research.\nAdd Personalization: Ask the user for information to help tailor the prompt for them.\nAdd Your Own Constraints: The AI often acts in ways that you may not want. Constraints tell it to avoid behaviors that may come up in your testing.\nFinal Step: Check your prompt by trying it out, giving it good, bad, and neutral input. Take the perspective of your users– is the AI helpful? Does the process work? How might the AI be more helpful? Does it need more context? Does it need further constraints? You can continue to tweak the prompt until it works for you and until you feel it will work for your audience.\n\nPrompt",

(Gelman post)\nWeakly informative priors: they allow some implausibly strong relationships but generally bound the lines to possible ranges of the variables. (fig 5.3, pg 131)\nWe want our priors to be skeptical of large differences [in treatment effects], so that we reduce overfitting. Good priors hurt fit to sample but are expected to improve prediction. (pg 337)\nWe don’t formulate priors based on the sample data. We want the prior predictive distribution to live in the plausible outcome space, not fit the sample.\nFor logistic regression and poisson regression, a flat prior in the logit space is not a flat prior in the outcome probability space (pg 336)\nAs long as the priors are vague, minimizing the sum of squared deviations to the regression line is equivalent to finding the posterior mean. pg 200\n“As always in rescaling variables, the goals are to create focal points that you might have prior information about, prior to seeing the actual data values. That way we can assign priors that are not obviously crazy, and in thinking about those priors, we might realize that the model makes no sense. But this is only possible if we think about the relationship between measurements and parameters, and the exercise of rescaling and assigning sensible priors helps us along that path. Even when there are enough data that choice of priors is not crucial, this thought exercise is useful.” pg 258\nComparing the posteriors with the priors",

A little more skeptical of extreme probabilities\n\n\nExample\n\nAlso have ggplot code in Documents &gt;&gt; R &gt;&gt; Code &gt;&gt; Simulations &gt;&gt; sim-prior-predictive-distr.R\nPoisson regression (pg 356)\nIn poisson regression, flat normal priors aren’t priors with high s.d.\n\n# prior predictive distribution\ncurve( dlnorm( x , 3 , 0.5 ) , from=0 , to=100 , n=200 )\n\nSince poisson regression uses a log link, the outcome is log-normal. We’re simulating the effect of a normal prior on a log-normal outcome which is why the simulation code uses dlnorm.\n“number of tools” is the outcome variable\nThe prior with s.d. 10 has almost all the probability density at zero and huge mean\na &lt;- rnorm(1e4,0,10)\nlambda &lt;- exp(a)\nmean(lambda)\n[1] 9.622994e+12\nThis usually doesn’t make sense for a prior\nThe prior with s.d. 0.5 has a mean around 20 and a more spread out probability density which makes much more sense given the literature on the subject.",

Afterwards, they may adjust their opinions and you’ll have a greater consensus.\nProcess\n\nElicit location parameter (e.g. via Trial Roulette) from the expert\n\nTrial Roulette (see paper in Misc for details)\n\nRequires the expert to have sufficient statistical knowledge to be able to place the blocks to form an appropriate distribution\nUser should be aware that distribution output may be inappropriate for sample data\n\nExample: Algorithm may output a Gamma distribution which is inappropriate for percentage data since the upper bound can be greater than one\n\nParameter space is split into subsections (e.g. quantiles)\nUser assigns blocks to each subsection\nExample From MATCH website which was an earlier implementation of {SHELF}\n\nTop chart is a histogram where each cell is a “block” (called “chips” at the bottom). The right panel shows the options for setting the axis ranges and number of bins\nBottom chart evidently estimates distribution parameters from the histogram in the top chart which are your prior’s parameters\n\n\nWith experts with less statistical training, it may be better for you to give them scenarios (e.g. combinations of quantiles of the predictor variables) and have them predict the outcome variable.\n\nCompute the statistics given their answers. Show them the results. Ask them to give an uncertainty range around that statistic.\nExample: From their predictions, you calculate the mean. Then you present them with this average and ask them about their uncertainty?\n\ni.e. What is the range around this value they expect the average to be in?\n\n\nAlso try combinations of methods\nSee paper in Misc for other options\n\nFeedback session\n\nExplain to the expert how you’re interpreting their information. Do they agree with your interpretation? Refine information based on their feedback.\n\nElicit scale and shape parameters (upper and lower bounds)\nFeedback session\nEvaluate distribution\n\n\nEvaluating Expert Distribution(s)\n\nMisc\n\nMight be better to use another measure instead of K-L divergence (see Inspect the distributions visually section below)\n\ne.g Jensen-Shannon Divergence, Population Stability Index (see Production, ML Monitoring for details)\n\n\nCalculate K-L divergence between the expert distribution and the computed posterior using the expert distribution as a prior\n\nSmaller K-L divergence means the 2 distributions are more similar\nLarger K-L divergence means the 2 distributions are more different\n\nCreate a benchmark distribution\n\nShould be a low information distribution as compared to the sample data distribution\ne.g. uniform distribution\n\nCalculate K-L divergence between the benchmark distribution and the computed posterior using the benchmark distribution as the prior\nCalculate ratio of K-L divergences (expert K-L/benchmark K-L)\n\nGreater than 1 is bad. Indicates a “prior data conflict” and it may be better to drop this expert’s distribution\nLess than 1 is good. Potentially an informative prior\n\nInspect the distributions visually (Expert prior distributions and computed posterior from benchmark prior)\n\nK-L divergence penalyzes more certain distributions (i.e. skinny, tall) than less certain distribtutions (fatter, shorter) even if they have the same mean/median and mostly the same information\n\nSo, an expert that is more certain may have a disqualifying ratio of K-L difference while a less certain expert with a very similar distribution has a qualifying ratio.\n\nAfter inspecting the distributions, you may determine that distributions really are too different and the expert is far too certain to keep.\n\n\n\n\nAggregate distributions if you’re eliciting from multiple experts\n\nAverage the distributions (i.e. equal weights for all experts)\nRank experts (e.g. by K-L ratio), weight them, then calculate a weighted average distribution\nUse aggregated distribution(s) as your prior(s)",

Even though using a choropleth is not as bad at the census tract level since all tracts have around 4000 people, the sizes of the tracts can be substantially different which can influence the interpretation. Using circles or bubbles, etc. focuses the user on the size of the symbol and less on the size of the geography polygons.\nExample: Hispanic Counts in San Diego County at the Census Tract Level\n\n\nsan_diego_race_counts &lt;- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  variables = c(\n    Hispanic = \"DP05_0073\",\n    White = \"DP05_0079\",\n    Black = \"DP05_0080\",\n    Asian = \"DP05_0082\"\n  ),\n  state = \"CA\",\n  county = \"San Diego\",\n  geometry = TRUE,\n  year = 2022\n)\n\nsan_diego_hispanic &lt;- \n  filter(\n    san_diego_race_counts, \n    variable == \"Hispanic\"\n  )\n\ncentroids &lt;- st_centroid(san_diego_hispanic)\n\ngrad_symbol &lt;- \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_sf(\n    data = san_diego_hispanic, \n    color = \"black\", \n    fill = \"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_sf(\n    data = centroids, \n    aes(size = estimate),\n    alpha = 0.7, \n    color = \"navy\") + \n  theme_void() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Hispanic population by Census tract\",\n    subtitle = \"2018-2022 ACS, San Diego County, California\",\n    size = \"ACS estimate\") + \n  scale_size_area(max_size = 6)\n\nst_centroid finds the center point of geography polygons which will be the location of the symbols. If you look at the geometry column it will say POINT, which only has a latitude and longitude, instead of POLYGON, which as multiple coordiates.\nscale_size_area scales the size of the circle according to the count value.\n\nmax_size is the maximum diameter of the circle which you’ll want to adjust to be large enough so that you can differentiate the circles but small enough so you have the least amount of overlap between circles in neighboring geographies (although this is probably inevitable).\n\n\n\n\n\nDot Density\n\nUseful to show heterogeneity and mixing between groups versus plotting group facet maps.\nExample: Population by Race in San Diego County\n\nsan_diego_race_dots &lt;- \n  as_dot_density(\n    san_diego_race_counts, # see circle maps example for code\n    value = \"estimate\", # group population\n    values_per_dot = 200,\n    group = \"variable\" # races\n  )\n\ndot_density_map &lt;- \n  ggplot() + \n  annotation_map_tile(type = \"cartolight\", \n                      zoom = 9) + \n  geom_sf(\n    data = san_diego_race_dots, \n    aes(color = variable), \n    size = 0.01) + \n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") + \n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3))) + \n  theme_void() + \n  labs(\n    color = \"Race / ethnicity\",\n    caption = \"2018-2022 ACS | 1 dot = approximately 200 people\")\n\nas_dot_density scatters the dots randomly within a geography. values_per_dotsays each dot is 200 units (e.g. people or households). Without shuffling, ggplot will layer each group’s dots on top of each other.\nannotation_map_tile from {ggspatial} applies a base map layer as a reference for the user. Base maps have land marks and popular features labeled in the geography and surrounding areas to help the user identify the area being shown.",

Uses Super Learner ensembling and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) which they call Targeted Learning.\n\nIgnorability - By randomly assigning treatment, researchers can ensure that the potential outcomes are independent of treatment assignment, so that the average difference in outcomes between the two groups can only be attributable to treatment\n\nEngineering outcome variables using potential adjustment variables does not automatically adjust for those variables in your model\n\nNotes from There Are No Magic Outcome Variables\nExample\n\n\nP is population density\nX is the variable of interest\nGDP and P have been used to create GDP/P\nP influences X and provides a backdoor path to GDP/P, so P must be adjusted for\nEven if P doesn’t influence X, the point is that constructing GDP/P using P doens’t automatically adjust for P\n\n\nRandomized experiments remove all paths from the treatment variable, X\n\n\nAdjusting for Z, B, and C can add precision to measurement of the treatment effect since they are causal to Y, but they aren’t necessary to get an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect.\n\nTable 2 fallacy (Notes from McElreath video, 2022 SR Lecture 6)\n\n\nThe 2nd table presented in a paper is usually a summary of all the effects of a regression. The fallacy is that the coefficient of each variable is treated as causal.\nExample: The effect of HIV on Stroke\n\nThe model is lm(Stroke ~ HIV + Smoke + Age)\n\nOnly the coefficient of the HIV variable should be treated as causal and none of the other adjustment variables (Smoke, Age)\n\nThe effects for Smoke and Age are only partial.\nThere are likely unobserved confounding variables, U, on the effect of Smoking on Stroke (e.g. other lifestyle variables).\n\nSmoke is confounded so it’s causal estimate is biased\nAge is also confounded since Smoke is now a collider and has been conditioned upon. This opens the non-causal path, Age-Smoke-U-Stroke.\n\nAge-Smoke is frontdoor, but the backdoor path, Smoke-U, also becomes a backdoor path for Age once Smoke is conditioned upon. (aka sub-backdoor path)\nSo any open path that contains a backdoor path must also be closed\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\nDon’t include effect estimates of adjustment variables\nExplicitly interpret each effect estimate according to the causal model\n\nSee 2022 SR at the end of Lecture 6 where McElreath breaks down the interpretation of each adjustment variable estimated effect.\n\n\n\nPartial Identification (Handling Unobserved Confounds)\n\nMisc\n\nAlso see\n\nPaper: Hidden yet quantifiable: A lower bound for confounding strength using randomized trials (code)\n\nUsing RCT results and Observational data, this paper proposes a statistical test and a method for determining the lower bound confounder strength.\nIn the context of pharmacuticals, RCT results are evidently often released after FDA approval, but this method can be used in any field where there’s a combination of RCT and observational studies..\n\n\n\nSometimes the confounding paths of a DAG model can be not be resolved.\n\nFor confounders that influence the treatment and outcome, see:\n\nStructural Causal Models &gt;&gt; Bayesian examples\nIf there’s a mediator, see Other Articles &gt;&gt; Frontdoor Adjustment\n\nMeasure proxies for the unobserved confound if it’s not practical/ethical to measure\n\ni.e. If the confound is ability, then test scores, letters of recommendation, etc. could be proxies.\n\nExample: 2022 SR Lecture 10 video, code\n\n\nA: Admitted to Grad School, G: Gender, D: Dept, u: Ability, T1,2,3: 3 Test Scores\n\nAbility is latent variable/unobserved confounder\nTest Scores are proxies for Ability\n\nBoth models are fit simultaneously\nCouldn’t find a way to use {brms} to code this and Kurz didn’t included it in his brms SR book.\n\n\n\nA biased estimate is better than no estimate. It can provide an upper bound\nFind a natural experiment or design one\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nAfter the analyis, you should be able to make the statement, “In order for the confound to be responsible for the entire causal effect, it was have to be .”\n\n\nPackages\n\n{tipr} - Tools for tipping point sensitivity analyses\n{konfound} (vignette): Utilizes a sensitivity analysis approach that extends from dichotomous outcomes and omitted variable sensitivity of previous approaches to continuous outcomes and evaluates both changes in estimates and standard errors.\n\nITCV (Impact Threshold of a Confounding Variable) - Generates statements about the correlation of an omitted, confounding variable with both a predictor of interest and the outcome.

The do-operator changes the graph, closing the backdoors.\nThe do-operator defines a causal relationship, because Pr(Y|do(X)) tells us the expected result of manipulating X on Y, given a causal graph.\n\nWe might say that some variable X is a cause of Y when Pr(Y|do(X)) &gt; Pr(Y|do(not-X)).\n\n(makes more sense to me with a binary outcome, Pr(Y = 1|do(X), but maybe Y as a continuous variable can be defined a subset. …I dunno)\n\n\nThe ordinary conditional probability comparison, Pr(Y|X) &gt; Pr(Y|not-X), is not the same. It does not close the backdoor.\nNote that what the do-operator gives you is not just the direct causal effect. It is the total causal effect through all forward paths.\n\nTo get a direct causal effect, you might have to close more backdoors.\n\nThe do-operator can also be used to derive causal inference strategies even when some backdoors cannot be closed.\n\n\nCounterfactual\n\nassociated action: Imagining - what would be the outcome if the alternative would’ve happened.\nIndividual Causal Effects can be calculated but it requires stronger assumptions and deeper understanding of the causal mechanisms\n\nNeed to research this part further.\nIf the underlying SCM is linear then the ICE = ACE.\n\n\n\nA collider along a path blocks that path. However, conditioning on a collider (or any of its descendants) unblocks that path\n\nWhen a collider is conditioned upon, the change in the association between the two nodes it separates is called collider bias.\n\ne.g. if Z is a collider between X and Y, conditioning upon Z will induce an association between X and Y.\n\n\nA conditioning set, \\(L\\), is the set of nodes we condition on (it can be empty).\nConfounding is the situation where a (possibly unobserved) common cause obscures the causal relationship between two or more variables.\n\nThere is more than one causal path between two nodes.\nA causal effect of X on Y is confounded if  \nCollider bias is a type of confounding. When a collider is controlled for, a second (or more) path opens, and the effect is confounded\n\nX and Y are d-separated by [L if conditioning on all members in [L blocks all paths between the nodes, X and Y.\n\nTool for checking the conditional independencies which are visualized in DAGs.\n\nA descendant is a node connected to a parent node by that parent node’s outgoing arrow.\nFrontdoor Adjustment - In a causal chain with three nodes X→Z→Y, we can estimate the effect of X on Y indirectly by combining two distinct quantities: (Useful for when unobserved confounders prevent direct causal estimation)\n\nThe estimate of the effect of X on Z, P(Z|do(X))\nThe estimate of the effect of Z on Y, P(Y|do(Z), X)\n\nFrontdoor Path - a path that exits a causal variable in a DAG rather than enters it.\n\ne.g. the path that connects a causal variable, X, to an outcome variable, Y, has an arrow that points from X to Y.\n\nMarkov Equivalence - A set of DAGs, each with the same conditional independencies\nMediation Analysis - seeks to identify and explain the mechanism or process that underlies an observed relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable via the inclusion of a third hypothetical variable, known as a mediator variable (z-variable in the DAGs of “pipes” below)\n\nIncluding a mediator and the independent variable in a regression will result in the independent variable not being signficant and the mediator being significant.\n\nModeration Analysis - Like mediation analysis, it allows you to test for the influence of a third variable, Z, on the relationship between variables X and Y, but rather than testing a causal link between these other variables, moderation tests for when or under what conditions an effect occurs.\nA node is a parent of another node if it has an outgoing arrow to that node\nA path from X to Y is a sequence of nodes and edges such that the start and end nodes are X and Y, respectively.\nResidual Confounding occurs when a confounding variable is measured imperfectly or with some error and the adjustment using this imperfect measure does not completely remove the effect of the confounding variable.\n\nExample: Women who smoke during pregnancy have a decreased risk of having a Down syndrome birth.\n\nThis is puzzling, as smoking is not often thought of as a good thing to do. Should we ask women to start smoking during pregnancy?\nIt turns out that there is a relationship between age and smoking during pregnancy, with younger women being more likely to indulge in this bad habit. Younger women are also less likely to give birth to a child with Down syndrome. When you adjust the model relating smoking and Down syndrome for the important covariate of age, then the effect of smoking disappears. But when you make the adjustment using a binary variable (age&lt;35 years, age &gt;=35 years), the protective effect of smoking appears to remain.\n\n\nStructural Causal Models (SCMs) - relate causal and probabilistic statements; each equation is a causal statement\n\n\n\n“:=” is the assignment operator\nX is a direct cause of Y which it influences through the function f( )\n\nwhere f is a statistical model\n\nThe noise variables, ϵX and ϵY, are assumed to be independent.\n\nThere are Stochastic and Deterministic SCMs. Deterministic SCMs presented in article.",

Education has a big impact on your occupation, which in turn has a big impact on your income. You don’t want to control for a mediator if you are interested in the full effect of X on Y! Because a huge part of how X impacts on Y is precisely through the mediation of C, in our case choice of and access to occupation, given a certain level of education. If you ‘control’ for occupation you will be greatly underestimating the importance of education.\n\n\nWhen would you want to only measure the Direct Effect?\n\nExample: Determining the amount of remuneration for discrimination\n\nFrom Simulating confounders, colliders and mediators\nVariables\n\nOutcome: Pay Gap\nTreatment: Gender\n\nIn this case, this variable is actually “gender discrimination in the current workplace in making a pay decision” (for which we use actual, observed Gender as a proxy)\n\nMediators: Occupation and Experience\n\nWhen determining whether a type of descrimination exists, you don’t want to condtion on the mediators, because the effect of gender will be underestimated. So, you’d want the total effect. But here, discrimation is already determined and Gender is now a proxy variable. Under Gender’s new definition, Occupation and Experience might influence the amount of “gender discrimiation,” so they can’t be definitively labelled mediators any more.\nSo if you want to estimate that final “equal pay for equal work” step of the chain then yes it is legitimate to control for occupation and experience.\n\n\nShould always compare a mediation model to a model without mediation\n\nAn unnecessary mediation model will almost certainly be weaker and probably more confusing than the model you would otherwise have.\n\nAverage Causal Mediation Effect (ACME) (aka Indirect Effect)- the expected difference in the potential outcome when the mediator took the value that it would have under the treatment condition as opposed to the control condition, while the treatment status itself is held constant.\n\nIf this isn’t significant, there isn’t a mediation effect\nIt is possible that the ACME takes different values depending on the baseline treatment status.

    "text": "Moderation Analysis\n\n\nMisc\n\nAlso see Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis\n\nLike mediation analysis, it allows you to test for the influence of a third variable, Z (moderator), on the relationship between variables X and Y, but rather than testing a causal link between these other variables, moderation tests for when or under what conditions an effect occurs.\n\nModerators are conceptually different from mediators (“when” (moderator) vs “how/why” (mediator)).\n\nThere can be moderated mediation effect though. (see Mediation Analysis &gt;&gt; Methods &gt;&gt; {mediation})\n\nModerators can stengthen, weaken, or reverse the nature of a relationship.\nSome variables may be a moderator or a mediator depending on your question.\n\nAssumption: assumes that there is little to no measurement error in the moderator variable and that the DV did not CAUSE the moderator.\n\nIf moderator error is likely to be high, researchers should collect multiple indicators of the construct and use SEM to estimate latent variables.\nThe safest ways to make sure your moderator is not caused by your DV are to experimentally manipulate the variable or collect the measurement of your moderator before you introduce your IV.\n\nModeration can be tested by interacting variables of interest (moderator x IV) and plotting the simple slopes of the interaction, if present.\n\nSee Regression, Interactions for simple slopes/effects analysis\nMean center both your moderator and your IV to reduce multicolinearity and make interpretation easier. (“c” in variable names indicates variable was centered)\n\nExample: academic self-efficacy (moderator)(confidence in own’s ability to do well in school) moderates the relationship between task importance (independent variable (IV)) and the amount of test anxiety (outcome) a student feels (Nie, Lau, & Liau, 2011).\n\nStudents with high self-efficacy experience less anxiety on important tests (task importance) than students with low self-efficacy while all students feel relatively low anxiety for less important tests.\nSelf-efficacy (Z) is considered a moderator in this case because it interacts with task importance (X), creating a different effect on test anxiety (Y) at different levels of task importance.\n\nExample: What is the relationship between the number of hours of sleep (X, independent variable (IV)) a graduate student receives and the attention that they pay to this tutorial (Y, outcome) and is this relationship influenced by their consumption of coffee (Z, moderator)\nmod &lt;- lm(Y ~ Xc + Zc + Xc*Zc)\nsummary(mod)\n## Coefficients:\n##            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)   \n## (Intercept) 48.54443    1.17286  41.390  &lt; 2e-16 ***\n## Xc          5.20812    0.34870  14.936  &lt; 2e-16 ***\n## Zc          1.10443    0.15537  7.108 2.08e-10 ***\n## Xc:Zc        0.23384    0.04134  5.656 1.59e-07 ***\n\nSince we have significant interactions in this model, there is no need to interpret the separate main effects of either our IV or our moderator\nPlot the simple slopes (1 SD above and 1 SD below the mean) of the moderating effect\n\n\nFor details on this plot and analysis, see Regression, Interactions &gt;&gt; OLS &gt;&gt; numeric:numeric &gt;&gt; Calculate simple slopes for the IV at 3 representative values for the moderator variable\nInterpretation\n\nThose who drank less coffee (moderator, black line) paid more attention (outcome) with the more sleep (IV) that they got last night but paid less attention overall than average (the red line).\nThose who drank more coffee (moderator, green line) paid more attention (outcome) when they slept more (IV) as well and paid more attention than average.\nThe difference in the slopes for those who drank more or less coffee (moderator) shows that coffee consumption moderates the relationship between hours of sleep and attention paid",

But the data can tell us when a DAG is wrong. **\nMany dynamical systems cannot be usefully represented by DAGs, because they have complex behavior that is sensitive to initial conditions. But these models can still be analyzed and causal interventions designed from them.\nA DAG path means any series of variables you could walk through to get from one variable to another, ignoring the directions of the arrows.\nThe variable, U, in DAGs represents one or more unobserved variables\n\nUsually has circle around the U or is just represented by a dashed line\n\n“Conditioned upon,” “adjusted for,” or “controlled for” is all the same thing\n“a” or “α” is used in bayesian formulas to represent the intercept\nNotation\n\nX is not independent of Y, i.e \nconditional independence: Y is not associated with some variable X, after conditioning on some other variable Z, i.e. \n\nthey are statements of which variables should be associated with one another (or not) in the data.\nthey are statements of which variables become dis-associated when we condition on some other set of variables.\nThere is no other path of influence from X to Y except through Z\n\n\n(Total ) Causal Effect and Direct Causal Effect\n\n\nWeight (W) is the outcome, Height (H) and Sex (S) are explanatory\n(Total) Causal Effect is simply, W ~ S\nDirect Causal Effect shuts the backdoor paths, W ~ S + H\n\nSometimes we want the total causal effect and not the direct causal effect. (e.g. if H is a post-treatment variable, see SR, Ch.6)\n\n\n\n\n\nTestable Implications\n\nDiffering associations between plausible DAGs that are testable through statistical models\nAny DAG may imply that some variables are independent of others under certain conditions.\nNO conditional independencies → NO testable implications\nwww.dagitty.net - Enter DAG and it will give you the Adjustment Set and Testable Implications\nExample\n\nQuestion: What is the causal relationship between Divorce Rate (D), Marriage Rate (M), and Median Age at Marriage (A)\nData:\n\n2 regressions are fit\n\nD ~ α + βM\n\nShows that M is positively correlated with D\n\nD ~ α + βA\n\nShows that A is negatively correlated with D\n\n\n\nPlausible DAGs (note: marriage cannot influence your age… technically)\n\n\n\nA directly influences D\nM directly influences D\nA directly influences M\nReasoning: First, Age can have a direct effect, perhaps because younger people change faster than older people and are therefore more likely to grow incompatible with a partner. Second, it can have an indirect effect by influencing the marriage rate. If people get married earlier, then the marriage rate may rise, because there are more young people. Consider for example if an evil dictator forced everyone to marry at age 65. Since a smaller fraction of the population lives to 65 than to 25, forcing delayed marriage will also reduce the marriage rate. If marriage rate itself has any direct effect on divorce, maybe by making marriage more or less normative, then some of that direct effect could be the indirect effect of age at marriage.\n\n\n\nSimilar to 1 except M does not directly influence D\nReasoning This DAG is plausible even though there’s a correlation between M and D (regression 1). It could be that M derives it’s correlation with D through it’s association with A.\n\nThe direction of influence doesn’t prevent a correlation between M and D\n\n\n\nTestable implications\n\nDAG 1\n\nThe DAG shows all three are associated to each other, i.e. \nIt would be natural to think about measuring correlation and if a pair shows no correlation you could discard the DAG, but it is NOT a good test since there are many ways two variables can show correlation yet not be directly associated. (see reasoning under DAG 2 above and under DAG2 below)\nDAG1 has NO conditional independencies and therefore, NO testable implications\n\nDAG 2\n\nThis DAG also shows all three variables are associated with each other.\nD and M are associated with one another, because A influences them both. They share a cause, and this leads them to be correlated with one another through that cause. But suppose we condition on A. All of the information in M that is relevant to predicting D is in A. So once we’ve conditioned on A, M tells us nothing more about D\nThe testable implication is that D is independent of M, conditional on A, i.e. \n\n(Conditioning on A does not make D independent of M, because M really influences D all by itself in this model.)\n\ni.e A and M are marginally dependent\n\n\n\nOnly difference between both DAGs is the conditional independence in DAG2.\n\nTest\n\nRun a multiple regression D ~ α + βMM + βAA\nIf the effect measured from regression 1 disappears in the multiple regression, then we can discard DAG 1. If the effect remains, then we discard DAG 2.\n\n\nDAGs that are consistent with the data associations (M & N are associated but the causal relationship isn’t known)\n\nwhere U is an unknown variable. Unobserved variables are circled.\n\nAll three DAGs have no conditional independencies and therefore not testable implications\n\nA set of DAGs, each with the same conditional independencies known as a Markov Equivalence\n\nData cannot eliminate any of these DAGS. Domain knowledge must be used to reduce the number of Markov Equivalent DAGs.\n\n\n\n\n“Shutting the backdoor” to potential confounding paths\n\nSection 6.4\nwww.dagitty.net - Enter DAG and it will give you the Adjustment Set and Testable Implications\nRecipe\n\nList all of the paths connecting X (the potential cause of interest) and Y (the outcome).\nClassify each path by whether it is open or closed. A path is open unless it contains a collider.\nClassify each path by whether it is a backdoor path. A backdoor path has an arrow entering X.\nIf there are any backdoor paths that are also open, decide which variable(s) to condition on to close it.\n\nIf you have a choice between two variables where conditioning on either will close a backdoor path and one of them is causal to the outcome variable, then condition on the variable that is causal to the outcome variable. It will add precision to the estimate of the treatment effect.\nAny frontdoor paths that lead to backdoor paths must also be closed (see Misc &gt;&gt; Table 2 fallacy)\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nProblem: We want to measure the causal effect of X –&gt; Y\nPotential confounding paths: XUAC, XUBC\n\nXUAC doesn’t have a collider so a variable needs conditioned on (aka adjusted for)\n\nU is unobserved, so either A or C. C directly influences Y, so it’s more efficient and will “aid in precision.”\n\nXUBC has a collider, B. So, no need to condition on any variable\n\nSolution: Y ~ a + X + C\n\nlibrary(dagitty)\ndag_6.1 &lt;- dagitty( \"dag { \n    U [unobserved]\n    X -&gt; Y\n    X &lt;- U &lt;- A -&gt; C -&gt; Y\n    U -&gt; B &lt;- C\n}\")\nadjustmentSets( dag_6.1 , exposure=\"X\" , outcome=\"Y\" )\n#&gt; { C }\n#&gt; { A }\n\n\nProblem: We want to measure the causal effect of the number of Waffle Houses, W, on Divorce, D.\nPotential confounding paths: WSM, WSA, WSMA (Also WSAM but McElreath on says there are 3. Maybe a combo of same letters is equivalent?)\n\nWSM doesn’t have a collider and therefore either S or M needs conditioned on\nWSA doesn’t have a collider and therefor either S or A needs conditioned on\nWSMA has a collider, M. So that path is blocked\nM is a choice for WSM but it’s a collider so it’s out. S is in both WSM and WSA, so conditioning on it kills two birds.\n\nSolution: D ~ a + W + S\n\nlibrary(dagitty)\ndag_6.2 &lt;- dagitty( \"dag {\n    A -&gt; D\n    A -&gt; M -&gt; D\n    A &lt;- S -&gt; M\n    S -&gt; W -&gt; D\n}\")\nadjustmentSets( dag_6.2 , exposure=\"W\" , outcome=\"D\" )\n#&gt; { A, M }\n#&gt; { S }\n\nEvidently conditioning on A and M is also a solution\n\nConditioning on M does close WSM but would then open WSMA. So, by then conditioning on A which is on a fork (or pipe depending on the path) it closes WSMA.\n\nIn his brms ebook, Kurz fits these regressions and a couple others for comparison. There wasn’t a consensus point estimate for W in the regressions that adjust for S and A + M.\n\nMcElreath mentions, “This DAG is obviously not satisfactory–it assumes there are no unobserved confounds, which is very unlikely for this sort of data.”\nThe inconsistent point estimates are probably do to an omitted variable(s) that is confounding the regression.\n\nConditional independencies:\nimpliedConditionalIndependencies( dag_6.2 )\n#&gt; A _||_ W | S\n#&gt; D _||_ S | A, M, W\n#&gt; M _||_ W | S",

    "text": "Terms\n\nCoefficient of Variation (CV) - aka Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) - aka Dispersion Parameter - Measure of the relative dispersion of data points in a data series around the mean. Usually expressed as a percentage.\n\\[\nCV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\n\\]\n\nWhile most often used to analyze dispersion around the mean, a quartile, quintile, or decile CV can also be used to understand variation around the median or 10th percentile, for example.\nShould only be used with variables that have minimum at zero (e.g. counts, prices) and not interval data (e.g celsius or fahrenheit)\nWhen the mean value is close to zero, the coefficient of variation will approach infinity and is therefore sensitive to small changes in the mean. This is often the case if the values do not originate from a ratio scale.\nA more robust possibility is the quartile coefficient of dispersion, half the interquartile range divided by the average of the quartiles (the midhinge)\n\\[\nCV_q = \\frac{0.5(Q_3 - Q_1)}{0.5(Q_3 + Q_1)}\n\\]\nFor small samples (Normal Distribution)\n\\[\nCV_*= (1 + \\frac{1}{4n}) CV\n\\]\nFor log-normal distribution\n\\[\nCV_{LN} = \\sqrt{e^{\\sigma^2_{ln}} - 1}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\sigma_{ln}\\) is the standard deviation after a \\(\\ln\\) transformation of the data\n\n\nCovariance - Between two random variables is a measure of how correlated are their variations around their respective means\nGrand Mean - The mean of group means\n\nUse Cases\n\nHierarchical Group Comparison: Allows you to see how the average of each group relates to the overall average across all groups.\n\nExample: Imagine you collect data on the growth of various species of plants in different types of soil. Calculating the grand mean for plant height of each species allows you to see if any specific soil type consistently produces taller plants compared to the overall average.\n\nIdentifying Outliers: If the mean of a specific group deviates significantly from the grand mean, it might indicate the presence of outliers in that group.\nANOVA: It provides a baseline against which the individual group means are compared to assess if there are statistically significant differences between them.\n\nIt’s the intercept value when you use Sum-to-Zero (used in ANOVA) or Deviation contrasts (See Regression, Linear &gt;&gt; Contrasts &gt;&gt; Sum-to-Zero, Deviation)\n\nKernel Smoothing - Essence is the simple concept of a local average around a point, x; that is, a weighted average of some observable quantities, those of which closest to x being given the highest weights\nMargin of Error (MoE) - The range of values below and above the sample statistic in a confidence interval.\n\\[\n\\text{MOE}_\\gamma = z_\\gamma \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}}\n\\]\n\nZ-Score with confidence level γ ⨯ Standard Error\nIn general, for small sample sizes (under 30) or when you don’t know the population standard deviation, use a t-score to get the critical value. Otherwise, use a z-score.\n\nSee Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) &gt;&gt; Misc &gt;&gt; Z-Statistic Table for an example\n\nExample: a 95% confidence interval with a 4 percent margin of error means that your statistic will be within 4 percentage points of the real population value 95% of the time.\nExample: a Gallup poll in 2012 (incorrectly) stated that Romney would win the 2012 election with Romney at 49% and Obama at 48%. The stated confidence level was 95% with a margin of error of ± 2. We can conclude that the results were calculated to be accurate to within 2 percentages points 95% of the time.\n\nThe real results from the election were: Obama 51%, Romney 47%. So the Obama result was outside the range of the Gallup poll’s margin of error (2 percent).\n\n48 – 2 = 46 percent\n48 + 2 = 50 percent\n\n\n\nNormalization - Rescales the values into a specified range, typically [0,1].

    "text": "Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)\n\nMisc\n\nWhy would we not always use a non-parametric test so we do not have to bother about testing for normality? The reason is that non-parametric tests are usually less powerful than corresponding parametric tests when the normality assumption holds. Therefore, all else being equal, with a non-parametric test you are less likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is false if the data follows a normal distribution. It is thus preferred to use the parametric version of a statistical test when the assumptions are met.\nIf your statistic value is greater than the critical value, then it’s significant and you reject H0\n\n\nThink in terms of a distribution with statistic values on the x-axis, and greater than the critical value means you’re in the tail (one-sided)\n\nT-Statistic Table\nZ-Statistic Table\n\nExample: 95% CI → α = 100% - 95% = 0.05 → α/2 (1-tail) = 0.025\n\n1 - 0.025 = 0.975 (subtract from 1 because the z-score table cells are for the area left of the critical value\nThe z-score is 1.96 for a 95% CI\n\n\nZ-score comes from adding the row value with the column value that has the cell value of our area (e.g. 0.975) left of the critical value\nIf the area was between 0.97441 and 0.97500, then the z-score would be the row value, 1.9, added to the column value that’s half way between 0.05 and 0.06, which results in a z-score of 1.955\n\n\n\n\nType I Error - False-Positive; occurs if an investigator rejects a null hypothesis that is actually true in the population\n\nThe models perform equally well, but the A/B test still produces a statistically significant result. As a consequence, you may roll out a new model that doesn’t really perform better.\nYou can control the prevalence of this type of error with the p-value threshold. If your p-value threshold is 0.05, then you can expect a Type I error in about 1 in 20 experiments, but if it’s 0.01, then you only expect a Type I error in only about 1 in 100 experiments. The lower your p-value threshold, the fewer Type I errors you can expect.\n\nType II Error - False-Negative; occurs if the investigator fails to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false in the population\n\nThe new model is in fact better, but the A/B test result is not statistically significant.\nYour test is underpowered, and you should either collect more data, choose a more sensitive metric, or test on a population that’s more sensitive to the change.\n\nType S Error (Sign Error): The A/B test shows that the new model is significantly better than the existing model, but in fact the new model is worse, and the test result is just a statistical fluke. This is the worst kind of error, as you may roll out a worse model into production which may hurt the business metrics.\n\n{retrodesign} - Provides tools for working with Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) errors. (Vignette)\n\nType M error (Magnitude Error): The A/B test shows a much bigger performance boost from the new model than it can really provide, so you’ll over-estimate the impact that your new model will have on your business metrics.\n\n{retrodesign} - Provides tools for working with Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) errors. (Vignette)\n\nFalse Positive Rate (FPR)(\\(\\alpha\\)) - ; Probability of a type I error; Pr(measured effect is significant | true effect is “null”)\n\\[\n\\text{FPR} = \\frac{v}{m_0}\n\\]\n\n\\(v\\): Number of times there’s a false positive\n\\(m_0\\): Number of non-significant variables\n\nFalse Discovery Rate (FDR) - Pr(measured effect is null | true effect is significant)\n\n\\[\n\\text{FDR} = \\frac{\\alpha \\pi_0}{\\alpha \\pi_0 + (1-\\beta)(1-\\pi_0)}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) - Type I error rate (False Positive Rate)\n\\(\\beta\\) - Type II error rate (False Negative Rate)\n\\(1-\\beta\\) - Power\n\\(\\pi_0\\) - Count of true null effects\n\\(1−\\pi_0\\) - Count of true non-null effects\n\nPower - 1-β where beta is the Probability of a type II error\nFamily-Wise Error Rate (FWER) - the risk of at least one false positive in a family of S hypotheses.\n\\[\nFWER = \\frac{v}{R}\n\\]\n\n\\(v\\): Number of times there’s a false positive\n\\(R\\): Number of times we claim β ≠ 0\ne.g. Using the same data and variables to fit multiple models with different outcome variables (i.e. different hypotheses)\n\nRomano and Wolf’s Ccorrection\n\nAccounting for the dependence structure of the p-values (or of the individual test statistics) produces more powerful procedures than Bonferroi and Holms. This can be achieved by applying resampling methods, such as bootstrapping and permutations methods.\n\nPermutation tests of regression coefficients can result in rates of Type I error which exceed the nominal size, and so these methods are likely not ideal for such applications\n\nSee Stata docs of the procedure\nPackages\n\n{wildrwolf}: Implements Romano-Wolf multiple-hypothesis-adjusted p-values for objects of type fixest and fixest_multi from the fixest package via a wild cluster bootstrap.",

(see example 3)\nExample 1\n\n\np-value of the point estimate is (always?) 1 which says, “given a null hypothesis =  is true (i.e. the true risk ratio = ),  the probability of seeing data produce this estimate or this estimate with more strength (ie smaller std error) is 100%.”\n\nI.e. the pt est is the estimate most compatible with the data.\nThis pval language is mine. The whole “this data or data more extreme” has never sit right with me. I think this is more correct if my understanding is right.\n\nThe pval for the data in this example is at 0.08 for a H0 of 1. So unlikely, but typically not unlikely enough in order to reject the null hypothesis.\nA pval of 0.08 is identical for a pt est = 1 or pt est = 10.5\nWide base of the curve indicates the estimate is imprecise.

The P-value function is a graph of all possible nested confidence intervals for a given estimate, reflecting all possible levels of confidence between 0% and 100%.",

The larger this coefficient the more cases fluctuate in their outcomes\nExample: Survey data with individual incomes over time\n\nHow the measure is different in a particular year compared to the individual average (e.g., do they have a lower or higher income compared to their normal income).\n\n\nExamples\n\nWhether obtaining more education leads to higher earnings.\nWhether wealthier countries tend to be more democratic than poorer countries\n\n\nFixed Effects or First Difference Estimator (FD)?\n\nTaking the first difference is an alternative to the demeaning step in the FE model\nIf the error terms are homoskedastic with no serial correlation, the fixed effects estimator is more efficient than the first difference estimator.\nIf the error follows a random walk, however, the first difference estimator is more efficient. If T=2, then they are numerically equivalent, and for T &gt; 2, they are not.\n\nIs the panel data balanced?\n\nplm::is.pbalanced(&lt;data&gt;, index = c(\"&lt;id_var&gt;\", \"&lt;time_var&gt;\"))\nBalanced - Has the same number of observations for all groups/units at each time point\nUnbalanced - At least one group/unit is not observed every period\n\ne.g. Have missing values at some time observations for some of the groups/units.\n\nCertain panel data models are only valid for balanced datasets.\n\nFor such models, data will need to be condensed to include only the consecutive periods for which there are observations for all individuals in the cross section.\n\n\nOmitted variable bias\n\nMultiple regression can correct for observable omitted variable bias, however, this cannot account for omitted unobservable factors that differ (e.g. from state to state) \n\nThis refers to doing two multivariable regression models - one for each time period\n\nFE models control for any omitted variables that are constant over time but vary between individuals by explicitly including a separate intercept term for each individual (\\(\\alpha_i\\)) in the regression equation\nYou can difference the outcome and difference predictor variables from period 1 to period 2 in order to remove the effects of unobserved omitted variables that are constant between the time periods\nFrom Kubinec differs regarding omitted variables\n\nAny statistical model should have, as its first requirement, that it match the researcher’s question. Problems of omitted variables are important, but necessarily secondary.\nFixed effects models do not control for omitted variables. What fixed effect models do is isolate one dimension of variance in the model. As a result, any variables that don’t vary on that dimension are by definition removed from the model. This side-effect is trumpeted as the great inferential benefit of fixed effect models, but it has nothing to do with inference. Fixed effects (or their cousin, random effects/hierarchical models) are simply about selecting which part of the panel dataset is most germane to the analysis.",

There is no clear research question that matches this model.\nThe one known use of the model is for difference-in-difference estimation, but only with two time points. Says to read his paper for more details.\n\nIs this what the eor book is describing for unobserved omitted variables? (see above)\n\n\nSlope Value Unreliable\n\nOnly identifiable if there’s a different effect of x on y for each time point/case\n\nI think he’s saying if there is no variation in one of your fixed effects and you fit a two-way model anyways, the calculated effect is unreliable. He says the data looks normal and you wouldn’t recognize what happened necessarily.\n\nWhen this model is unidentifiable, R fixes the problem by deleting the last dummy variable (created by factor(fixed_effect_var)) and spits out the estimate.\n\nThe coefficient estimate for the removed dummy variable shows-up as an NA in the summary\n\n\n\nIt’s best to choose whether within-case or between-case effect is more important and fit the 1-way model.\n\ni.e. It is important to think about which dimension is more relevant, and then go with that dimension.\nAssumptions for a model with just an cases fixed effect\n\nResiduals have mean = 0 (i.e. errors uncorrelated with X)\n\nif violated, then omitted variable bias\n\nX (variable of interest) is i.i.d\n\nwithin-cases, autocorrelation is allowed (e.g. states)\n\nlarge outliers unlikely\nno perfect multicollinearity between variables\n\n\n\nPotential danger of biased effects when treatment is assigned during different periods for each group\n\nExample: group 1 is untreated at periods 1 and 2 and treated at period 3, while group 2 is untreated at period 1 and treated both at periods 2 and 3\nWhen the treatment effect is constant across groups and over time, FE regressions estimate that effect under the standard “common trends” assumption.\n\nRequires that the expectation of the outcome without treatment follow the same evolution over time in every group\n\nEstimates can be severely biased – and may even be incorrectly signed – when treatment effects change over time within treated units (aka hetergeneous treatment effects)\nFundamentally, the main reason TWFE estimates get weird and biased with differently-timed treatments is because of issues with weights—in TWFE settings, treated observations often get negative weights and vice versa\nAccording to Jakiela (2021, 5), negative weights in treated observations are more likely in (1) early adopter countries, since the country-level treatment mean is high, and (2) later years, since the year-level treatment mean is higher.\n\n\nSo, in general, the bias comes from entity variable categories that received the treatment early and the biased weight estimates occur on observations with later time values. This is because of the extreme treatment imbalance during these ranges/intervals, and its effect on the outcome variable.\n\nHaving negative weights on treated observations isn’t necessarily bad! It’s often just a mathematical artefact, and if you have (1) enough never-treated observations and (2) enough pre-treatment data, and if (3) the treatment effects are homogenous across all countries, it won’t be a problem. But if you don’t have enough data, your results will be biased and distorted for later years and for early adopters.\nDiagnostics\n\nDo any treated units get negative weight when calculating βTWFE? Check this by looking at the weights\nCan we reject the hypothesis that the treatment effects are homogenous? Check this by looking at the relationship between Yit and Dit. The slope shouldn’t be different.\n\ntreatment effect homogeneity implies a linear relationship between residualized outcomes and residualized treatment after removing the fixed effects\n\n\nComments\n\nShe states that she’s only looking for linearity between the two sets of residuals, but actually breaks it down further by checking whether the relationship varies by treatment. This whole procedure is computing a partial correlation except instead of the last step of measuring the correlation between the two sets of residuals (e.g. cor.test(treatment_resid, out_resid) and getting the p-value, she looks at an interaction.\nI don’t understand the homogeneity check in 3.2 though. She says that if the linearity relationship varies by treatment then this breaks assumptions for TWFE models. I’ve only looked at her paper and the Chaisemartin paper, and the only assumptions I saw for TWFE models in general was the “common trends” and the “strong exogeneity” assumption. I think this is more likely to be about the “common trends” assumption, and my understanding of that one is that it pertains to the effect across time for a particular group. I’m guessing there’s a connection between those two concepts, but I’m not seeing it.",

When the number of clusters, G, is small, cluster-robust standard errors tend to be too small, sometimes much too small. Hence, the second rule of thumb is considerably less likely to lead to severe over-rejection than the first one. However, because it is conservative, it can lead to loss of power (or, equivalently, confidence intervals that are unnecessarily long).\n\n\nRecommended: Cluster at the treatment level\n\ne.g. If the treatment is assigned by classroom then cluster by classroom\nBut if there’s concern of significant spillover effects, then cluster at a coarser level than the treatment level (e.g. schools)\n\n\nDiagnostics\n\nStatistical testing for the correct level of clustering\n\nHard to tell but I don’t think any of the tests were recommended in the paper\n\nChecking for influential clusters\n\nInfluential Cluster - Estimates change a lot when it’s deleted.\n“In a few extreme cases, there may be a cluster \\(h\\) for which it is impossible to compute \\(β_j^{(h)}\\). If so, then the original estimates should probably not be believed.\n\nThis will happen, for example, when cluster \\(h\\) is the only treated one. Inference is extremely unreliable in that case.”\n\n\nPlacebo Regressions\n\nProcess\n\nAdd a random dummy variable to the model\nfit model check if dummy variable is significant\nrepeat many times\n\nBecause a placebo regressor is artificial, we would expect valid significance tests at level α to reject the null close to α% of the time when the experiment is repeated many times.\nExample:\n\nClustering at levels below state-level leads to rejection rates far greater than α\nUsing a state-level CRVE is important for survey data that samples individuals from multiple states. If we fail to do so, we will find, with probability much higher than α, that nonsense regressors apparently belong in the model.\n\ni.e. placebo regressors are significant &gt; 5% of the time\n\n\nA placebo-regressor experiment should lead to over-rejection whenever both the regressor and the residuals display intra-cluster correlation at a coarser level than the one at which the standard errors are clustered. (e.g. &lt; 5%)\nIf the placebo regressor is clustered at the coarse level, we would expect significance tests based on heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors to over-reject whenever the residuals are clustered at either level. Similarly, we would expect significance tests based on finely-clustered standard errors to over-reject whenever the residuals are clustered at the coarse level.

Near ages of zero, the effective slope is near −0.15, indicating each additional year of Age reduces the value of the link function by about 0.15. At the oldest ages, the effective slopes are settling down to a value near −0.09, indicating each additional year of age in this age group decreases the link function by −0.09.",

    "text": "Explaining Your Model\n\nMisc\n\nFor ML models use feature importance to pick predictors to use for partial dependence plots (with standardized predictors, these can also advise on feature importance) and go back to do descriptive/aggregated statistical explorations (box plots, bars, etc.). Explain what’s happening in the plots, potential reasons why it’s happening, and potential solutions.\n\nTypes\n\nWhen talking to a colleague or regulator you may need to give more technical explanations. In comparison, customers would expect simpler explanations. It is also unlikely that you would need to give a global explanation to a customer. This is because they would typically only be concerned with decisions that affect them personally.\nGlobal: Explain what trends are being captured by the model in general\n\n“Which features are the most important?” or “What relationship does feature X have with the target variable?”\n\nLocal: explain individual model predictions\n\nTypically needed to explain a decision that has resulted from a model prediction\n“Why did we reject this loan application?” or “Why was I given this movie recommendation?”\n\n\nCharacteristics\n\n\nTrue: Include uncertainty in your explanations of your model predictions\nCorrect level: Use the language of your audience instead of DS or statistical terminology\nNo. of Reasons & Significant: Only give the top features that are responsible for a prediction or trend, and those features should be responsible for a substantial contribution\nGeneral: Explain features that are important to large portion of predictions (e.g. feature importance, mean SHAP)\nAbnormal: Explain features that are important to extreme predictions or a representative prediction\n\nMight be a feature that isn’t globally important but important for an individual prediction or an outlier prediction\n\nContrasting: Explain contrasting decisions made by your model\n\n“Why was my application rejected and theirs accepted?”\nUse important features (ranges/levels of those features) that aren’t common to both decisions",

    "text": "Business Presentation\n\nThey’re only interested in the story the data tells and the actions it influences\nPrep\n\nCreate an outline\nSituation-Complication-Resolution Framework\n\nSituation: Facts about the current state.\nComplication: Action is required based on the situation.\nResolution: The action is taken or recommended to solve the complication.\nExample\n\n\nOne minute per slide rule\n\nIf you have a 20-minute presentation, aim for 20 slides with content\n\nTry to stick to 3 bullet points\n\nOr if you need to include more information, structure the slide with some sort of “3” framework\n\nExample: 3 columns\n\n\nEach column has 3 bullets\n\n\n\nFocus audience attention to important words\n\nBold, italics, a different color, or size for words you want to emphasize\n\n\nUse emotional elements as hooks to grab attention before starting the introduction. They generate these emotions but also curiosity about what comes next.\n\nGreed - “this has the potential to double revenue”\nFear - “layoffs may be coming”\nPride - “we can do this!”\nAnger - “It’s the competition’s fault!”\nSympathy - “they’re counting on us to help”\nSurprise - “you won’t believe what we found”\n\nUse meaningful sentences as slide titles.\n\nExamples\n\nInstead of “Sales outlook”, use “Sales outlook is promising in the next 12 months”.\nInstead of “Annual Sales”, use “Sales Up 22% In 2022”\nInstead of “Algorithm Training and Validation” use “Predict Customer Churn with 92% Accuracy”\nInstead of “Q1 Conversation Rates” use “Accounts With Direct Contact are 5x More Likely to Purchase”\nInstead of “Utilizing XGBoost to Classify Accounts” use “Machine Learning Improves Close Rates by 22%”\n\n\nRead (only) slide titles aloud\n\nBy reading just the tile and title only as you start each slide, the audience will be able to process the message much more easily than reading the written words and listening to you simultaneously.\nFor the rest of the slide, do not read the content, especially if you use a lot of bulleted or ordered lists. Reading all of your content can be monotonous\n\nIntroduction:\n\nProblem: “flat 4th quarter sales” and maybe a why? it happened\nGoal: “restore previous year’s growth”\nDescribe the presentation to come: “By analyzing blah blah, we can forecast blah, blah” and maybe a teaser on how it will be solved.\nDesired outcome: “Our goal here today is to leave with a budget, schedule, and brainstorm some potential advertising approaches that might be more successful”\nIf analysis is negative, it’s important to frame the story or somebody else will. Could become an investigation or witchhunt. Include something about the way the forward, so keep the focus positive and about teamwork.\nInclude disclaimers/assumptions but only those that directly pertain to the specific subject matter of the presentation\nLayout Q&A ground rules (questions only after or also during the presentation?)\n\nBody\n\nInterpret all visuals. Don’t let the audience reach their own conclusions.\nBullets\n\nShould only cover key concepts so don’t read\nYour narration should add more\n\nMore context\nMore interpretation\nMore content\nMore feeling\n\n\nPresentation Pattern: Present visual \\(\\rightarrow\\) interpret visual\n\nStart with a visual that illustrates the problem \\(\\rightarrow\\) discuss problem \\(\\rightarrow\\) present hypothesis that explains a cause of the problem\nPresent visual that is evidence for your hypothesis \\(\\rightarrow\\) interpret visual\n\nRepeat\nVisuals act as a chain of evidence\n\nProvide recommendation for a course of action \\(\\rightarrow\\) present visuals or data that support this action\n\ne.g. Historical results from previous instances of taking this action\n\nHow this situation mimics the successful instances\n\nForecasts that support the recommendation\n\nTalk about the uncertainty, consequences of lower and upper bounds\n\nSurvey Data\n\nInvite questions and comments about the data and visuals you shown if you have no recommendations or courses of action\n\nTake notes (yourself or assistent)\nIf you don’t have an answer:\n\n“I don’t have an answer for that offhand but I’ll get back to you after we look into that.”\n“I don’t have the answer to that. I can reanalyze the data and see if they support that idea.”\n\n\n\n\nSatisfying Conclusion\n\nSummarize (especially if a lot was covered)\n\nConsiderations\n\nWhat does your audience care about?\nWhat are the implications of your results?\n\nHow does these results affect the business or solve the problem or clarify the problem, etc.?\n\nWhich insights from your analysis will have the biggest impact?\n\n\nIf you asked for questions or comments above, summarize them and any conclusions from the discussion, which ones require further study, etc.\nIf you provided recommendations, review them and include the rationale for them ideally tied to the data, and the expected results of such actions\n\nExample: “The price reduction on  has resulted in a strong rebound in sales figures that analysis shows will increase further with additional marketing support. We recommend increasing the advertising budget for this line by 25% next quarter and would like the art department to take on design of a new campaign as their immediate action item.”\n\nDefine success metrics and what values would require a rethink of the strategy.\nDefine a timeframe\n\n“It is our hope that the additional 25% marketing investment in the  will result in Q4 revenue that is 50% over last year’s Q4 revenue for that line. We will review the results next January and meet again to discuss them and determine any changes in course going forward.”\n\nPotentially include consequences of not following recommendations\n\n“… it is unlikely sales will recover and we’ll continue to lose market share.”\n\nIf anyone made any commitments to other actions, note those.\nBring back emotional hook that you used in the intro\n\n” our analysis shows that blah, blah will justify the further investment and eliminate the need for layoffs.”\n“… should lead to a return to robust sales and profitability, along with stronger profit sharing.\nIf you used greed, conclude with how rewarding the action will be\nif you used fear, end with how the action will alleviate that fear\n\n\nQ&A\n\nPlant questions with collegues about info you wanted to include but the topic didn’t fit into the presentation\nPrepare for likely questions will have tables or other slides that answer those questions\nDisagreements or questions you don’t have an answer to:\n\nDON’T BE DISMISSIVE\n\nDon’t respone with any variant of, “you don’t trust data?” or blaming difficulties on someone’s lack of “data literacy.”\nWith so many potential sources of error or misunderstanding, it seems sensible for the data scientist to listen to concerns.\nClient questions provide an important counterweight against over-trust in data products.\n\nGive non-defensive responses\n\nA non-defensive response is helpful when you’re wrong, but pure gold when you are right (and both things will happen from time to time). If you are right, but are argumentative or dismissive, the client is likely to be upset. if you take a client’s concerns seriously and are thoughtful about addressing the situation, then turn out to be correct on top of that, you’re likely to make a very positive impression.\nPhrases\n\nThat’s a great question. We need to collect more data before we’ll be able to answer that.\nThank you for bringing that to my attention\nI need to think about that\nI’m not prepared to give that the consideration it deserves, but can we make an appointment to discuss it later?\nI hadn’t thought of it that way\nAnything is possible\n\n\nAnswer a question with a question (to clarify)\n\nA great many disagreements arise due to mismatched interpretation of goals and definitions. It’s important to fully understand the nature of the concern.\nReports sometimes are outdated or refer to a different product, department, etc.\nThey can speed up finding the root cause of your own error.\n\nUse email\n\nFollowing-up emails summarizing an issue, outlining plans, and suggesting timelines for investigations, are nearly always appreciated\n\nBe careful about taking lifelines from the audience\n\nDuring a disagreement, a helpful bystander will often offer a suggestion. Their ideas are usually generous, imagining a way that the data scientist might be correct. It might be tempting to agree, but be careful! Thoughtlessly taking a lifeline is a fast way to lose credibility.\nPhrases\n\n“That’s a possibility, John, thanks for the suggestion!”\n“Great idea, Sally, but I need more time to look at the data to be sure!”\n\n\n\nDon’t let anyone hijack q&a and turn it into a one and one conversations. Cut off or defer answering a follow up question.\n\n“Thanks for your great question, but we do need to let others ask their questions. Please follow-up with me afterwards.”\n\nThank everyone for attending and leave the front of the room.\n\nFollow-up\n\nKeep Promises\n\nAnswer questions to promised to look into\nPost slide deck if you said you would\nSchedule and attend a meeting if you said you would\n\nSend summary email to participants if any actions resulted from the meeting\nSet up monitoring of success metrics. Someone could want an interim report before the settled upon timeframe has been reached.",

Outside an 80% CI? If so that has a 20% chance of happening.\n\nIn some situations, managers who are not mathematically inclined may be suspicious of forecasts presented using technical terminology and obscure statistical notation (Taylor and Thomas, 1982).\n\nSuch a manager may respect the forecast provider’s quantitative skills, but simultaneously perceive that the provider has no understanding of managers’ forecasting needs – hence the manager distrusts the provider’s forecasts\n\nI don’t understand this one either. What could possibly be the different “forecasting need” that the manager needs?\n\n\nExplanations (i.e. justifications, rationale, etc.) of the forecast can improve people’s perceptions of a forecast. The higher the perceived value of the explanations, the higher the level of acceptance of the forecast. (Gönül et al, 2006)\n\nPeople enjoy the “stories” and it makes the forecasts more believable.\n\nProvide cues for how to evaluate the forecast in the report\nProvide accuracy metrics in relation to a reasonable benchmark\n\nExample: rolling average, naive, average for these days over the previous 5 yrs, whatever the current method is, etc.\nIn very unpredictable situations, this will help to show that relatively high forecast errors are unavoidable and not a result of the forecaster’s lack of competence.\n\nBeing transparent about assumptions, and even presenting multiple forecasts based on different assumptions, will most likely reassure the user about the integrity of the provider.",

A cognitive limitation that affects plot comprehension is the limit on working memory. Typically, working memory is limited to approximately seven (plus or minus two) items, or chunks. In practice, this means that categorical scales with more than seven categories decrease readability, increase comprehension time, and require significant attentional resources, because it is not possible to hold the legend mapping in working memory.\nThe use of redundant aesthetics that activate the same gestalt principles (such as color and shape in a scatter plot, which both activate similarity) results in higher identification of corresponding data features. In addition, dual encoding increases the accessibility of a chart to individuals who have impaired color vision or perceptual processing (e.g., dyslexia, dysgraphia).

More text, the better.\n\nTheir takeaway from the chart is more likely to resemble the annotation if it takes the form of L2 and/or L4 and is close to the data\n\nExample: Financial Times\n\n\nTitle (L2) is used for part of the takaway message\n\nSubtitle used to describe the Y-Axis\n\nChart annotation paragraph (L4) gives contextual information\n\n\nWhen to annotate\n\na design element in your visualization that needs explaining\na data point or series that you want readers to see, like an outlier\nreaders should know something to better understand why certain data points look the way they do\n\nRemove the color key/legend and directly label your categories\n\nIf the screen is small (e.g. mobile), then it’s better to keep the legend\n\nMake it obvious which units your data uses.\n\nDon’t just put units in the description, but also in axis labels, tooltips, and annotations\n\nFor large numbers (e.g. 20 million), try to use B, M, K instead of an annotation somewhere that says something like “in thousand”\nTooltips\n\nConsider not just stating the numbers in tooltips, but also the category\n\ne.g. “3.4% unemployed” instead of “3.4%,” or “+16% revenue” instead of “+16%”\n\nUse a transparent background by setting the alpha channel of CSS background-colorto a number less than 1\n\ne.g. 0.3 using rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)\n\nWith a transparent background, text behind the tooltip can interfere with the text in the tooltip, so also apply backdrop-filter\n\nExample:\n.tooltip {\n  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);\n  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(2px);\n  backdrop-filter: blur(2px);\n}\n@media (prefers-contrast: more) {\n  .tooltip {\n    background-color: white;\n    -webkit-backdrop-filter: none;\n    backdrop-filter: none;\n  }\n}\n\nExample shows a tooltip that has an HTML class of “tooltip”.\nblur is measured in pixels and the image size varies with screen width, so the optimal blur size here may vary for you depending on the dimensions of your browser window.\n\nApplies a Gaussian blur to the target element’s background with the standard deviation specified as the argument (e.g. two pixels).\n\nAs of Mar 2023, doesn’t work on Safari, so adding -webkit-backdrop-filter allows it to work on Safari\n@media (prefers-contrast: more)checks if your user has informed their operating system or browser that they prefer increased contrast. When they do, this chunk then overrides the applied styles.\n\n\n\nTransparent backgrounds might work better with thematic maps and less with scatter plots\nDon’t center-align your text\nUse straightforward phrasings\nMove axis labels nearest the most important chart objects (e.g. bars)\n\n\nIf the higher bars are what’s most important and they’re on the right, then usea right-side axis\n\nFonts for annotation\n\n\nUse what readers are most used to (e.g. sans-serif regular, &gt;12px, (almost) black text\nIf you need to need a lot of words and they don’t fit, don’t use smaller font, use a tooltip instead\n\nOn mobile screens you can also hide the least important annotations, or move them below the visualization\n\n\nLead the eye with font sizes, styles, and colors\n\n\nThe biggest and boldest text with the highest contrast against the background should be reserved for the most important information.\n\nDon’t overdo it though\n\nUse only two levels of hierarchy that are clearly different from each other — like a 12px gray and a 14px black\nEmphasize within the annotations using boldness\n\nKeep labels horizontal\n\n\nUse a text outline\n\n\nSet the stroke around your letters, using the background color of your chart.\n\nBe conversational first and precise later",

Blend a color into each color scheme to produce a more unified look\n\nExample: Blending blue into a plot with green color scheme.\n\n\nBreakpoints for scales\n\nHow to choose an interpolation for your color scale\n\nCharts (see prismatic PKG to do this manipulation within ggplot)\nPalette composition methods\n\nComplimentary\n\nopposite sides of the color wheel (2 colors)\ncontrast\n\nAnalogous\n\nsame side of the color wheel (multiple)\ngradient\n\nTriadic\n\nforms triangle on the color wheel\nvibrant, contrast\n\nOthers\n\nsplit complimentary (popular)\n\nComprised of one color and two colors symmetrically placed around it. This strategy adds more variety than complementary color schemes by including three hues without being too jarring or bold. Using this method, we end up with combinations that include warm and cool hues that are more easily balanced than the complementary color schemes\n\nquadratic\n\n\nAdjustments once you chosen a color (hue) to create variations\n\nMove brightness up for lighter variations and down for darker variations\nThen, move saturation in the opposite way you moved brightness\n\nSave colors you find attractive\n\ninstant eyedropper (windows)\nThen use HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) slider for adjustments\n\nBackgrounds\n\nWhite\n\nbright, used a lot\ntry ivory or a light gray\nshades of eggshell, link\n\nAvoid black (or REALLY dark) unless situation calls for it\n\ndark is fine\n\n\nLightest and darkest colors should have meaning (e.g. min, max, mean, zero) and not just some arbitrary numbers\n\nWhat to do when you have a lot of categories\n\nSimply don’t show different colors Does your chart work without colors?\n\n1 color and a discrete axis with the categories\n\nShow shades, not hues Can you make the chart less confetti-like?\n\nAlthough, consider not using shades when the parts are as or more important than the totals\n\nEmphasize Can you only use color for your most important categories?\nLabel directly Can you use the same or similar colors but label them?\nMerge categories Can you put categories together?\nGroup categories, but keep showing them Can strokes help to tell categories apart?\n\nChange the chart type Will another chart type rely less on colors?\n“Small multiply” it Can you split the categories into multiple charts? (i.e. facet by category)\nAdd other indicators Can you add symbols, patterns, line widths, or dashes?\n\n\nDoesn’t use any color — just opacity, thickness, and dotted lines.\n\nUse tooltips and hover effects Can smaller categories be hidden with them?\n\nColor scales should be chosen to best match the data values and plot type: If the goal is to show magnitude, a univariate color scheme is typically preferable, while a double-ended color scale is typically more effective when showing data that differ in sign and magnitude. Where possible, color scales should use a minimal number of hues, varying intensity or lightness of the color to show magnitude, and transitioning through neutral colors (white, light yellow) when utilizing a gradient. Cognitive load can also be reduced by selecting colors with cultural associations that match the data display, such as the use of blue for men and red (or pink) for women, or the use of blue for cold temperatures and red/orange for warm temperatures.\n\nIt is also important to consider the human perceptual system, which does not perceive hues uniformly: We can distinguish more shades of green than any other hue, and fewer shades of yellow, so green univariate color schemes will provide finer discriminability than other colors because the human perceptual system evolved to work in the natural world, where shades of green are plentiful.\n\n\nFigure above shows the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1931 color space, which maps the wavelength of a color to a physiologically based perceptual space; a significant portion of the color space is dedicated to greens and blues, while much smaller regions are dedicated to violet, red, orange, and yellow colors. This unevenness in mapping color is one reason that the multi-hued rainbow color scheme is suboptimal—the distance between points in a given color space may not be the same as the distance between points in perceptual space. As a result of the uneven mapping between color space and perceptual space, multi-hued color schemes are not recommended.",

Effect will be overestimated and the CI too narrow\nAdjusting for the effect of a confounding variable, dichotomisation will run the risk that a substantial part of the confounding remains\n\n\nHarrell\n\nThink most of these issues are related to inference models like types of logistic regression\nA better approach that maximizes power and that only assumes a smooth relationship is to use a restricted cubic spline (regression spline; piecewise cubic polynomial) function for predictors that are not known to predict linearly. Use of flexible parametric approaches such as this allows standard inference techniques (P -values, confidence limits) to be used (See Feature Engineering, Splines)\nIssues with binning continuous variables\n\nIf cutpoints are chosen by trial and error in a way that utilizes the response, even informally, ordinary P -values will be too small and confidence intervals will not have the claimed coverage probabilities.\n\nThe correct Monte-Carlo simulations must take into account both multiple tests and uncertainty in the choice of cutpoints.\n\nUsing the “minimum p-value approach” often results in multiple cutpoints so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ plus multiple testing p-value adjustments need to be used.\n\nThis approach involves testing multiple cutpoints and choosing one that minimizes the p-value below a threshold.\n\nOptimal cutpoints often change from sample to sample\nThe optimal cutpoint for a predictor would necessarily be a function of the continuous values of all the other predictors\nYou’re losing variation (information) which causes a loss of power and precision\nAssumes that the relationship between the predictor and the response is flat within each interval\n\nthis assumption is far less reasonable than a linearity assumption in most cases\n\nPercentiles\n\nUsually estimated from the data at hand, are estimated with sampling error, and do not relate to percentiles of the same variable in a population\nValue of binned variable potentially takes on a different relationship with the outcome\n\ne.g. Body Mass Index has a smooth relationship with every outcome studied, and relates to outcome according to anatomy and physiology. Binning may change that relationship to being how many subjects have a similar BMI.\n\n\nMany bins usually required to make it worth it. Therefore, many dummy variables will end up being created resulting in a loss of power and precision. (i.e. more bins = more variables = more dof used)\nPoor predictive performance with Cox regression models\n\n\nThey might help with prediction using ML or DL models though\n\n“Instead of directly using marketplace health as a continuous feature, we decided to use a form of target-encoding by splitting up the metric into buckets and taking the average historical delivery duration within that bucket as the new feature. With this approach, we directly helped the model learn that very supply-constrained market conditions are correlated with very high delivery times — rather than relying on the model to learn those patterns from the relatively sparse data available.”\n\nImproving ETA Prediction Accuracy for Long Tail Events\nHelps to “represent features in a way that makes it easy for the model to learn sparse patterns.”\n\nThis article was about modeling tail events, so maybe this is most useful for features that have an association with the tail values in the outcome variable\n\n\nXGBoost seems to like numerics much more than dummies\n\nTrees may prefer larger cardinalities.

Without scaling, it may be the case that one variable has a larger impact on the sum due purely to its scale, which may be undesirable.\nOther Examples:\n\nResearch into children’s behavioral disorders - researchers might get ratings from both parents & teachers, & then want to combine them into a single measure of maladjustment.\nStudy on the activity level at a nursing home w/ self-ratings by residents & the number of signatures on sign-up sheets for activities\n\n\nTo simplify calculations and notation.\n\nA sample covariance matrix of values that has been centered by their sample means is simply X′X (correlation matrix)\nIf a univariate random variable, X, has been mean centered, then var(X)=E(X2) and the variance can be estimated from a sample by looking at the sample mean of the squares of the observed values.\n\n\nReasons NOT to standardize\n\nWe don’t want to standardize when the value of 0 is meaningful.\n\nstep_best_normalize\n\nRequires {bestNormalize} and has bestNormalize for use outside of {tidymodels}\nChooses the best standardization method using repeated cross-validation to estimate the Pearson’s P statistic divided by its degrees of freedom (from {nortest}) which indicates closness to the Gaussian distribution.\nPackage features the method, Ordered Quantile normalization (orderNorm, or ORQ). ORQ transforms the data based off of a rank mapping to the normal distribution.\nAlso includes: Lambert W\\(\\times\\)F, Box Cox, Yeo-Johnson, arcsinh, exponential, log, square root, and has a method to add your own.\nExample\nlibrary(bestNormalize)\n\ndata(ames, package = \"modeldata\")\n\nrecipe(Sale_Price ~ Lot_Frontage + Lot_Area, data = ames) |&gt;\n  step_best_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) |&gt;\n  prep() |&gt;\n  bake(new_data = NULL)\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 2,930 × 3\n#&gt;    Lot_Frontage Lot_Area Sale_Price\n#&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n#&gt;  1        2.48     2.29      215000\n#&gt;  2        0.789    0.689     105000\n#&gt;  3        0.883    1.28      172000\n#&gt;  4        1.33     0.574     244000\n#&gt;  5        0.468    1.19      189900\n#&gt;  6        0.656    0.201     195500\n#&gt;  7       -0.702   -1.27      213500\n#&gt;  8       -0.669   -1.24      191500\n#&gt;  9       -0.735   -1.19      236500\n#&gt; 10       -0.170   -0.654     189000\n#&gt; # ℹ 2,920 more rows\n\nscale(var or matrix)\n\nDefault args: center = T, scale = T\nStandardizes each column of a matrix separately\nFYI scale(var) == scale(scale(var))\n\n{datawizard::standardize} - Can center by median and scale by MAD (robust), can scale by 2sd (Gelman)\n{{sklearn::RobustScaler}}\n\nStandardize by median and IQR instead of mean and sd\n\n(value − median) / IQR\n\nThe resulting variable has a zero mean and median and a standard deviation of 1, although not skewed by outliers and the outliers are still present with the same relative relationships to other values.\nstep_normalize has means, sd args, so it might be able to do this\n\nHarrell recommends substituting the gini mean difference for the standard deviation\n\nGini’s mean difference - the mean absolute difference between any two distinct elements of a vector.\n\n\nHmisc::GiniMd(x, na.rm = F) (doc)\nsjstats::gmd(x or df, ...)

If they are outliers, then the range of your data will be more constricted that it needs to be.\n\ne.g. if values are in between 100 and 500 with an exceptional value of 25000, then 25000 is scaled as 1 and all the other values become very close to the lower bound of zero\n\nExample: Age is the predictor and Happiness is the outcome. Imagine a very strong relationship between age and happiness, such that happiness is at its maximum at age 18 and its minimum at age 65. It’ll be easier if we rescale age so that the range from 18 to 65 is one unit. Now this new variable A ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is age 18 and 1 is age 65. (from Statistical Rethinking section 6.3.1 pg 182)\nd2 &lt;- d[ d$age&gt;17 , ] # only adults\nd2$A &lt;- ( d2$age - 18 ) / ( 65 - 18 )\n\nRange: [a, b]\n\nAlso see notebook for code to transform more than 1 variable at a time.\n\nBy max\nscaled_var = var/max(var)\n\nExample: From Statistical Rethinking, pg 246\n\n“… zero ruggedness is meaningful. So instead terrain ruggedness is divided by the maximum value observed. This means it ends up scaled from totally flat (zero) to the maximum in the sample at 1 (Lesotho, a very rugged and beautiful place).”\n\nExample: From Statistical Rethinking, pg 258\n\n“I’ve scaled blooms by its maximum observed value, for three reasons. First, the large values on the raw scale will make optimization difficult. Second, it will be easier to assign a reasonable prior this way. Third, we don’t want to standardize blooms, because zero is a meaningful boundary we want to preserve.”\n\nblooms is bloom size. So there can’t be a negative but zero makes sense.\nblooms is 2 magnitudes larger than both its predictors.\n\n\n\nBy mean\nscaled_var = var/mean(var)\n\nExample: From Statistical Rethinking, pg 246\n\n“log GDP is divided by the average value. So it is rescaled as a proportion of the international average. 1 means average, 0.8 means 80% of the average, and 1.1 means 10% more than average.”\n\n\n\n\n\nLogging\n\nUseful for skewed variables\nIf you have zeros, then its common to add 1 to the predictor values\n\nTo backtransform: exp(logged_predictor) - 1\narcsinh(x): approximates a log (at large values of x) but handles 0s:\n\nBacktransform: log(x + sqrt(1+x^2))\n\n* Don’t use these for outcome variables (See Regression, Other &gt;&gt; Zero-Inflated/Truncated &gt;&gt; Continuous for methods, Thread for discussion and link to a paper on the alternatives)\n\nThe scale of the outcome matters. The thread links to a discussion of a paper on log transforms.\nProposals in the paper are in Section 4.1. One of the recommendations is log(E[Y(0)] + Y) where (I think) E[Y(0)] is the average value of Y when Treatment = 0 but I’m not sure. Need to read the paper.\n\n\nRemember to back-transform predictions if you transformed the target variable\n# log 10 transformed target variable\npreds_intervals &lt;- predict(\n  workflows::pull_workflow_fit(lm_wf),\n  workflows::pull_workflow_prepped_recipe(lm_wf) %&gt;% bake(ames_holdout),\n  type = \"pred_int\",\n  level = 0.90\n) %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(contains(\".pred\"), ~10^.x))\nCombos\n\nLog + scale by mean\n\nExample From Statistical Rethinking Ch8 pg 246\n\n“Raw magnitudes of GDP aren’t meaningful to humans. Since wealth generates wealth, it tends to be exponentially related to anything that increases it (earlier in chapter). This is like saying that the absolute distances in wealth grow increasingly large, as nations become wealthier. So when we work with logarithms instead, we can work on a more evenly spaced scale of magnitudes”\n“Log GDP is divided by the average value. So it is rescaled as a proportion of the international average. 1 means average, 0.8 means 80% of the average, and 1.1 means 10% more than average.”",

I’ve seen examples where hashes look very different when 1 small thing changes — but maybe it was the algorithm. Also seems like it would be poor security if things that looked similar had similar hashes.\nSee Privacy for hashing packages\nBeyond security and fast look-ups, hashing is used for similarity search.\n\ne.g. Different pictures of the same thing should have similar hashes\nSo, if these hashes are being binned, you’d want something a hashing algorithm thinks is similar to actually be similar in order for this to be most effective.\n\nzip codes, postal codes, lat + long would be good\nNot countries or counties since I’d think the hashing similarity would be related to how similar they are alphabetically or maybe phonetically\nMaybe something like latin species names since those have similar roots, etc. would work. (e.g. dogs are canis-whatever)\n\n\nCan’t be reversed to the original values\n\nAlthough since you have the original, it seems like you could see which cat levels are in a particular hash and maybe glean some latent variable\n\nCreates dummies for each cat but fewer of them.\n\nIt is likely that multiple levels of the column will map to the same hashed columns (even with small data sets). Similarly, it is likely that some columns will have all zeros.\n\nA zero-variance filter (via recipes::step_zv) is recommended for any recipe that uses hashed columns\n\n\ntextrecipes::step_dummy_hash - Dimension Reduction. Create dummy variables, but instead of giving each level its own column, you run the level through a hashing function (MurmurHash3) to determine the column.\n\nnum_terms: Tuning parameter tha controls the number of indices that the hashing function will map to. Since the hashing function can map two different tokens to the same index, will a higher value of num_terms result in a lower chance of collision.\nExample\ndata(ames, package = \"modeldata\")\n\nrecipe(Sale_Price ~ Neighborhood, data = ames) |&gt;\n  step_dummy_hash(Neighborhood, num_terms = 4) |&gt; # Low for example\n  prep() |&gt;\n  bake(new_data = NULL)\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 2,930 × 5\n#&gt;    Sale_Price dummyhash_Neighborhood_1 dummyhash_Neighborhood_2\n#&gt;         &lt;int&gt;                    &lt;int&gt;                    &lt;int&gt;\n#&gt;  1     215000                        0                       -1\n#&gt;  2     105000                        0                       -1\n#&gt;  3     172000                        0                       -1\n#&gt;  4     244000                        0                       -1\n#&gt;  5     189900                        0                        0\n#&gt;  6     195500                        0                        0\n#&gt;  7     213500                        0                        0\n#&gt;  8     191500                        0                        0\n#&gt;  9     236500                        0                        0\n#&gt; 10     189000                        0                        0\n#&gt; # ℹ 2,920 more rows\n#&gt; # ℹ 2 more variables: dummyhash_Neighborhood_3 &lt;int&gt;,\n#&gt; #   dummyhash_Neighborhood_4 &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nLikelihood Encodings\n\nEstimate the effect of each of the factor levels on the outcome and these estimates are used as the new encoding.

Then, you extract the posterior for each constructed ordinal level.

    "text": "Reasons for not running a RCT\n\nIt’s just not technically feasible to have individual-level randomization of users as we would in a classical A/B test\n\ne.g. randomizing which individuals see a billboard ad is not possible\n\nWe can randomize but expect interference between users assigned to different experiences, either through word-of-mouth, mass media, or even our own ranking systems; in short, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) would be violated, biasing the results\n\nA gold-standard design is a 6-period 2-treatment randomized crossover study; the patient actually receives both treatments and her responses can be compared (Harrell)\nATE for RCT:\n\nNon-theoretical ATE (i.e. calculated from actual data) is sample-averaged; population sampling weights are unavailable for RCT subject groups. So this ATE applies to a replication of the study with similar sampling patterns. ATE does not apply to the population and in fact may apply to no one due to lack of conditioning on patient characteristics. The ATE used in 99% of papers has nothing to do with population but uses only convenience sample weighting.  Some papers even blatantly call it population-averaged.”\n“They test causal hypotheses about a group of patients with symptoms & other ‘diagnostic’ findings that form entry criteria for the RCT & may only be available in sufficient numbers in specialist centres.”\nGelman\n\n“the drug works on some people and not others—or in some comorbidity scenarios and not others—we realize that”the treatment effect” in any given study will depend entirely on the patient mix. There is no underlying number representing the effect of the drug. Ideally one would like to know what sorts of patients the treatment would help, but in a clinical trial it is enough to show that there is some clear average effect. My point is that if we consider the treatment effect in the context of variation between patients, this can be the first step in a more grounded understanding of effect size.\n\nGelman regarding a 0.1 ATE for a treatment in an education study\n\n“Actually, though, an effect of 0.1 GPA is a lot. One way to think about this is that it’s equivalent to a treatment that raises GPA by 1 point for 10% of people and has no effect on the other 90%. That’s a bit of an oversimplification, but the point is that this sort of intervention might well have little or no effect on most people. In education and other fields, we try lots of things to try to help students, with the understanding that any particular thing we try will not make a difference most of the time. If mindset intervention can make a difference for 10% of students, that’s a big deal. It would be naive to think that it would make a difference for everybody: after all, many students have a growth mindset already and won’t need to be told about it.\n“Maybe in some fields of medicine this is cleaner because you can really isolate the group of patients who will be helped by a particular treatment. But in social science this seems much harder.”\n\nMe: So, a 0.1 effect wouldn’t be large if there was no variation (i.e. same size effect for everyone), but that’s very unlikely to be the case.\n\n\n\nCalculation of standard-errors is different depending on the RCT type in order that variation within arms could be validly used to estimate variation between.\nRandom Sampling vs Random Treatment Allocation (source)\n\nRandom Sampling: licenses the use of measures of uncertainty  for (sub)groups of sampled patients.\nRandom Treatment Allocation: licenses the use of measures of uncertainty for the differences between the allocated groups.\n\nRe RCTs:\n\nlicenses the use of measures of uncertainty for hazard ratios, odds ratios, risk ratios, median/mean survival difference, absolute risk reduction etc that measure differences between groups.\nBecause there is no random sampling, measures of uncertainty are not licensed by the randomization procedure for cohort-specific estimates such as the median survival observed in each treatment cohort.\n\nFor those, we can use descriptive measures such as standard deviation (SD), interquartile range etc. Measures of uncertainty will require further assumptions to be considered valid. Further discussion here”\n\n\n\n\nBalance - Balanced allocations are more efficient in that they lead to lower variances\n\nVariance of the Mean difference (e.g between treatment and control groups) for unbalanced design\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}\n\\]\n\nFollow-Up\n\nIn-Trial Follow-Up (ITFU)\n\nWithout ITFU, the unbiased ascertainment of outcomes may be compromised and statistical power considerably reduced\nStrategies\n\nFace-to-face follow-up is widely used during the initial “in-trial” period, but is costly if employed longer term.\nTelephone-based approaches are more practical, with the ability to contact many participants coordinated by a central trial office\nPostal follow-up has been shown to be effective.\nWeb-based techniques may become more widespread as technological advances develop.\n\n\nPost-Trial Follow-Up (PTFU)\n\nRCTs are costly and usually involve a relatively brief treatment period with limited follow-up. A treatment response restricted to this brief “in-trial” period can potentially underestimate the long-term benefits of treatment and also may fail to detect delayed hazards.\nStrategies\n\nSee ITFU strategies\nUse of routine health records can provide detailed information relatively inexpensively, but the availability of such data and rules governing access to it varies across countries.",

    "text": "RCT Features\n\nThree valuable design features of clinical trials are concurrent control, randomization and blinding.\n\nBlinding is weak at best without Randomization\nRandomization is impossible without Concurrent Control,\nConcurrent Control is necessary for the other two, so it can be regarded as the most important of the three.\n\nBlinding or Masking - patients are unaware of the treatment they are receiving and treating physicians are unaware of the treatment they are administering\n\nPrevents differential care during follow-up, accounts for nonspecific effects associated with receiving an intervention (placebo effects), may facilitate blinding of outcome assessors, and may improve adherence.\n\nConcurrent Control - the effect of a treatment should be assessed by comparing the results of subjects treated with the intervention being studied with the results of subjects treated concurrently (i.e. at the ‘same’ places at the ‘same’ times) with a control treatment, for example, placebo.\n\nIn reality\n\nRe ‘same time’: the idea behind concurrent control is that the times at which they are recruited will vary randomly within treatment arms in the same way as between, so that variation in outcomes arising as a result of the former can be used to judge variation in outcomes as a result of the latter.\n\nTiming matters: The time at which a patient is recruited into the trial matters, but should not be biasing if patients are randomized throughout the trial to intervention and control. It will tend to increase the variance of the treatment effect, and rightly so, but it is a component that may be possible to eliminate (partially) by modelling a trend effect.\n\nExample: 1990s AIDS studies found survival of patients who were recruited later into trials tended to be better than those recruited earlier\n\n\nRe ‘same place’: The vast majority of randomised clinical trials are run in many centers. The variations in design around this many-centers aspect is the primary difference between various types of RCTs (see below). All the types will be regarded as employing concurrent control, but have their standard errors calculated differently.\n\nConsequence of violations\n\nIf variation from center to center is ignored and patients have not been randomized concurrently, then Fisher’s exact test, Pearson’s chi-square and Student’s t will underestimate the variation\n\n\nRandomized assignment means that eligible units are randomly assigned to a treatment or comparison group. Each eligible unit has an equal chance of being selected. This tends to generate internally valid impact estimates under the weakest assumptions.\n\nRandomization also allows us to achieve statistical independence, which eliminates omitted variable bias. Statistical independence implies that the treatment variable is not correlated with the other variables. The key assumption is that randomization effectively produces two groups that are statistically identical with respect to observed and unobserved characteristics. In other words, the treatment group is the same as the control group on average.\n\ni.e. randomization process renders the experimental groups largely comparable. Thus, we can attribute any differences in the final metrics between the experimental groups to the intervention.\n\nIn the absence of randomization, we might fall victim to this omitted variable bias because our treatment variable will probably be endogenous. That is, it will be probably correlated with other variables excluded from the model (omitted variable bias).",

    "section": "Assignment Options",
    "text": "Assignment Options\n\nRandomization\n\nIndividual Randomization - The individual or patient that is allocated to an intervention (may be more than one intervention group) or control group, and simple statistical analyses on participant outcomes are used to evaluate if the intervention was effective.\n\nThese analyses assume that all participants are completely independent (ie. unlike each other, do not influence each other, and any outcomes measured on them are influenced by the intervention or usual care in the same way)\nStratified Randomization - Study participants are first divided into strata or subgroups based on one or more relevant characteristics or variables that are thought to influence response to treatment (i.e. confounders). Then, within each stratum, participants are randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups.\n\nThe purpose is to increase statistical precision and ensure balance across known confounding factors.\nStrafiication variables could be age, gender, severity of disease, or any other potentially confounding factors.\nThe purpose of stratification is to ensure that the treatment and control groups are balanced concerning these potentially confounding variables, which can improve the precision and statistical power of the study.\nTo obtain valid inference following stratified randomisation, treatment effects should be estimated with adjustment for stratification variables.\n\nIf stratification variables are originally continuous but have been discretized for purposes of stratification (e.g. Age), then the continuous form of these variables should be used in the model. (Paper)\n\n\nBlock Randomization\n\nThe purpose is to control for known sources of variability and remove their effects from the experimental error\nTwitter thread presenting an example of the procedure for a block randomized RCT\nSimilar to Stratified Randomization but blocks are formed based on practical considerations, such as time, location, or specific characteristics of participants or experimental units. (Models seem to be the same though)\n\nExample: These hospitals volunteered to participate in my study and I wish to randomize individuals within groups. I have no reason to believe that a particular hospital envirnoment will affect the treatment’s efficacy on the outcome variable (i.e hospital is not a confounder), but I wish to account for it in order to reduce error.\n\nDesigns with unequal sized blocks are known as Incomplete Block Designs\n\nThe assumption of homogeneous variances across blocks is likely to be violated when block sizes differ greatly. This violates one of the standard ANOVA assumptions.\nTypically modelled by Weighted Least Squares or Mixed Effects. Random effects for blocks to account for the variability between blocks, and fixed effects for treatment effects.\n\nBlock Designs\n\nLatin Square\n\nIt’s commonly used in situations where there are two sources of variability that need to be controlled, such as when testing multiple treatments in different orders or sequences while accounting for variations in time or space.\nAppropriate when complete randomization of treatments is feasible and desirable. This design requires no natural structure or hierarchy among experimental units (see Split-Plot for comparison), and treatments can be applied independently to each unit.\nEach treatment appears once in each row and each column of the Latin square, ensuring that each treatment occurs in every possible position relative to the other treatments.\nUseful for reducing noise and increasing efficiency.\nVariations of the Latin square design, such as the Graeco-Latin square design, can be used to extend the concept to accommodate groups or blocks of experimental units. In these designs, the basic principles of the Latin square are applied within each block or group, allowing for more flexibility in experimental design while still controlling for sources of variation\nExample: Does Music Genre Affect Work Productivity\n\n\n\n\nLocation 1\nLocation 2\nLocation 3\nLocation 4\n\n\n\n\nTime 1\nGenre A\nGenre B\nGenre C\nGenre D\n\n\nTime 2\nGenre D\nGenre A\nGenre B\nGenre C\n\n\nTime 3\nGenre C\nGenre D\nGenre A\nGenre B\n\n\nTime 4\nGenre B\nGenre C\nGenre D\nGenre A\n\n\n\n\nDetermine if there are significant differences in task performance across the different music genres while controlling for potential confounding factors (time of day and office location).\nEach cell is a different study participant which receives a particular treatment at a particular location and particular time.\n\n\nSplit-Plot\n\nParticularly useful when there is a hierarchical structure to the experimental units\nHandles hard-to-randomize factors such as logistical factors\nThe whole plots are for hard-to-randomize factors and subplots are for easy-to-randomize factors. It controls variability due to the whole plot factor.\nExample: Effects of Learning Environment and Study Technique on Memory Recall\n\nMain Plots (Groups of Participatnts)\n\n\n\nPlot 1\nPlot 2\n\n\nPlot 3\nPlot 4\n\n\n\n\nEach plot consists of 20 participants\nPlot 1: Participants from Psychology Department\nPlot 2: Participants from Biology Department\nPlot 3: Participants from English Department\nPlot 4: Participants from Mathematics Department\nNote how it would be impossible to randomly assign students to each department.\n\nSubplots within each main plot\n\n\n\n\nRepeated Reading\nMind Mapping\n\n\nQuiet Room\nsubgroup 1\nsubgroup 2\n\n\nNoisy Café\nsubgroup 3\nsubgroup 4\n\n\n\n\nEach subgroup has 5 participants and are randomly assigned to a combination of two treatments: Environment and Study Technique.\n\n\n\nFamily Block - Naturally occurring groups or families (e.g. litters, plots with similar soil conditions, etc.).\n\n\n\nCluster Randomization - One in which intact social units, or clusters of individuals rather than individuals themselves, are randomized to different intervention groups\n\nAll participants recruited from the practice, school or workplace are allocated to either the intervention or the control group\nThe outcomes of the intervention are still measured at the individual level, but the level at which the comparison is made is the practice, school or workplace\nAdvantages\n\nMembers from intervention and control groups are less likely to have direct contact with each other and are less likely to pass on components of the intervention to the control group. (i.e. contamination)\nThere may also be increased compliance due to group participation.\nClusters typically consistent in their management.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Strategy\n\nParallel Group - Subjects are randomized to one or more study arms (aka treatment groups) and each study arm will be allocated a different intervention. After randomization each participant will stay in their assigned treatment arm for the duration of the study\n\nThink this is just typical randomization into treatment/control groups but can be extended to include multiple treatment arms.\n“Change from Baseline” (aka Change Scores) should never be the outcome variable\nCentral Question: For two patients with the same premeasurement value of x, one given treatment A and the other treatment B, will the patients tend to have different post-treatment values of y?\n\nCrossover Group - Subjects are randomly allocated to study arms where each arm consists of a sequence of two or more treatments given consecutively.\n\ni.e. each subject receives more than one treatment and each treatment occurs sequentially over the duration of the study.\nExample: AB/BA study - Subjects allocated to the AB study arm receive treatment A first, followed by treatment B, and vice versa in the BA arm.\nAllows the response of a subject to treatment A to be contrasted with the same subject’s response to treatment B.\n\nRemoving patient variation in this way makes crossover trials potentially more efficient than similar sized, parallel group trials in which each subject is exposed to only one treatment.\n\nIn theory treatment effects can be estimated with greater precision given the same number of subjects.\nMisc\n\nBest practice is to avoid this design if there is a reasonable chance of Carry Over\nAlso see\n\nSenn SJ. Crossover trials in clinical research. Chichester: John Wiley; 1993, 2002.\n\n“Readable approach to the problems of designing and analysing crossover trials”\nSee R &gt;&gt; Documents &gt;&gt; Experimental Design\nKurz notes on Chapters 3 and 4 with updated R code\n\n\n\nIssue: Carry Over\n\nEffects of one treatment may “carry over” and alter the response to subsequent treatments.\n(Pre-experiment) Solution: introduce a washout (no treatment) period between consecutive treatments which is long enough to allow the effects of a treatment to wear off.\n\nA variation is to restrict outcome measurement to the latter part of each treatment period. Investigators then need to understand the likely duration of action of a given treatment and its potential for interaction with other treatments.\n\nTesting for Carry Over\n\nIf carry over is present the outcome on a given treatment will vary according to its position in the sequence of treatments.\nExample: Concluding that there was no carry over when an analysis of variance found no statistically significant interaction between treatment sequence and outcome.1\nHowever such tests have limited power and cannot rule out a type II error (wrongly concluding there is no carry over effect).\n\n(Post-experiment) Solution: If Carry Over is detected:\n\nOption 1: Treat the study as though it were a parallel group trial and confine analysis to the first period alone.\n\nThe advantages of the crossover are lost, with the wasted expense of discarding the data from the second period.\nMore importantly, the significance test comparing the first periods may be invalid\n\nOption 2 (applicable only to studies with at least three treatment periods, e.g. ABB/BAA)\n\nModel the carry over effect and use it to adjust the treatment estimate.\nSuch approaches, while statistically elegant, are based on assumptions which can rarely be justified in practice.\nSee Senn paper above\n\n\n\n\nRandomized designs are classified as completely randomized design, complete block design, randomized block design, Latin square design, split pot design, crossover design, family block design, stepped-wedge cluster design, etc.\n\nCompletely Randomized Parallel Group trial - Any given center will have some patients randomly allocated to intervention and some to control. Randomization includes centers (i.e. a patient is randomly selected either treatment/control and which center they will receive the treatment)\n\nParallel Group Blocked by Center - Randomization happens within each center (i.e. each center handles their own randomization). Treatment/Control ratio is the same for each center.\n\n“Center” should be included as a variable in the model.\n\n\nCluster-Randomized trial - Randomly allocate some centers to dispense the intervention and some the control\n\nFundamental unit of inference becomes the center and patients are regarded as repeated measures on it\n\n\nExamples\n\nThe effects of a leading mindfulness meditation app (Headspace) on mental health, productivity, and decision-making (Paper)\n\nRCT with 2,384 US adults recruited via social media ads.\nFour-week experiment\n\nfirst group is given free access to the app (worth $13)\nsecond group receives, in addition, a $10 incentive to use the app at least four or ten separate days during the first two weeks\nthird group serves as a (waitlist) control group",

Leads to overestimated treatment effects, because of the physical component of interventions\n\nExample: if participants know that they are in the active treatment rather than the control condition, this could create positive expectations that have an impact on treatment outcome beyond that of the intervention itself.\nSolution: Blinding - participants and investigators should remain unaware of which group participants are assigned to.\n\nMore easily achieved in medication trials than in surgical trials\n\n\nDetection Bias - Refers to systematic differences in the way outcomes are determined.\n\nExample: if providers in a psychotherapy trial are aware of the investigators’ hypotheses, this knowledge could unconsciously influence the way they rate participants’ progress.\nSolution: Attention to conflicts of interest and Blinding (also see Performance Bias) - RCTs address this by utilizing independent outcome assessors who are blind to participants’ assigned treatment groups and investigators’ expectations.\n\nAttrition Bias - occurs when there are systematic differences between groups in withdrawals from a study.\n\nIt’s common for participants to drop out of a trial before or in the middle of treatment, and researchers who only include those who completed the protocol in their final analyses are not presenting the full picture.\nSolution: Intention to Treat analysis - Analyses should include all participants who were randomized into the study, and not only participants who completed some or all of the intervention.\n\nReporting Bias - Refers to systematic differences between reported and unreported data.\n\nExample: publication bias - occurs because studies with positive results are more likely to be published, and tend to be published more quickly, than studies with findings supporting the null hypothesis.\nExample: outcome reporting bias - occurs when researchers only write about study outcomes that were in line with their hypotheses.\nSolution: Requirements that RCT protocols be published in journals or on trial registry websites, which allows for confirmation that all primary outcomes are reported in study publications.\n\nOther Bias - A catch-all category that includes specific situations not covered by the above domains.\n\nIncludes bias that can occur when study interventions are not delivered with fidelity, or when there is “contamination” between experimental and control interventions within a study (for example, participants in different treatment conditions discussing the interventions they are receiving with each other).",

Otherwise, the resampling process can produce poor estimates of model performance.\n\ndata leakage: if you first upsample the data and then split the data into training (aka analysis set) and validation (aka assessment set) folds, your model can simply memorize the positives from the training data and achieve artificially strong performance on the validation data, causing you to think that the model is much better than it actually is.\nThe subsampling process should only be applied to the analysis (aka training) set. The assessment (aka validation) set should reflect the event rates seen “in the wild.”\n\nDoes {recipe} handle this correctly?\n\n\nProcess\n\nSubsample the data only in the analysis set\nPerform CV algorithm selection and tuning using a suitable metric for class imbalance\nUse same metric to get score on the test set\n\n\nML Methods\n\nSynthetic Data Approaches\n\nTabDDPM: Modeling Tabular Data with Diffusion Models (Raschka Thread)\n\nCategorical and Binary Features: adds uniform noise via multinomial diffusion\nNumerical Features: adds Gaussian noise using Gaussian diffusion\n\nSynthetic Data Vault (Docs)\n\nData generated with variational autoencoders adapted for tabular data (TVAE) (paper)\nCan Synthetic Data Boost Machine Learning Performance?\n\n\nImbalanced Classification via Layered Learning (ICLL)\n\nFor code, see article\nA hierarchical model composed of two levels:\n\nLevel 1: A model is built to split easy-to-predict instances from difficult-to-predict ones.\n\nThe goal is to predict if an input instance belongs to a cluster with at least one observation from the minority class.\n\nLevel 2: We discard the easy-to-predict cases.

    "text": "Calibration\n\nCalibrated- When the predicted probabilities from a model match the observed distribution of probabilities for each class.\n\nCalibration Plots visualize this comparison of distributions\n\nCalibration mesasure are important for validating a predictive model.\n\nLogistic Regression models are usually well-calibrated, but most ML and DL model predicted probabilities aren’t directly produced by the algorithms and aren’t usually calibrated\nRF models can also benefit from calibration although given enough data, they are already pretty well calibrated\nSVM, Naive Bayes, boosted tree algorithms, and DL models benefit most from calibration\n\nAn unintended consequence of applying calibration modeling can be the worsening of calibration for models that are already well calibrated\nIf a model isn’t calibrated, then the magnitude of the predicted probability cannot be interpreted as the likelihood of an event\n\ne.g. If 0.66 and 0.67 are two predicted probabilities from an uncalibrated xgboost model, the 0.67 prediction cannot be interpreted as more likely to be an event than the 0.66 prediction.\nMiscalibrated predictions don’t allow you to have more confidence in a label with a higher probability than a label with a lower probability.\nSee (below) the introduction in the paper, “A tutorial on calibration measurements …” for examples of scenarios where calibration of risk scoring model is essential. If you can’t trust the predicted probabilities (i.e. risk) then decision-making is impossible.\n\nalso this paper which also explains some sources of miscalibration (e.g. dataset from region with low incidence, measurement error, etc.)\n\n\nEven if a model isn’t caibrated and depending on the metric, it can still be more accurate than a calibrated model.\n\nPoor calibration may make an algorithm less clinically useful than a competitor algorithm that has a lower AUC but is well calibrated (paper)\nCalibration doesn’t affect the AUROC (does not rely on predicted probabilities) but does affect the Brier Score (does rely on predicted probabilities) (paper)(Harrell)\nSince thresholds are based on probabilities, I don’t see how a valid, optimized threshold can be established for an uncalibrated model\nWonder how this affects model-agnostic metrics, feature importance, shap, etc.\n\n\n\nMisc\n\nAlso see Diagnostics, Classification &gt;&gt; Calibration\nPackages\n\n{probably} - tidymodels calibration package\n\nCalibrating Binary Probabilities - Nice tutorial\n\n\nNotes from:\n\nHow and When to Use a Calibrated Classification Model with scikit-learn\nCan I Trust My Model’s Probabilities? A Deep Dive into Probability Calibration\n\nPython, multiclass example\n\nA tutorial on calibration measurements and calibration models for clinical prediction models (paper)\n\nCalibration curves for nested cv (post)\nFor calibrated models, sample size affects the how well they’re calibrated\n\n\nEven for a logistic model, N &gt; 1000 is desired for good calibration\nFor a rf, closer to N = 10,000 is probably needed.\n\nDistributions of predicted probabilities\n\n\nRandom Forest pushes the probabilities towards 0.0 and 1.0, while the probabilities from the logistic regression are less skewed.\nDecision Trees are even more skewed than RF\nSays how rare a prediction is.\n\nIn a rf, really low or high probability predictions aren’t rare. So, if the model gives you a 0.93, you shouldn’t interpet it the way you normally would such a high probability (i.e. high certainty), because a rf inherently pushes its probabilities towards 0 and 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Workflow\n\nMisc\n\nIdeally you’d want each model (i.e. tuning parameter combination) being scored in a CV or a nested CV to have its own calibration model, but it’s not practical. But also, it’s unlikely an algorithm with a slightly different parameter value combination with have a substantially different predicted probability distribution, and it’s the algorithm itself that’s the salient factor. Therefore, for now, I’d go with 1 calibration model per algorithm.\n\nProcess\n\nSplit data into Training, Calibration, and Test\nFor each algorithm, train the algorithm on the Training set, and create the calibration model using it and the Calibration set.\n\nEach algorithm with have it’s own calibration model\nSee below, Example: AdaBoost in Py using CV calibrator\n\nI like sklearn’s ideas for training a calibration model\n\n\nUse the Training set for CV or Nested CV\nFor each split during CV or Nested CV (outer loop)\n\nTrain the algorithm on the training fold, predict on the validation fold, calibrate predictions with calibration model, score the calibrated predictions for that fold\n\nThe calibration model could be used in the tuning process in the inner loop of Nested CV as well\n\nScores should include calibration metrics (See Diagnostics, Classification &gt;&gt; Calibration &gt;&gt; Basic Workflow)\n\nThe rest is normal CV/Nested CV procedure\n\ni.e. average scores across the splits then select the algorithm with the best score. Predict and score algorithm on the Test set\nSee Calibration curves for nested cv for details and code on averaging calibration curves\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nMisc\n\nTLDR; Both Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression methods are the essentially the same except:\n\nPlatt Scaling uses a logistic regression model as the calibration model\nIsotonic Regression uses an isotonic regression model on ordered data as the calibration model\n\n\nPlatt Scaling\n\nMisc\n\nSuitable for smaller data and for calibration curves with the S-shape.\nMay fail when model is already well calibrated (e.g. logistic regression models)\nPerforms best under the assumption that the predicted probabilities are close to the midpoint and away from the extremes\n\nSo, might be bad for tree models but okay for SVM, Naive Bayes, etc.\n\n\nProcess\n\nSplit data into Training, Calibration, and Test Sets\nTrain your model on the Training Set\nGet the predicted probabilities from your model on the Test Set\nFit a logistic regression using your model’s predicted probabilities for the Calibration Set as the predictor and the outcome variable in the Calibration Set as the outcome\nCalibrated probabilities are the predicted probabilities of the LR model using your model’s predicted probabilites on the Test set as new data.\n\nExample: SVM in R\nsvm_platt_recal = svm_platt_recal_func(model_fit, calib_dat, test_preds, test_dat)\n\nsvm_platt_recal_func = function(model_fit, calib_dat, test_preds, test_dat){\n\n  # Predict on Calibration Set \n  cal_preds_obj &lt;- predict(model_fit, \n                          calib_dat[, -which(names(calib_dat) == 'outcome_var')], \n                          probability = TRUE) \n  # e1071 has a funky predict output; just getting probabilities \n  cal_preds &lt;- as.data.frame(attr(cal_preds_obj, 'probabilities')[, 2])\n  # Create calibration model\n  cal_obs_preds_df = data.frame(y = calib_dat$outcome_var, yhat = cal_preds[, 1])\n  calib_model &lt;- glm(y ~ yhat, data = cal_obs_preds_df, family = binomial) \n\n  # Recalibrate classifiers predicted probabilities on the test set   \n  colnames(test_preds) &lt;- c(\"yhat\")\n  recal_preds = predict(calib.model, test_preds, type='response')   \n\n  return(recal_preds)\n\n}\n\nSee Istotonic Regression for “model_fit”, “calib_dat”, “test_preds”, and “test_dat”\n\nExample: AdaBoost in py\nX_, X_test, y_, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\nX_train, X_calib, y_train, y_calib = train_test_split(X_, y_, test_size=0.4, random_state=42)\n\n# uncalibrated model\nclf = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=50)\ny_proba = clf.fit(X_train, y_train).predict_proba(X_test)\n\n# calibrated model\ncalibrator = LogisticRegression()\ncalibrator.fit(clf.predict_proba(X_calib), y_calib)\ny_proba_calib = calibrator.predict_proba(y_proba)\n\nIsotonic Regression\n\nMore complex, requires a lot more data (otherwise it may overfit), but can support reliability diagrams with different shapes (is nonparametric).\n\nTried on palmer penguins (n = 332) and almost all the probabilites were pushed to the edges\nTried on mlbench::PimaIndiansDiabetes (n = 768). Probabilites were mostly clumped into 3 modes.\nPaper used a simulated (n = 5000) dataset. Probabilities moved a little more towards the center but the movement was much less dramatic that the other two datasets.\nI didn’t calculate brier scores but I’d guess you’d need over a 1000 or so observations for this method to have a significantly positive effect.\n\nLacks continuousness, because the fitted regression function is a piecewise function.\n\nSo, a slight change in the uncalibrated predictions can result in dramatic difference in the calibrated predictions (i.e. a change in step)\n\nProcess\n\nSplits: train (50%), Calibration (25%), Test (25%)\nTrain classifier model on train data\nGet predictions from the classifier on the test data\nCreate calibration model dataset from the calibration data\n\nGet predictions from the classifier on the calibration data\nCreate df with observed outcome of calibration data and predictions on calibration data\nOrder df rows according the predictions column\n\nLowest to largest probabilities in the paper but I’m not sure it matters\n\n\nFIt calibration model\n\nFit isotonic regression model on calibration model dataset\nCreate a step function using the isotonic regression fitted values and the predictions on the calibration data\n\nCalibrate the classifier’s predictions on the test set with the step function\n\nExample: SVM in R\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(e1071)\ndata(PimaIndiansDiabetes, package = \"mlbench\")\n\n# isoreg doesn't handle NAs\n# e1071::svm doesn't identify the event correctly in non-0/1 factor variables\ndat_clean &lt;- \n  PimaIndiansDiabetes %&gt;% \n  mutate(diabetes = ifelse(as.numeric(diabetes) == 2, 1, 0)) %&gt;% \n  rename(outcome_var = diabetes) %&gt;% \n  tidyr::drop_na()\n\n# Data splits Training, Calibration, Test (50% - 25% - 25%)\nsmp_size &lt;- floor(0.50 * nrow(dat_clean))\nval_smp_size = floor(0.25 * nrow(dat_clean))\ntrain_idx &lt;- sample(seq_len(nrow(dat_clean)), size = smp_size)\ntrain_dat &lt;- dat_clean[train_idx, ]\ntest_val_dat &lt;- dat_clean[-train_idx, ]\nval_idx &lt;- sample(seq_len(nrow(test_val_dat)), size = val_smp_size)\ncalib_dat &lt;- test_val_dat[val_idx, ]\ntest_dat &lt;- test_val_dat[-val_idx, ]\nrm(list=setdiff(ls(), c(\"train_dat\", \"calib_dat\", \"test_dat\")))\n\n# Fit classifier;

    "text": "Apache Arrow\n\nto_duckdb() and to_arrow(): Converts between using {arrow} engine and {duckdb} engieg in workflow without paying any cost to (re)serialize the data when you pass it back and forth\n\nUseful in cases where something is supported in one of Arrow or DuckDB but not the other\n\nBenefits\n\nUtilization of a parallel vectorized execution engine without requiring any extra data copying\nLarger Than Memory Analysis: Since both libraries support streaming query results, we are capable of executing on data without fully loading it from disk. Instead, we can execute one batch at a time. This allows us to execute queries on data that is bigger than memory.\nComplex Data Types: DuckDB can efficiently process complex data types that can be stored in Arrow vectors, including arbitrarily nested structs, lists, and maps.\nAdvanced Optimizer: DuckDB’s state-of-the-art optimizer can push down filters and projections directly into Arrow scans. As a result, only relevant columns and partitions will be read, allowing the system to e.g., take advantage of partition elimination in Parquet files. This significantly accelerates query execution.\n\nExample (using a SQL Query; method 1)\n# open dataset\nds &lt;- arrow::open_dataset(dir_out, partitioning = \"species\")\n# open connection to DuckDB\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())\n# register the dataset as a DuckDB table, and give it a name\nduckdb::duckdb_register_arrow(con, \"my_table\", ds)\n# query\ndbGetQuery(con, \"\n  SELECT sepal_length, COUNT(*) AS n\n  FROM my_table\n  WHERE species = 'species=setosa'\n  GROUP BY sepal_length\n\")\n\n# clean up\nduckdb_unregister(con, \"my_table\")\ndbDisconnect(con)\n\nfiltering using a partition, the WHERE format is ‘&lt;partition_variable&gt;=&lt;partition_value&gt;’\n\nExample (using SQL Query; method 2)\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Reads Parquet File to an Arrow Table\narrow_table &lt;- arrow::read_parquet(\"integers.parquet\", as_data_frame = FALSE)\n\n# Gets Database Connection\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())\n\n# Registers arrow table as a DuckDB view\narrow::to_duckdb(arrow_table, table_name = \"arrow_table\", con = con)\n\n# we can run a SQL query on this and print the result\nprint(dbGetQuery(con, \"SELECT SUM(data) FROM arrow_table WHERE data &gt; 50\"))\n\n# Transforms Query Result from DuckDB to Arrow Table\nresult &lt;- dbSendQuery(con, \"SELECT * FROM arrow_table\")\nExample (using dplyr)\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Open dataset using year,month folder partition\nds &lt;- arrow::open_dataset(\"nyc-taxi\", partitioning = c(\"year\", \"month\"))\n\nds %&gt;%\n  # Look only at 2015 on, where the number of passenger is positive, the trip distance is\n  # greater than a quarter mile, and where the fare amount is positive\n  filter(year &gt; 2014 & passenger_count &gt; 0 & trip_distance &gt; 0.25 & fare_amount &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  # Pass off to DuckDB\n  to_duckdb() %&gt;%\n  group_by(passenger_count) %&gt;%\n  mutate(tip_pct = tip_amount / fare_amount) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    fare_amount = mean(fare_amount, na.rm = TRUE),\n    tip_amount = mean(tip_amount, na.rm = TRUE),\n    tip_pct = mean(tip_pct, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(passenger_count) %&gt;%\n  collect()\n\nIn the docs, the example has to_duckdb after the group_by. Not sure if that makes a difference in speed. \n\nExample (Streaming Data)\n# Reads dataset partitioning it in year/month folder\nnyc_dataset = open_dataset(\"nyc-taxi/\", partitioning = c(\"year\", \"month\"))\n\n# Gets Database Connection\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())\n\n# We can use the same function as before to register our arrow dataset\nduckdb::duckdb_register_arrow(con, \"nyc\", nyc_dataset)\n\nres &lt;- dbSendQuery(con, \"SELECT * FROM nyc\", arrow = TRUE)\n# DuckDB's queries can now produce a Record Batch Reader\nrecord_batch_reader &lt;- duckdb::duckdb_fetch_record_batch(res)\n\n# Which means we can stream the whole query per batch.\n# This retrieves the first batch\ncur_batch &lt;- record_batch_reader$read_next_batch()",

A combination of a file system and parameters. A package that rolls up everything you need to run an application.\n\nComposed of stacked layers where the layers are self-contained files\nYou can download, build, and run image, but they cannot be changed (immutable)\n\nYou can have many running containers of the same image.\nDocker Hub is a registry for docker repositories.

Think a space also does the same thing, but you can’t see it in the code.\nThe ordering of the inputs in the dockerfile will affect its size and efficiency\n\nThe source code is much more likely to change in the future than the package dependencies. Therefore even though there would be fewer COPY commands, it’s best to install the dependencies before copying the source code.\nWhenever changes to the source code occur Docker has a caching mechanism, so that it doesn’t rebuild everything above the layer where the changes occur.

After the dependencies are built, the build dependencies get deleted.\nThis image with include the sql db and that db has build dependencies. They get deleted\n\nI think it’s 1., but I dunno.

It also has an ENTRYPOINT, so that if you have other projects that use a postgres sql db, they can gain access to that information through the entry point.\nRunning a db migration after a container starts\n\nrun_db_migration1 as environment variable but with a default value set to off.

    "text": "Inheritance\n\n\nSome notes from this much more detailed example (article)\n\nShows how to combine different scripts  (aka modules) and diagram the hierarchies\nSome good debugging too\n\nRunning &lt;class&gt;.__mro__will show you the order of inheritance.\n\n\nInheritance models what is called an “is a” relationship. This means that when you have a Derived (aka subclass, child) class that inherits from a Base (aka super, parent) class, you created a relationship where Derived is a specialized version of Base.\nChild classes inherit all of their parent’s attributes and methods, but they can also define their own attributes and methods.\nCan override or extend parent class attributes and methods\nclass Manager(Employee):\n    pass\n\nm1 = Manager(\"aaa\", 13000)\n\nManager is the child class and Employee is the parent class (see top)\nChild classes don’t require a constructor method for an object to be created\n\nExtending the instance attributes of the parent class\nclass Manager(Employee):\n    def __init__(self, name, salary=0, department):\n        Employee.__init__(self, name, salary=0)\n        self.department = department\n\nContructor method for the child class with the new attribute, “department,” in the arguments.\nParent class (Employee) constructor method is called and a new attribute, department, is defined.\n\n\n\nsuper()\n\nAlternative way of extending instance attributes through inheritance\nExample\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, length, width):\n        self.length = length\n        self.width = width\n    def area(self):\n        return self.length * self.width\n    def perimeter(self):\n        return 2 * self.length + 2 * self.width\nclass Square(Rectangle):\n    def __init__(self, length):\n        super().__init__(length, length)\nclass Cube(Square):\n    def surface_area(self):\n        face_area = super().area()\n        return face_area * 6\n    def volume(self):\n        face_area = super().area()\n        return face_area * self.length\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cube = Cube(3)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cube.surface_area()\n54\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cube.volume()\n27\n\nClass Cube inherits from Square and extends the functionality of .area() (inherited from the Rectangle class through Square) to calculate the surface area and volume of a Cube instance Also notice that the Cube class definition does not have an .__init__(). Because Cube inherits from Square and .__init__() doesn’t really do anything differently for Cube than it already does for Square, you can skip defining it, and the .__init__() of the other child class (Square) will be called automatically.\nsuper(Square, self).__init__(length, length) is equivalent to calling super without parameters (see above example)\nUsing super(Square, self).area() in class Cube. Setting the 1st parameter to Square instead of Cube causes super() to start searching for a matching method (in this case, .area()) at one level above Square in the instance hierarchy, in this case Rectangle.\n\nIf Square had an .area method, but you wanted to use Rectangle’s instead, this would be a way to do that.\n\nNote another difference between using super() and using the class name (e.g. the first example) — “self” is NOT one of the args in super()\nExample: Child class of two separate hierarchies\n# Super class\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, length, width, **kwargs):\n        self.length = length\n        self.width = width\n        super().__init__(**kwargs)\n    def area(self):\n        return self.length * self.width\n    def perimeter(self):\n        return 2 * self.length + 2 * self.width\n# Child class: Square class inherits from the Rectangle class\nclass Square(Rectangle):\n    def __init__(self, length, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(length=length, width=length, **kwargs)\n# Child class: Cube class inherits from Square and also from Rectangle classes\nclass Cube(Square):\n    def surface_area(self):\n        face_area = super().area()\n        return face_area * 6\n    def volume(self):\n        face_area = super().area()\n        return face_area * self.length\n\n# Class (separate)\nclass Triangle: \n    def __init__(self, base, height, **kwargs): \n        self.base = base \n        self.height = height \n        super().__init__(**kwargs) \n    def tri_area(self): \n        return 0.5 * self.base * self.height\n\n# Inherits from a child class (and super class) and a class\nclass RightPyramid(Square, Triangle):\n    def __init__(self, base, slant_height, **kwargs):\n        self.base = base\n        self.slant_height = slant_height\n        kwargs[\"height\"] = slant_height\n        kwargs[\"length\"] = base\n        super().__init__(base=base, **kwargs)\n    def area(self):\n        base_area = super().area()\n        perimeter = super().perimeter()\n        return 0.5 * perimeter * self.slant_height + base_area\n    def area_2(self):\n        base_area = super().area()\n        triangle_area = super().tri_area()\n        return triangle_area * 4 + base_area\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pyramid = RightPyramid(base=2, slant_height=4)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pyramid.area()\n20.0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pyramid.area_2()\n20.0\n\nRightPyramid inherits from a child class (Square) and a class Triangle\n\nSince Square inherits from Rectangle, so does RightPyramid\nTriangle is a separate class not part of any hierarchy\n\nIf there’s an .area method in either of the classes, then super will search hierarchy of the class listed first (Square), then the hierarchy of the class listed second (Triangle)\n\nBest practice to make sure each class has different method names.\n\nEach class with an __init__ constructor gets a super().__init__() and **kwargs added to its args\n\nWhich is every class sans Cube. If Cube was inherited by a class, I think it would require an __init__ constructor and the super().__init__(**kwargs) expression.\nWithout doing this, calling .area_2() in RightPyramid will give us an AttributeError since .base and .height don’t have any values. (don’t completely understand this explanation)\n\nkwarg flow through super().__init__()\n\nIn RightPyramid __init__,  slant_height and base values are assigned to height and length keys in the kwargs dict\nsuper() passes base and the kwargs dict up to Square and Triangle\n\nTriangle uses height from kwargs and base\nSquare uses length from kwargs\n\nSquare passes length to Rectangle as values for both width and length\n\n\nAll classes now have the argument values necessary for their functions to work.\n\nNow RightPyramid can call those other classes’ methods (e.g. .area and .perimeter from Rectangle and tri_area from Triangle)\n\nI believe since every class has **kwargs arg in their super().__init__, each has every value in the kwarg dict even if they don’t need it.\n\nSo probably possible to add functions to those classes that would use those values\n\n\n\nExample: Using super with method other than __init__\nclass SalaryPolicy: \n    def __init__(self, weekly_salary): \n        self.weekly_salary = weekly_salary \n    def calculate_payroll(self): \n        return self.weekly_salary\n\nclass CommissionPolicy(SalaryPolicy): \n    def __init__(self, weekly_salary, commission): \n        super().__init__(weekly_salary) \n        self.commission = commission \n    def calculate_payroll(self): \n        fixed = super().calculate_payroll() \n        return fixed + self.commission\n\nIn CommissionPolicy’s calculate_payroll, super() accesses SalaryPolicy’s calculate_payroll method to get the weekly_salary value\n\n\n\n\n\nDiamond Problem\n\n\nAppears when you’re using multiple inheritance and deriving from two classes that have a common base class.\n\nThis can cause the wrong version of a method to be called.\ne.g. TemporarySecretary uses multiple inheritance to derive from two classes that ultimately also derive from Employee. This causes two paths to reach the Employee base class, which is something you want to avoid in your designs.\n\n\n\n\nMixin Class\n\nOperates the same as Inheritance, but since it only provides simple behavior(s), it is easy to reuse with other classes without causing problems\nExample: Take certain class attributes and create a dict\n# In representations.py\nclass AsDictionaryMixin:\n    def to_dict(self):\n        return {\n            prop: self._represent(value)\n            for prop, value in self.__dict__.items()\n            if not self._is_internal(prop)\n        }\n    def _represent(self, value):\n        if isinstance(value, object):\n            if hasattr(value, 'to_dict'):\n                return value.to_dict()\n            else:\n                return str(value)\n        else:\n            return value\n    def _is_internal(self, prop):\n        return prop.startswith('_')\n\nto_dict is a dictionary comprehension\n\nmydict = {key:val for key, val in dict}\nReturns a dict with key:value (e.g. property (aka attribute):value) pairs from a class’s __dict__ if the property (prop) doesn’t have an underscore\n\n_represent makes sure the “value” is a value and not object\n_is_interna1 checks whether the attribute has an underscore in the name\n\nApply the Mixin class to any class the same way as using Inheritance\nclass Employee(AsDictionaryMixin):\n    def __init__(self, id, name, address, role, payroll):\n        self.id = id\n        self.name = name\n        self.address = address\n        self._role = role\n        self._payroll = payroll\n\nAsDicitionaryMixin is used as an arg to the class\n“self._role” and “self._payroll” have underscores which tells to_dict not to include them in the resulting dictionary\nNot important to using a mixin class but note that “address” is from the Address class via composition (see below). Therefore the Address class would also need to inherit AsDictionaryMixin for this to work\n\nUtilize\nimport json\n\ndef print_dict(d):\n    print(json.dumps(d, indent=2))\n\nfor employee in EmployeeDatabase().employees:\n    print_dict(employee.to_dict())\n\nprint_dict takes the dict output of employee._to_dict and converts it to a json format",

    "text": "Composition\n\n\nNotes from Inheritance and Composition: A Python OOP Guide\nComposition models a “has a” relationship. In composition, a class known as composite contains an object of another class known to as component.\nComposition design is typically more flexible than inheritance and is preferable to Inheritance\n\nPrevents “class explosion”\n\nFor complex projects, too many classes can lead to conflicts and errors because of the inevitable complex network of classes that are connected to each other.\nYou change your program’s behavior by providing new components that implement those behaviors instead of adding new classes to your hierarchy.\n\nOnly loose class connections in composition\n\nChanges to the component class rarely affect the composite class, and changes to the composite class never affect the component class\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nClasses are written in different py scripts and imported as “modules” in another script.\nAttribute(s) from a component class (e.g. Address) are used in the composite class (e.g. Employee)\nThen a composite class attribute object is assigned to the instantiated composite class’s empty attribute\n\nThis is the magic. One class’s attribute can be used as input into another class’s attribute without being tightly coupled to that other class (aka inheritance).\n\nThat input isn’t a value. It’s class type object.\nSee Utilize code block below\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition Through __init__ Attributes\n\nExample:\n# In contacts.py\n# Component class\nclass Address:\n    def __init__(self, street, city, state, zipcode, street2=''):\n        self.street = street\n        self.street2 = street2\n        self.city = city\n        self.state = state\n        self.zipcode = zipcode\n\n# In employees.py\n# Composite class\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, id, name):\n        self.id = id\n        self.name = name\n        self.address = None\n\n# ManagerRole and SalaryPolicy are classes from different modules\nclass Manager(Employee, ManagerRole, SalaryPolicy):\n    def __init__(self, id, name, weekly_salary):\n        SalaryPolicy.__init__(self, weekly_salary)\n        super().__init__(id, name)\n\nYou would import these two modules into a third script and do stuff (see next code block)\nYou initialize the Address.address attribute to “None” for now to make it optional, but by doing that, you can now assign an Address to an Employee.\n\ni.e. the attributes of an Address instance from its __init__ are now available to be assigned to a Employee instance.\n\nManager is a child class of multiple other classes (inheritance) including Employee and therefore gets an .address attribute\n\nAside: ManagerRole doesn’t have an __init__ (i.e. no attributes), so I’m not sure why super() is used here\n\nwhy not just use Employee.__init__?\nI would’ve thought that ManagerRole would’ve required the same inputs as Employee, so super() is used here to cover both at the same time.\n\nBut that’s not the case, MangerRole is there just for it’s method and not it’s attributes\n\nDoes being able to use ManageRole methods require super() (i.e. necessary for Inheritance)?\n\n\nUtilize\nmanager = employees.Manager(1, 'Mary Poppins', 3000)\nmanager.address = contacts.Address(\n    '121 Admin Rd', \n    'Concord', \n    'NH', \n    '03301'\n)\n# ... create other intances of different jobs in the company\n\n# guess this would be like a json\nemployees = [\n    manager,\n    secretary,\n    sales_guy,\n    factory_worker,\n    temporary_secretary,\n]\n\n# do work with the list class objs\nproductivity_system = productivity.ProductivitySystem()\nproductivity_system.track(employees, 40)\n\nThe Address class instance is assigned to the .address attribute of the Manager instance (which gets its .address attribute from Employee)\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition Through a Function Argument\n\nExample:\n# In hr.py\nclass PayrollSystem:\n    def calculate_payroll(self, employees):\n        print('Calculating Payroll')\n        print('===================')\n        for employee in employees:\n            print(f'Payroll for: {employee.id} - {employee.name}')\n            print(f'- Check amount: {employee.calculate_payroll()}')\n            if employee.address:\n                print('- Sent to:')\n                print(employee.address)\n            print('')\n\npayroll_system = hr.PayrollSystem()\npayroll_system.calculate_payroll(employees)\n\nThe input for calculate_payroll, employees, is a list of instantiated Employee class objects in the previous code chunk.\nName of the class is iterated and represents each instance\n\nHas attributes and methods available\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Module Classes Used as Attributes\n\nExample:\n# In employees.py\nfrom productivity import ProductivitySystem\nfrom hr import PayrollSystem\nfrom contacts import AddressBook\nclass EmployeeDatabase:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._employees = [\n            {\n                'id': 1,\n                'name': 'Mary Poppins',\n                'role': 'manager'\n            },\n            {\n                'id': 2,\n                'name': 'John Smith',\n                'role': 'secretary'\n            }\n        ]\n        self.productivity = ProductivitySystem()\n        self.payroll = PayrollSystem()\n        self.employee_addresses = AddressBook()\n    @property\n    def employees(self):\n        return [self._create_employee(**data) for data in self._employees]\n    def _create_employee(self, id, name, role):\n        address = self.employee_addresses.get_employee_address(id)\n        employee_role = self.productivity.get_role(role)\n        payroll_policy = self.payroll.get_policy(id)\n        return Employee(id, name, address, employee_role, payroll_policy)\n\nProductivitySystem, PayrollSystem, AddressBook are classes imported from various modules\nAs attributes, these classes’ methods are used in the _create_employee function\n\nReturn invokes the Employee class with values obtained by the various class methods\nEmployee class (not shown in this block) is already present in this module so it doesn’t have to be imported.",

    "text": "Optimizations\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from How to Write Memory-Efficient Classes in Python\n\nUse __slots__ when creating large numbers of instances\n\n\nBy default, Python classes store their instance attributes in a private dictionary (__dict__), which dictionary allows you to add, modify, or delete the class attributes at runtime, but it creates a large memory burden when substantial numbers of instances are created.\nSlots reserves only a fixed amount of space for the specified attributes directly in each instance, instead of using the default dictionary.\nAny attempt to assign an attribute that is not listed in __slots__ will raise an AttributeError.\n\nThis can help prevent creating accidental attributes due to typos, but it can also be restrictive if you need to add additional attributes later in development.\n\nExample:\nclass Ant:\n  __slots__ = ['worker_id', 'role', 'colony']\n\n  def __init__(self, worker_id, role, colony):\n      self.worker_id = worker_id\n      self.role = role\n      self.colony = colony\n\nLazy Initialization for memory intensive operations\n\nScenario: Data Loading in an app\n\nUser wants to look at map or examine features before analyzing data.\nWithout Lazy Loading, the entire dataset is loaded upfront, leading to slower startup and potentially exceeding memory limits.\n\nCaching is also a good idea if you’re performing the same intensive computation more than once.\nExample: Lazy Loader\nfrom functools import cached_property\n\nclass DataLoader:\n\n    def __init__(self, path):\n        self.path = path\n\n    @cached_property\n    def dataset(self):\n        # load the dataset here\n        # this will only be executed once when the dataset property is first accessed\n        return self._load_dataset()\n\n    def _load_dataset(self):\n        print(\"Loading the dataset...\")\n\n        # load a big dataset here\n        df = pd.read_csv(self.path)\n        return df\n\nclass DataProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, path):\n          self.path = path\n        self.data_loader = DataLoader(self.path)\n\n    def process_data(self):\n        dataset = self.data_loader.dataset\n        print(\"Processing the dataset...\")\n        # Perform complex data processing steps on the loaded dataset\n        ...\n\n# instantiate the DataLoader class\npath = \"/[path_to_dataset]/mnist.csv\"\n\n# instantiate the DataProcessor class with the data file path\n# 👉 no data will be loaded at this stage! ✅\nprocessor = DataProcessor(path)\n\n# trigger the processing\nprocessor.process_data()  # The dataset will be loaded and processed when needed\n\nUse generators to reduce memory usage of loops\n\nSee Python, General &gt;&gt; Loops &gt;&gt; Generators\n\nAlso, in Loops &gt;&gt; Misc, there’s a chart that shows the memory benefits to using a generator vs list comprehension.",

In which case the 10% may actually be pretty normal? Or was the change lower? Higher?\n\nIs this change seasonal? Do we see the same spike around this time each year?\n\nExample: Does WhatsApp see a spike in messages sent during the holiday season?\n\nWas the change sudden or gradual? Did we see a sudden spike or drop overnight? Or has the metric gradually been moving in this direction over time?\n\nExample: If product usage jumps by 50% overnight could there be a bug in our logging systems?\n\nAre there specific times during the day or week where this change is more pronounced?\n\nSolution examples\n\nIf the change is seasonal then there may not necessarily be anything you need to ‘solve’ for. But, you can leverage this to your advantage.\n\nExample: Amazon sales may jump up on Black Friday so they would want to make sure they have the proper infrastructure in place so the site doesn’t crash. They may also see if there are certain types of products that are popular purchases and increase their inventory accordingly.\n\nIf there is a sudden decline, there may be a bug in the logging or a new feature or update recently launched that’s creating problems that you may need to roll back.\nIf there’s a gradual decline, it may indicate a change in user behavior.\n\nExample: If the time spent listening to music is declining because people prefer to listen to podcasts then Spotify may want to focus more of their content inventory on podcasts.\n\n\n\nRegion\n\nWhat to explore\n\nIs this change concentrated in a specific region or do we see a similar change across the board?\n\nSolution examples\n\nThere may be newly enforced regulations in countries that are affecting your product metrics. You would need to do further research to assess the impacts of these regulations and potential workarounds.\n\nExample: Uber was temporarily banned in London in 2019 for repeated safety failures which resulted in a series of lawsuits and court cases.\n\nPopular local events may also be potential explanations. While these may not be areas to ‘solve’ for they can be opportunities to take advantage of.\n\nExample: Coachella season means a jump in the number of Airbnb bookings in Southern California that are capitalized on by surge pricing.\n\n\n\nOther Internal Products\n\nWhat to explore\n\nIs this change specific to one product or is it company-wide? How does this metric vary across our other product offerings?\n\nExample: If the Fundraising feature on Facebook is seeing increased usage, is the swipe up to donate feature on Instagram (which Facebook owns) also seeing a similar uptick?\n\nAre there other metrics that have also changed in addition to the one in question?\n\nExample: If the time spent on Uber is going down, is the number of cancellations by drivers also declining (implying people are spending less time on the app because they’re having a more reliable experience)?\n\n\nSolution examples\n\nIf there is a metric change across our other features and products, it’s likely a larger problem we should address with multiple teams and may need a Public Relations consultant.\n\nExample: Elon + Twitter.\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\nWhat to explore\n\nMobile vs Desktop?\nMac vs Windows?\nAndroid vs iOS?\n\nSolution examples\n\nIf there was a positive change in our metric on a specific platform (e.g. iOS) and coincides with an (iOS) update we released, we would want to do a retrospective to determine what about that update was favorable so we can double down on it. Alternatively, if the metric change was negative, we may want to reconsider and even roll back the update.\nIf the change was due to a change in the platform experience (e.g. app store placement, ratings) we may want to seek advice from our marketing team since this is a top of the funnel problem\nIf users are showing astrong preference for a specific platform, we want to make sure that the experience of the preferred platform is up to par. We also need to make sure our platform-specific monetization strategies are switching to follow the trend.\n\nExample: Facebook’s ad model was initially tied to the desktop app only and had to be expanded as mobile became the platform of preference.\n\n\n\nIndustry & Competitors\n\nWhat to explore\n\nWhen our decline began, was there a new competitor or category that emerged?\n\nExample: Did the number of users listening to Apple podcasts go down when Clubhouse came on to the scene?\n\nHave competitors changed their offering lately?\nIs the category as a whole declining?\n\nSolution examples\n\nIf the category is shifting as a whole, we should begin looking at larger-scale changes to the app.\n\nExample: What Kodak should have done.\n\nIf there’s a new competitor taking our market share, we can begin with reactivation campaigns on churned users. We may also want to conduct user research to understand the gap between our offering and those of our competitors\n\n\nCannibalization\n\nWhat to explore\n\nAre other products or features in our offering experiencing growth in the face of our decline or vice versa?\nHave we released a new feature that is drawing users away from our old features? If so, can we fully attribute the release of the new feature with the decline in the metric of our feature in question?\n\nExample: When Facebook released reactions, did the number of comments on a post go down because people found it easier to press a react button instead of writing a comment?\n\n\nSolution examples\n\nCannibalization may not necessarily be a bad thing. We need to determine whether this shift in user interest across our features is favorable by determining whether the new features align better with the goals of the business.\nCannibalization may also be an indication of but it is indicative of a change in user behavior. In which case we may want to consider if perhaps our core metrics need to change as user behaviors change.\n\nExample: If users care more about watching Instagram stories than engaging with the Instagram feed we may want to optimize for retention (because the ephemeral nature of stories is more likely to motivate users to keep coming back to the platform) instead of time spent on the app.\n\nWe can also look at ways to bridge the two features together to create a more unified platform.\n\n\nSegmentation\n\nWhat to explore\n\nHow does this metric vary by user type:\n\nAge, sex, education\nPower users versus casual users * New users versus existing users\n\nHow does this metric vary by different attributes of the product:\n\nExample: If the time spent watching YouTube videos is going down, is it across longer videos or shorter clips? Is it only for DIY videos or interview tutorial content? Is the same number of people that started watching a video the same but a large chunk of them stop watching it halfway through?\n\n\nSolution examples\n\nIf the metric varies between new and existing users then maybe there is a overcrowding effect.\n\nExample: Reddit forums could hit a critical mass where new users feel lost and less likely to engage than existing users resulting in a drop in engagements per user\n\nIf users are dropping off at certain parts of the funnel then maybe the experience at that funnel step is broken.\n\nExample: While the same number of people are starting carts on Amazon there may be a drop in purchases if the payment verification system isn’t working.",

Should they be listening to audiobooks and is there anything we should do about it?\n\nActionable: Users under the age of 25 hardly use audiobooks because they never explore the feature in the app. However users who listen to audiobooks have a 20% higher retention rate.\n\nThis information tells us that audiobooks represent a potential opportunity to increase retention amongst younger users, however there seems to be more work to be done to encourage users exploring this feature.\n\nSteps\n\nProblem Statement: High-level business problem to solve (e.g. Increasing Retention, Conversion Rate, Average Order Value)\n\nCan also be in regards to a metric that’s believed to be highly associated with a North Star metric like a Primary metric (See KPIs)\n\nOpportunity Areas: Areas or problems with a strong connection to the problem at hand\n\nInvestigate behaviors of users with the behavior that you’re interested in (i.e. high or low values of the desired metric).\nDiscovering the characteristics of these users can help to figure out ways to encourage other users to act similarily or gain insight into the type of users you want to attract.\n\nLevers: Different ways to work on the opportunity areas\n\nA lever should be data-based and able to be validated on whether working to increase or decrease the lever will lead to a positive solution to the problem statement.\nThere are typically multiple levers for a given opportunity area\n\nThese should be ordered in terms of priority, and priority should be given to the lever that is believed to result in the greatest impact on the opportunity area that will result in the greatest impact on the solution to the problem statement.\n\n\nExperiments [Optional]: Concrete implementation of a specific lever that can help prove/disprove our hypotheses.\n\nOptional but always helpful to convey recommendations and suggestions with concrete ideas for what the team could or should be building.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nProblem Statement: How can we increase daily listening time for premium users in the Spotify app?\n\nHypothesis: Daily Listening Time is strongly connected to retention for premium users and hensce to monthly revenue.\n\nOpportunity Areas:\n\nUsers who use auto-generated playlists have a x% higher daily listening time\nUsers who subscribed to at least 3 podcasts have a x% higher listening time per day than those who did not subscribe to any.\nUsers who listen to audiobooks have a x% higher daily listening time.\n\nLevers:\n\nOpportunity Area: Increase the percentage of users under 25 using audiobooks from x% to y%.\nQuestions:\n\nDo users not see the feature?\nDo users see the feature but don’t engage with the feature?\nDo users engage with the feature but drop off after a short amount of time?\n\nFinding: Users under 25 engage less with the Home Screen, the only screen where Audiobooks are promoted, and hence don’t see this feature in the App. This is likely leading low usage and engagement.\nLever: Increase prominence of Audiobooks within the app\nPrioritzation Table for Report\n\n\nExperiments:\n\n\n“We predict that adding a banner promoting Audiobooks when the App opens [Experiment Change] will increase younger users’ daily listening time [Problem] because more younger users will see and listen to Audiobooks [Lever]. We will know this is true when we see an increase in young users using Audiobooks [Lever], followed by an increase in the daily listening time for younger users [Validation Metrics].”\nIf there is no significant increase in audiobook usage, then there many other ways to increase the visibility of a feature which can be the hypotheses of further experiments.\nIf , however, there is a significant increase in users using Audiobooks (lever) but no effect on daily listening time (main problem), then the lever is invalidated and we can move on to the next one.",

It’s suited for situations where you’re interested in group-level comparisons (e.g., comparing the average test scores of students from different schools).\nRegression, on the other hand, is used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It’s suitable for predicting or explaining a continuous outcome variable.\n\nData Type:\n\nANOVA is traditionally used with categorical independent variables and a continuous dependent variable. It helps assess whether the categorical variable has a significant impact on the continuous variable.\n\nThere are other variants such as ANCOVA (categorical and continuous IVs) and Analysis of Deviance (discrete outcome)\n\nRegression can be used with both categorical and continuous independent variables to predict a continuous dependent variable or to examine the relationship between variables.\n\nMultiple Factors:\n\nANOVA is designed to handle situations with multiple categorical independent variables (factors) and their interactions. It is useful when you are interested in understanding the combined effects of several factors.\nRegression can accommodate multiple independent variables as well, but it focuses on predicting the value of the dependent variable rather than comparing groups.\n\nHypothesis Testing:\n\nANOVA tests for differences in means among groups and provides p-values to determine whether those differences are statistically significant.\nRegression can be used for hypothesis testing, but it’s more often used for estimating the effect size and making predictions.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nANOVA assumes that the groups are independent and that the residuals (the differences between observed values and group means) are normally distributed and have equal variances.\nRegression makes similar assumptions about residuals but also assumes a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables.",

    "text": "General\n\nFamily of procedures which summarizes the relationship between the underlying model and the outcome by partitioning the variation in the outcome into components which can be uniquely attributable to different sources according to the law of total variance.\nEssentially, each of the model’s terms is represented in a line in the ANOVA table which answers the question how much of the variation in Y can be attributed to the variation in X?\n\nWhere applicable, each source of variance has an accompanying test statistic (oftenF), sometimes called the omnibus test, which indicates the significance of the variance attributable to that term, often accompanied by some measure of effect size.\n\nOne-Way ANOVA - 1 categorical, independent variable\n\nDetermines whether there is a statistically significant difference in the means of the dependent variable across the different levels of the independent variable.\nExample: A researcher wants to compare the average plant height grown using three different types of fertilizer. They would use a one-way ANOVA to test if there is a significant difference in height between the groups fertilized with each type.\n\nTwo-Way ANOVA - 2 categorical, independent variables\n\nExample: 3 treatments are given to subjects and the researcher thinks that females and males will have different responses in general.\n\nTest whether there are treatment differences after accounting for sex effects\nTest whether there are sex differences after accounting for treatment effects\nTest whether the treatment effect is different for females and males if you allow the treatment \\(\\times\\) sex interaction to be in the model\n\n\nTypes\n\nTL;DR;\n\nI don’t see a reason not to run type III every time.\nType I: Sequential Attribution of Variation\nType II: Simultaneous Attribution of Variation\n\nFor interactions: Sequential-Simultaneous Attribution of Variation\n\nType III: Simultaneous Attribution of Variation for Main Effects and Interactions\nIf the categorical explanatory variables in the analysis are balanced, then all 3 types will give the same results. The results for each variable will be it’s unique contribution.\n\nExample:\n# balanced\ntable(d$Rx, d$condition)\n#&gt;           Ca Cb\n#&gt;   Placebo  5  5\n#&gt;   Dose100  5  5\n#&gt;   Dose250  5  5\n\n# imbalanced\ntable(d$group, d$condition)\n#&gt;      Ca Cb\n#&gt;   Gb  6  6\n#&gt;   Ga  5  6\n#&gt;   Gc  4  3\n\n\nType I: Sequential Sum of Squares\n\nVariance attribution is calculated sequentially so the order of variables in the model matters. Each term is attributed with a portion of the variation (represented by its SS) that has not yet been attributed to any of the previous terms.\nRarely used in practice because the order in which variation is attributed isn’t usually important\nExample: Order of terms matters\nanova(lm(Y ~ group + X, data = d))\n#&gt; Analysis of Variance Table\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Response: Y\n#&gt;           Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)   \n#&gt; group      2    8783    4391  0.0918 0.912617   \n#&gt; X          1  380471  380471  7.9503 0.009077 **\n#&gt; Residuals 26 1244265   47856                    \n#&gt; ---\n#&gt; Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nanova(lm(Y ~ X + group, data = d))\n#&gt; Analysis of Variance Table\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Response: Y\n#&gt;           Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(&gt;F)  \n#&gt; X          1  325745  325745  6.8067 0.01486 *\n#&gt; group      2   63509   31754  0.6635 0.52353  \n#&gt; Residuals 26 1244265   47856                  \n#&gt; ---\n#&gt; Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nSum of Squares values change based on the order of the terms in the model\nIn the first model,\n\nThe effect of group does not represent its unique contribution to Y’s variance, but instead its total contribution.\n\nThis reminds me of a dual path DAG where group is influenced by X. Here X’s variance contribution is included in group’s contribution since X is not conditioned upon. (See Causal Inference &gt;&gt; Dual Path DAGs)\n\nThe effect of X represents only what X explains after removing the contribution of group — the variance attributed to X is strictly the variance that can be uniquely attributed to X, controlling for group\n\n\n\nType II: Simultaneous Sum of Squares\n\nThe variance attributed to each variable is its unique contribution — variance after controlling for the other variables. Order of terms does not matter.\nExample\ncar::Anova(m, type = 2)\n#&gt; Anova Table (Type II tests)\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Response: Y\n#&gt;            Sum Sq Df F value   Pr(&gt;F)   \n#&gt; group       63509  2  0.6635 0.523533   \n#&gt; X          380471  1  7.9503 0.009077 **\n#&gt; Residuals 1244265 26                    \n#&gt; ---\n#&gt; Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nSum of Squares values are equal to values of the Type 1 results when each variable is last.\nNote that factor variables, e.g. group, are treated as 1 term and not broken down into dummy variables for each level.\n\nWith interactions, the method of calculation could be called, Sequential-Simultaneous.\n\nTerms are evaluated simultaneously in groups based on type of term, e.g. main effects, 2-way interactions, 3-way interactions, etc., but sequentially according to the order of that term where the order of main effects &lt; 2-way interactions &lt; 3-way interactions, etc.\nAll main effects (1st order) are tested simultaneously (accounting for one another), then all 2-way interactions (2nd order) are tested simultaneously (accounting for the main effects and one another), and finally the 3-way interaction is tested (accounting for all main effects and 2-way interactions).\nSo, if you use this way to test a model with interactions, only the highest order term’s Sum of Squares represents a unique variance contribution.\n\n\nType III: Simultaneous-Simultaneous Sum of Squares\n\nThe Sum-of-Squares for each main effect and interaction is calculated as its unique contribution (i.e. takes into account all other terms of the model).\nUnlike Type II, it allows you compare variance contributions for every term in your model.\nWithout centering continuous variables and applying sum-to-zero contrasts to categorical variables, tests results can change depending on the categorical level of the moderator.

These are people in the organization that are close to process and customers. We need to understand what are the potential drivers of lead time. Form a general equation that they help create.\n\n\nMeasure Drivers\n\nCollect Data\n\nCollect data related to the high level drivers. This data could be stored in databases or it may need to be collected. We could collect competitor data, supplier data, sales data (Enterprise Resource Planning or ERP data), personnel data, and more.\nMay require effort to set up processes to collect it, but developing strategic data sources becomes a competitive advantage over time.\n\nDevelop KPIs\n\nRequires knowledge of customers and industry. Realize that a wealth of data is available outside of your organization. Learn where this data resides, and it becomes a tremendous asset.\n\n\nUncover Problems And Opportunities\n\nEvaluate performance vs KPIs\nHighlight potential problem areas\nReview the our project for what could have been missed\n\nTalk with SME’s to make sure they agree with your findings so far.\n\n\nEncode Decision Making Algorithms\n\nDevelop algorithms to predict and explain the problem\nOptimize decisions to maximize profit\n\ne.g. For classification, threshold optimization using a custom cost function to optimize resources, costs, precision, and recall (See Diagnostics, Classification &gt;&gt; Scores &gt;&gt; Custom Cost Functions\n\nUse systematic decision-making algorithms to improve decision making\n\nExample: Employee Churn\n\n\nApp uses LIME to get prediction-level feature importance\n\n\nMeasure The Results\n\nCapture outcomes\nSynthesize results\nVisualize outcomes over time\n\nWe are looking for progress. If we have experienced good outcomes, then we need to recognize what contributed to those good outcomes.\nQuestions\n\nWere the decision makers using the tools?\nDid they follow the systematic recommendation?\nDid the model accurately predict risk?\nWere the results poor? Same questions apply.\n\n\n\nReport Financial Impact\n\nMeasure actual results\nTie to financial benefits\nReport financial benefit to key stakeholders\n\nIt’s insufficient to say that we saved 75 employees or 75 customers. Rather, we need to say that the average cost of a lost employee or lost customer is $100,000 per year, so we just saved the organization $7.5M/year. Always report as a financial value.\n\n\n\nExample: Customer Churn\n\nView business as a machine\n\nIsolating business units: The interaction occurs between Sales and the Customer\nDefining objectives: Make customers happy\nCollecting outcomes: We are slowly losing customers. It’s lowering revenue for the organization $500K per year.\n\nUnderstand The Drivers\n\nInvestigate if objectives are being met\n\nCustomer Satisfaction: Loss of customers generally indicates low satisfaction. This could be related to availability of products, poor customer service, or competition offering lower prices and/or better service or quality.\n\nSynthesize outcomes\n\nCustomers are leaving for a competitor. In speaking with Sales, several customers have stated “Competition has faster delivery”. This is an indicator that lead time, or the ability to quickly service customers, is not competitive.\n\nHypothesize Drivers\n\nLead time is related to supplier delivery, inventory availability, personnel, and the scheduling process.\n\n\nMeasure Drivers\n\nAverage Lead Time: The level is 2-weeks, which is based on customer feedback on competitors.\nSupplier Average Lead Time: The level is 3 weeks, which is based on feedback related to our competitor’s suppliers.\nInventory Availability Percentage: The level of 90% is related based on where customers are experiencing unmet demand. This data comes from the ERP data comparing sale requests to product availability.\nPersonnel Turnover: The level of 15% is based on the industry averages.\n\nUncover Problems and Opportunities\n\nOur average lead time is 6 weeks compared to the competitor average lead time of 2 weeks, which is the first order cause for the customer churn\nOur supplier average lead time is on par with our competitor’s, which does not necessitate a concern.\nOur inventory percentage availability is 80%, which is too low to maintain a high customer satisfaction level. This could be a reason that churn is increasing.\nOur personnel turnover in key areas is zero over the past 12 months, so no cause for concern.",

This will help build trust, and keep us all accountable for cultivating great data products and data-driven cultures.\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools: When in doubt, we need to rely on the relationships we’ve built with the business over the tools we’ve put in to help guide those relationships.\n\n\n\nData Science Lifecycle\n\n\nNotes from TDSP: When Agile Meets Data Science\nIf at any point we are not satisfied with our results or faced with changing requirements we can return to a previous step since this methodology is focused on iterative development\nSteps\n\nBusiness Understanding\n\nDefine objectives: Work with customers/stakeholders to identify the business problem we are trying to solve.\nIdentify data sources: Identify the data sources that we will need to solve it.\n\nData Acquisition and Understanding\n\nIngest the data: Bring the data into our environment that we are using for analytics.\nExplore the data: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and determinine if it is adequate for model development.\nSet up a data pipeline: Build a process to ingest new data. A data pipeline can either be batch-based, real-time or a hybrid of the previous options.\nNote: While the data scientists on the team are working on EDA, the data engineers may be working on setting up a data pipeline, which allows us to complete this stage quicker\n\nModeling\n\nFeature engineering: Creat data features from raw data for model training.\n\nEnhanced by having a good understanding of the data.\n\nModel training: Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Train models\nModel evaluation: Evaluate those models by answering the following questions:\n\nWhat are the metrics that the model achieves on the validation/testing set?\nDoes the model solve the business problem and fit the constraints of the problem?\nIs this model suitable for production?\n\nNote: Could train one model and find that the results are not satisfactory and return to the feature engineering and model training stages to craft better features and try different modeling approaches.\n\nDeployment (Options)\n\nExposing the model through an API that can be consumed by other applications.\nCreating a microservice or containerized application that runs the model.\nIntegrating the model into a web application with a dashboard that displays the results of the predictions.\nCreating a batch process that runs the model and writes the predictions to a data source that can be consumed.\n\nStakeholder/customer acceptance\n\nSystem validation: Confirm that the data pipeline, model, and deployment satisfy the business use case and meet the needs of the customers.\nProject hand-off: Transfer the project to the group that will manage it in production. l\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Roadmap Examples\n\nExample\n\nInitiative: build a forecast system to predict sales for an ice cream company\nEpics:\n\n“As a Sales Manager, I need to understand which regions I need to focus my outbound effort based on the sales forecast”\n“As a Logistics Manager, I need to estimate demand so that I can prepare our production accordingly”\n\nUser Story:\n\n“As a Logistics Manager, I need to see the forecast on my Production Dashboard”;\n“As a Logistics Manager, I need to have simulations around how weather predictions can change the forecast”;\n\n\n\n\n\nSprint Workflow\n\n\nBad flow chart, should be a circle where review loops back to planning\nSprint Review - The scrum team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the sprint, what has changed in their environment, and collaborate on what to do next\n\nThese are necessary to avoiding issues that might destroy a project.

    "text": "37.2 General Steps for Starting a Project\n\nFraming a data question\n\nGuidelines\n\nPrecision: Be as detailed as possible in how you frame your questions. Avoid generic words like ‘improve’ or ‘success.’ If you want to improve something, specify by how much. If you want to achieve something, specify by when.\n\nDecide before starting what the minimum project performance is to productionize (i.e. build a fully functional project) and launch (i.e. deliver to all your customers)\n\nSetting these thresholds at the beginning will help to prevent you from bargaining with yourself or stakeholders to deliver the project that might harm your business\n\nAfter working hard on a project and pouring resources into it, it can be difficult to end it.\n\n\n\nData-Centric: Consider the role of data in your organization. Can data help you answer this question? Is it clear what data you will need to collect to answer this question? Can progress on the task be codified into a metric that can be measured? If the answer to any of these questions is ambiguous or negative, investing in additional data resources may be an inefficient allocation of resources.\n\nExample\n\nFigure Out What Data You Need\n\nGuidelines\n\nNecessity: Are the data you are collecting necessary? Avoid data bloat, which is over-collecting data points for a “just in case” scenario. This makes sustaining long-term data collection of those fields far more burdensome.\nAvailability: Are there external, publicly available data sources like government data that you can leverage? If the data needs to be collected, how easy is it to collect? If it is hard to collect, do you have a plan and resources in place as to how you can ensure it is collected at regular intervals over time? One-off data collection is rarely helpful as there is no reference point to measure the impact of interventions over time.\nMaintainability: Can you maintain and easily update this data over time? Is the cost of doing so sustainable? This is critical because longitudinal data collection with standard fields is one of the most valuable resources for a nonprofit. Avoid constantly changing field names, a moving target of data collection objectives, and costly data collection procedures (like purchasing third-party data) that are not sustainable given your overall budget.\nReliability: If you are using a third party data source, do you trust the quality of the data? What are the ways this data may be biased, incomplete, or inaccurate?\n\nExample\n\nA nonprofit with a mission to find long-term housing for the unhoused. This organization may want to answer the question: ’what percentage of the unhoused have we been able to successfully rehabilitate in the area we serve?’\n\n\nOrganizational Buy-in\n\nProject manager tries to examine whether the project can fundamentally be classified as feasible and whether the requirements can be carried out with the available resources.\n\nExpert Interviews: Is the problem in general is very well suited for the deployment of data science and are there corresponding projects that have already been undertaken externally and also published?\nData science team: Are there a sufficient number of potentially suitable methods for this project and are the required data sources are available?\nIT department: check the available infrastructure and the expertise of the involved employees.\n\nMake sure everyone on the team agrees on what data that you want to collect and measure and who owns the data collection process.\nHaving someone of authority or that’s respected in each department involved in the development of the product will go a long way to building trust with users when it’s fully deployed\n\nExample: Demand Forecasting Automation\n\nTeam should consist of Supply Chain department and close collaboration with Sales and IT\n\n\nExample\n\nSuppose teachers at a school are interested in fielding quantitative surveys to track student outcomes, but there exists little incentive for teachers to collect this data on top of regular work. As a result, only one teacher in the school volunteers to design and administer the survey to their class. However, the survey results will now be limited to the students’ experiences and outcomes for just the one class. The measured outcomes will be biased because they will not capture any variance across students from different classes in the school.\n\n\nCalculate How Much Data You Need to Collect\nMake sure you’ve answered these questions\n\nIs the problem definition clear and specific? Are there measurable criteria that define success or failure?\nIs it technically feasible to address the defined problem within the designated timeframe? Is the data required for the envisioned solution approach available?\nDo all relevant stakeholders agree with the problem definition, performance indicators, and selection criteria?\nDoes the intended technical solution resolve the initial business problem?",

Permanent markers will likely cause some unintended permanent damage and thin, ballpoint pens are difficult to read unless you’re right up close to them\n1 white board per group, or alternatively, 2 x large A2 pieces of paper\n\nParticipants\n\nKey business stakeholders involved in the area you’re working on — you need management buy-in if anything is going to happen\nTwo or three people who will actually use the tools or insights you’ll be delivering\nA facilitator (probably you) and a few members of your data science or analytics team\n\nChallenge Identification Workshop\n\nSuited for a situation when the business stakeholders know what their challenges are, but don’t know what you can do for them.\nGoals:\n\nDS: Try to understand the customer pain points as well as you can.\n\nDo not try to develop solutions in this workshop\n\nStakeholders: get as many ideas out as possible in the time allotted.\n\nAdditional Supplies\n\nPoster or slide with user journey, or something similar, depending on the business\n\nHelps to guide participants to home-in on customer pain points\nNeeds to be done before the workshop\nExample\n\n\nProcess\n\nIntroduction\n\nBrief introduction of your team\nBrief 5-minute ‘Best In Class’ slide or two where I look at companies who are currently doing amazing things, preferably in the data science domain, in the area that our stakeholders work\nAddress goal of the workshop (see above for stakeholders)\n\nSplit into two or three groups\n\nIdeally between four to five people per group\nPut senior managers or executives in separate groups\n1 DS or analyst in each group\n\nWrite as many customer pain points as possible (aka Ideation)\n\nDuration: 25–30 minutes\nEverybody writes ideas on sticky note and puts on their board\n\nNo need for whole group to approve of the idea.\n\n“Bad” ideas are weeded out later\n\n\nIf you see themes popping up, go ahead and group similar sticky-notes together\nDS or analyst needs to pay attention to each proposed idea, so as to be able to write a fuller description of the idea later on\n\nIf possible, note the author of each idea so as to be able to ask them questions later if needed.\n\n(You) Walk around to each group\n\nRemind them of the rules (get down as many ideas as possible)\nPrompt them with questions to get more ideation happening within the groups\n\n\nOne member from each of the groups presents their group’s key ideas back to the rest of the room\n\nDuration: 3-5 min per group\n\nPlace similar stickies into groups or themes\nVote on the best ideas\n\nDuration: 3 min\nEveryone gets three dot stickers and is allowed to vote for any ideas\nThey can put all their stickies on one idea or divide them up however they like\nNo discussions\nIf it’s the case that one sticky within a theme of stickies gets all the votes, or even if the votes are all shared equally, consider all of those as votes towards the theme.\n\n\n\nPredefined Problem Sculpting Workshop\n\nThe difference between this approach and the first one is that here the business stakeholders already have an idea about what they need.\n\ne.g a metric of some sort, some kind of customer segmentation or some kind of tool\n\nExample\n\nDevelop ‘affluency score’ for each banking customer.\n\nGoal: Answer 2 questions\n\nWhat is it that we’re trying to do?\n\nDefining what it is you’re trying to do will help to define what is meant by the metric/segment/measure you’re developing.\nFrom example (see Goal above), it’s vital that everyone in the room understands what is meant by “affluence.”\n\nDoes it mean:\n\nhow much money someone currently has?\nIt is a measure of their potential spend?\nDoes it refer to their lifestyle and how much debt they may take on and can realistically pay?\n\n\n\nWhy do we want to do this?\n\nThe answer to why has design implications\nExamples\n\nIs it something we’ll use to set strategic goals?\nDo we want to use it to identify cross or upsell opportunities?\n\n\n\nAdditional Supplies:\n\nPoster or slide with these 2 questions\n\nProcess\n\nIntroduction\n\nBrief introduction of your team\nAddress goals of the workshop\n\nSplit into two or three groups\n\nIdeally between four to five people per group\nPut senior managers or executives in separate groups\n1 DS or analyst in each group\n\nHave groups answer the “What” question\n\nDuration: 15 min\n\nFeedback session with whole workshop\n\nDuration: 3 min\nGroup answers are presented and discussed\n\nHave groups answer the “Why” question\n\nDuration: 15 min\n\nFeedback session with whole workshop\n\nDuration: 3 min\nGroup answers are presented and discussed\n\n\nCompare and address gaps\n\nDuration: 4 min\nCompare all group answers against the current solution\n\ne.g. does the current metric represent these answers to “what” and “why”?\n\nIf there are gaps between the group answers and the current solution, try to figure out how best the fill those gaps.\n\n\nPost-Workshop Debrief\n\nShould occur the same day as the workshop\nDocument sticky notes and key ideas\n\nThe data scientists/analysts embedded in the groups should be able to expand on the ideas on the sticky notes\nIf the author of the idea was recorded, that should be included as well\n\nAs you’re starting to think of solutions to the pain points you discussed, reach out to authors/stakeholders to get their opinions on your thoughts and to understand where you might be able to get the data from.\n\n\nHave data team ideate on solutions to these painpoints, etc.",

More likely to get invested in its success. May require salesmanship to convince them that the knowledge of self has future benefits\nComing up with a concise question often involves drilling down into the mechanics of an organization.\n\nThis process can lead to discovering the importance of the research. Also, can lead to other research questions.\n\nIf stakeholder is ambiguous about what they want.

Related to qualitative factors and potential risks, we can conclude that if the project is back up by an influential group of leaders, then the positive aspects exceed the negative ones. On the balance, we would advise a GO decision for this project.”\n\n\n\nExecutive Presentation\n\nThe conclusion should be short, precise, and convincing format\nCrucial to persuade key stakeholders to invest in your project\nUse a good action title, writing down the most relevant requirements of your project, use a chart to visualize your results, and have some key takeaways on the bottom with a recommendation.\n\nProposal\n\nSections 1-3 should be put into a concise executive summary\nTell a story\n\nEvery item should be consistent with every other part\n\ne.g. a deliverable shouldn’t be mentioned if it’s not part of solving the issue in the problem statement\n\nShould flow from more abstract ideas to more and more detail\n\nFormat\n\nProblem Statement\n\nPaint a bleak picture and explain how the problem could’ve been overcome if your project were in production when the problem occurred\nList examples where risk and costs occurred, opportunities were missed, etc. and how your project would’ve prevented or taken advantage of these things if it had been in production\n\nskill upgrades or efficiency gains are NOT good answers\n\n\nVision\n\nTies your project to the companies long range strategy\n\nBenefits\n\ndetails  about the specific new capabilities provided or costs avoided\nneed to be quantifiable\n\nDeliverables\n\ndetails about other non-primary benefits\n\nSuccess Criteria\n\nCharacteristics\n\nspecific, measurable, bounded by a time period, realistic\n\n\nThe plan\n\noverview of the steps the project will take\n\nincludes deadlines, waterfall or agile approach, etc.\n\n\nCost/Budget\n\n\nTerms\n\nCost/Investment\n\nFixed\n\nPersonnel salaries\n\nIf you’re using outside data consultants, Glassdoor has average salaries, https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,13.htm\n\nexample: ~$100K each\n\n\nAdditional investments could be access to external data sources, research, and software licenses\n\nTableau can cost around $48K per year\n\nTraining for any additional or current personnel on tools or subject matter\n\nworkshops, online learning\ntax-reclamation example: ~$12K total\n\n\nVariable\n\nCloud storage\n\ntax-reclamation example: AWS (pay-as-you-go) $75K-$95K per year\n\n\n\nTax rate\n\ntax-reclamation example: 28%\n\nRevenue\n\nForecasts of revenue\n\nCorrection Factors\n\nExplains the difference between profit after tax and cashflow\ne.g. depreciation of investment, changing working capital, investment, change in financing or borrowing\n\ncost of sales = (revenue*some%) - 1\n\nrefers to what the seller has to pay in order to create the product and get it into the hands of a paying customer.\n\nMaybe this is a catch-all for anything else not covered in the Cost/Investment section\n\naka cost of revenue (sales/service) or cost of goods (manufacturing)\n30% used in example\nBegins after year 1\n\ndepreciation per year = (investment - salvage_value)/(num_years - 1)\n\nFor an datascience project, the salvage_value is 0 most of the time.\ndepreciation value is listed for each year after the first year of the project\ngets subtracted from revenue in calculation of profit_before_tax calculation\ngets added to profit_after_tax in cashflow equation\n\nChange in working capital = (expected_yearly_revenue/365) * customer_credit_period\n\ncustomer_credit_period (days): number of days that a customer is allowed to wait before paying an invoice. The concept is important because it indicates the amount of working capital that a business is willing to invest in its accounts receivable in order to generate sales.\n\n60 days used in example\n\nOnly a cost in the 1st yr and then it is recouped in the last year (somehow)\n\nsounds like this whole thing is just an accounting procedure\n\nDunno how this relates to a datascience project\n\n\n\nCost of Capital\n\nUsed to characterize risk here. Think 5-10% is used for back-of-the-envelope calculations.\n\nIn the tax-reclamation example, 8.3% was used\n\nAlso see\n\nAlgorithms, Product &gt;&gt; Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)\nMorgan Stanley’s Guide to Cost of Capital (Also in R &gt;&gt; Documents &gt;&gt; Business)\n\nThread about the guide\n\n\nCost of Capital is typically calculated as Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n\nSee Finance, Glossary &gt;&gt; Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n\nAs of January 2019, transportation in railroads has the highest cost of capital at 11.17%. The lowest cost of capital can be claimed by non-bank and insurance financial services companies at 2.79%.\nHigh CoCs - Biotech and pharmaceutical drug companies, steel manufacturers, Internet (software) companies, and integrated oil and gas companies. Those industries tend to require significant capital investment in research, development, equipment, and factories.\nLow CoCs - Money center banks, power companies, real estate investment trusts (REITs), retail grocery and food companies, and utilities (both general and water). Such companies may require less equipment or benefit from very steady cash flows.\n\nNet Present Value (NPV)\n\nUses cashflow (excludes year 1) and cost of capital as inputs\n\nExcel has some sort of NPV wizard that does the calculation (see tidyquant for npv function)\nExample in article provided link to his googlesheet so the formula is there or maybe googlesheets has a wizard too.\n\n\nInternal Rate of Return (IRR)\n\nIt’s the value that the cost of capital (aka discount rate) would have to be for NPV and cost to zero out each other.\nThe interest rate at which a company borrows against itself as a proxy for opportunity cost. Typically, large and/or public organizations have a budgetary IRR of 10% to 15% depending on the industry and financial situation.\nHigher is better\nOnly valid in very limited circumstances. MIRR is much better\n\nSee Finance, Glossary &gt;&gt; IRR, MIRR\n\n\nQualitative Factors\n\nOther things that have value but are difficult to quantify. Might change a quantitatively negative value project into a positive value project\n\nUses columns negative, positive, impact\n\nnegative and positive are indicators\nimpact has values low, medium, and high\n\n\nExamples\n\nProject has flexibility (+) (calculated using real options analysis(?))\nStrategic Fit (+) - supports strategy of the company (?)\n\nincreases trust with public\nmarketing boosted because they can use buzzwords like “AI” or “data-driven” in ads\n\nIncreases competency (+) - may help the company down the road\n\nmore agile, data-driven, familiarity with newer technologies\n\nred tape or bureaucracy or politics causing delays (-)\nImplementation (-)\n\ncan be a negative, if the leadership that’s needed is tied up with other projects\nChallenges",

    "text": "37.8 Choosing a Pipeline Framework\n - Kind of like working backwards in the data analysis workflow (design driven development) - Quantify the problems and develop KPIs that can inform the direction of the business - 10-15 organizational KPIs is common - Examples: Number of daily sales, the number of new customers, decreasing cost of operations/logistics - Build data pipelines around these critical KPIs - What data can we use that we already have access to? - What kind of internal data do we need to capture? - What kind of third party/external data could be useful? - What is the least amount of data available that can be used to approximate each KPI metric? - After the simplest version of the metric is built, you can brainstorm on how it can be improved. - Personalize a general metric to your specific business. - Split a general metric into smaller metrics can increase accuracy (e.g. product line, geography, etc.) - What kind of storage will we need? - Adding a pipeline for a new data source - Capture a sample of the data to examine its potential. (e.g. cookies on your website) - If metric measured from new data is potentially valuable, build a simple, less robust (without sacrificing too much data integrity) pipeline to your lake. - Meaning fewer built-in quality checks - Doing it this way does add technical debt - If metric feeds into a company-wide metric, then additional checks will need to be added - E.g. no duplicate datasets, data corruption, or data losses. - After 6 months or so, if metric remains useful, make pipeline more robust. - Adding third party data pipeline (e.g. Equifax) - E.g. demographic, income data - If a product has a certain demographics associated with it, this data can be used to weight customers relative to the demographic specifics of that product. - Get a sample first to determine if it’s worth it - 3rd party data is expensive to buy and usually a reoccurring cost. - Can be time-consuming and resource intensive to add the pipeline - Get transparency on how the data was collected and validity checks used - Periodically reevaluate whether the metrics fundamentally still make sense from a business perspective and how they can be improved. - Expand pipelines to capture additional data in order to continue to refine metrics - Drop and add metrics as business and trends change. - Redefine metrics as needed -",

    "text": "PCA\n\nDescription\n\nCreates a subset of variables that maximises the covariance with the initial variable set, in order to store as much information as possible in a lower dimension.\nCompute an orthogonal basis of the space created by the original set of variables. The vectors creating this basis are the eigenvectors of the variance-covariance matrix. Reducing the dimension is then easily done by selecting the eigenvectors that are most representative of the initial data: those that contain most of the covariance. The amount of covariance stored by the vectors is quantified by the eigenvalues: the larger the eigenvalue, the more interesting its associated vectors.\nProjects variables orthogonally which removes correlation between predictor variables. The projection is in the direction of maximum variation such that the variation is distributed unequally among the transformed vectors. This allows the user to reduce the feature space while still being able to capture most of variance in the data.\nThe principal components are equal to linear combinations of the correlated variables and these components are orthogonal to each other.\nWhy? When multiple variables are highly correlated to each other it causes the math used calculate regression models to break down. High dimension datasets also require large amount computational resources. Too many columns compared to the number of rows.\n\n\n\nMisc\n\nAs a multicollinearity detector?\n\n“use principal component analysis, and examine the screeplot, or proportion of variation explained by a subset of principal components. If all (or almost all) of the variation is explained with a small subset of all the variables, it means you have a multicollinearity problem. You will need to drop some variables or do some other dimension reduction to fix it before choosing your final model.”\nI mean what if you have 20 variables and 3 are collinear, would this be detectable with PCA? I don’t think so. Seem more likely that it would take a large portion of your variables being collinear for it to be detectable in this fashion.\n\n\n\n\nPreprocessing\n\nNotes from thread\nCenter variables\n\ncenter = T is default in prcomp( )\nIf variables are NOT on similar scales, then the data need to be scaled, also.\n\nProbably safer to always scale.\n\n\nSqrt any count variables\nLog any variable with a heavy tail\nIf you have too many features, use a sparse matrix to speed the process.\n\n\n\nDiagnostics\n\nTest for localization (repo with R code/docs)\n\nBad: if you make a histogram of a component (or loading) vector and it has really big outliers (aka localization)\n\nMeans this vector is mostly noise\n\nSolution: Regularized spectral clustering (links to resources)\nD_r = Diagonal(1/ sqrt(rs + mean(rs))\nD_c = Diagonal(1/ sqrt(cs + mean(cs))\n# Do SVD on\nD_r %*% A %*% D_c\n\nA is your matrix\nrs is a vector containing the row sums of the matrix\ncs is a vector containing the column sums of the matrix\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps\n\nCenter data in design matrix, A (n x p)\n\nIf data are centered and scaled then the computation in step 2 will result in the correlation matrix instead of the covariance matrix.\n\nCompute \\(n \\times n\\) Covariance Matrix,\n\\[\nC_x = \\frac{1}{n-1}AA^T\n\\]\n\nAlso seen \\(A^T A\\) but I don’t think it matters. The upper triangle and the lower triangle of this product are just reverse covariances of each other and thus equal and I suspect the order just switches flips the triangles. The eigenvectors/eigenvalues get reordered later on anyways.\nThe diagonal of this matrix is the variable variances.\n\nCalculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues: \\(C_x V = D_\\lambda V\\) shows the covariance matrix as a transformation matrix. \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix (\\(p\\times p\\)) with eigenvalues along the diagonal. \\(V\\) is a matrix (\\(p \\times p\\)) of eigenvectors\n\\[\nD_\\lambda = VC_x V^{-1}\n\\]\nOrder eigenvalues from largest to smallest\nOrder the eigenvectors according to the order of their corresponding eigenvalues\nEquation for the ith value of the PC1 vector: \\(\\text{PC1}_i = V_{(,1)} \\cdot A_{(i,)}\\)\n\n\\(\\text{PC2}\\) is similar except \\(V_{(,2)}\\) is used\nWhere all the variables in \\(A\\) have been standardized and \\(V\\) contains the loadings (see below)\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\\(AA^T\\) is positive definite\n\nWhich means it’s symmetric\nWhich means it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors\nWhich means the eigenvectors have covariances = 0\nWhich means the eigenvectors aren’t correlated.\n\nThe eigenvalues are eigenvector’s standard deviations which determines how much variance is explained by that PC.\nThe variance of a variable is the dot-product of itself and it’s transpose, \\(x_i \\cdot x^t_i\\)\nThe covariance between two variables, \\(x_i \\cdot x^t_j\\)\nIn step 3 equation, eigenvalues give the magnitude (length of vector) and eigenvectors the direction after being transformed by the covariance matrix.\nElements in a PC vector are called scores and elements in the V eigenvector are called loadings.\n\nThe loadings are the coefficients in the linear combination of variables that equals the PC vector\nLoadings range from -1 to 1\nVariables with high loadings (usually defined as .4 in absolute value or higher because this suggests at least 16% of the measured variable variance overlaps with the variance of the component) are most representative of the component\nThe sign of a loading (+ or -) indicates whether a variable and a principal component are positively or negatively correlated.\n\nScaling your design matrix variables just means your using a correlation matrix instead of a covariance matrix.\nPCA is sensitive to outliers. Variance explained will be inflated in the direction of the outlier\n\nGuessing this means components strongly influenced by variables with outlier values will have their variance-explained value inflated\n\nRow order of data matters as to which interpretation (latent) of component is valid from Principle Components and Penguins\n\nUsed data from palmerpenguins to create a “penguin size” variable from performing PCA on the data.\nIn one row order, high values of pc1 were associated with high body mass, but after scrambling the rows, high values of pc1 were associated with low body mass.\nHave to be careful when adding new data to the PCA-created feature. It might arbitrarily change the sign of the component and change the meaning of the feature.\n\nPCA doesn’t take the response variable into account (unsupervised). Therefore, the directions (eigenvectors) obtained may be well-suited for the predictor variables, but not necessarily optimal for predicting the response. It does often produce pretty good results though.\n\nAn alternative would be Partial Least Squares (PLS) which does take the response into account (supervised).\n\nIn practice, PLS reduces bias while potentially increasing the variance so the benefit vs PCA regression is usually a wash.\nCapable of handling multivariate regression\nPopular in chemometrics for analyzing spectra.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlots\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from: https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/modeling-statistics/multivariate/how-to/principal-components/interpret-the-results/all-statistics-and-graphs/\n(See bkmk) use broom::augment to add original data to pca output. Coloring the points by categorical variables can help with interpreting the components\nAlso see pkgs in notebook for visualization options\n\nScore\n\n\nClusters\n\nIf data follow a multivariate normal distribution then scores should be randomly distributed around zero\nIf there are clusters, then there may be multiple distributions present\n\nExtreme points (e.g. point in bottom right) might be outliers and it might be worthwhile to investigate them further\n\nLoadings\n\n\nNeed to imagine an axis at (0,0). Don’t know why they don’t plot them with those axes.\nFinding the largest variable influences on a PC can used to interpret it’s meaning (think latent variable)\nArrows\n\nA (near) horizontal arrow (along the x-axis) describes that the feature contributes strongly toward PC1.\nA (near) vertical arrow (along the y-axis) describes that a feature contributes strongly towards PC2.\n\nValues\n\nLoadings range from -1 to 1\nThe termination coordinate of the line gives the loading values for that variable for both PCs\nLoadings (absolute magnitude) close to 0 indicate that the variable has little influence on that PC\nLarger the absolute value of the loading the greater the influence on that PC\nNegative values have negative influence on the latent variable that the PC represents (vice versa for positive values)\n\nAngle\n\nacute angles represent a positive correlation between those variables\nobtuse angles represent a negative correlation between those variables\n90 degree angles represent independence between those variables\n\nExample\n\nAge, Residence, and Employ have large influences on PC1 (interpretation: financial stability)\nCredit cards, Debt, and Education have large influences on PC2 (interpretation: credit history)\nSays, “As the number credit cards increases, credit history (PC2 interpretation) becomes more negative.”\n\n\nBi-Plot\n\n\nCombination plot of the score and loading plot\nCan augment pca output (see top of section) with original data and color the scores by different categorical variables\n\nIf a categorical variable level is clustered around Education, you could say as Education rises, the more likely that that person is &lt;categorical level&gt;.\nIn turn, that categorical level would be either positively or negatively (depending on the loading sign) associated with that PC.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nExample: Bluejays\n\nLoadings\n\n\nPC2 represents the difference between bill size and skull size\n\nLoadings together with components plot\n\n\nMale birds larger than female birds\n\nIf you look at the loadings plot, negative pc1 corresponds to larger size and the components plot shows males with negative PC1 values\n\nBoth sexes have large and short bills relative to their overall size\n\nMales and females both show values above and below 0 in PC2\nLarger bills but smaller bodies (+PC2) and larger bodies but smaller bills (-PC2)\n\n\nVariance Explained\n\n\nOverall bird size explains &gt; 50% of the variation in measurements\n\n\n\nExample: How much variation in a principal component can be explained by a categorical variable\n# Penguins dataset\n# pca_values is a prcomp() object\npca_points &lt;- \n  # first convert the pca results to a tibble\n  as_tibble(pca_values$x) %&gt;% \n  # now we'll add the penguins data\n  bind_cols(penguins)\n## # A tibble: 6 x 12\n##    PC1    PC2    PC3    PC4 species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm\n##  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 -1.85 -0.0320  0.235  0.528 Adelie  Torge…          39.1          18.7\n## 2 -1.31  0.443  0.0274  0.401 Adelie  Torge…          39.5          17.4\n## 3 -1.37  0.161  -0.189  -0.528 Adelie  Torge…          40.3          18 \n## 4 -1.88  0.0123  0.628  -0.472 Adelie  Torge…          36.7          19.3\n## 5 -1.92 -0.816  0.700  -0.196 Adelie  Torge…          39.3          20.6\n## 6 -1.77  0.366  -0.0284  0.505 Adelie  Torge…          38.9          17.8\n## # … with 4 more variables: flipper_length_mm &lt;int&gt;, body_mass_g &lt;int&gt;,\n## #  sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;\n\npc1_mod &lt;- \n  lm(PC1 ~ species, pca_points)\nsummary(pc1_mod)\n## Call:\n## lm(formula = PC1 ~ species, data = pca_points)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##    Min      1Q  Median      3Q    Max \n## -1.3011 -0.4011 -0.1096  0.4624  1.7714 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##                  Estimate Std.

Supposedly outliers affect the covariance matrix which affects the PCA, which affects the scores, which affects theMahalanobis distance (MD). So the MD might be biased and not be accurate in determining outliers\n\nRobust forms of PCA (see section below) would be recommended if you suspect outliers in your data.\n\nDisplays the Mahalanobis distance (MD) for each observation and a reference line to identify outliers. The Mahalanobis distance is the distance between each data point and the centroid of multivariate space (the overall mean).\n\nOutliers determined by whether the Mahalanobis Distance is greater than the square root of the Chi-Square statistic where m is the number of variables and α = 0.05\n\nNo outliers in the chart above as all MDs lower than the threshold at 4.4\n\n\nLeverage Points and Orthogonal Outliers\n\nNotes from https://towardsdatascience.com/multivariate-outlier-detection-in-high-dimensional-spectral-data-45878fd0ccb8\nTypes\n\nLeverage Points\n\ncharacterized by a high score distance\ngood leverage points also have short orthogonal distance and bad leverage points have long orthogonal distances\ngood leverage points have a positive effect\n\nOrthogonal Outliers\n\ncharacterized by a high orthogonal distance\n\n\nType determined by (see article for the math)\n\nScore DIstance (SD) - the distance an observation is from center of K-dimensional PCA subspace\nOrthogonal Distance (OD) - the deviation — i.e. lack of fit — of an observation from the k-dimensional PCA subspace\nOutliers are determined by Chi-Square test very similar to the Mahalanobis Distance method (see above).\n\n\n\nIn the example shown, the red dots are data known to be measurement errors. Most of the red dots are captured in the orthogonal and bad sections but quite a few normal observation (blue) points too. So this method needs to be used as a guide and followed up upon when it flags points.\n\n\n\nHotelling’s T2 and SPE/DmodX (Complementary Tests)\n\n{{pca}}\nHotelling’s T2 works by computing the chi-square tests across the top n_components for which the p-values are returned that describe the likeliness of an outlier. This allows for ranking the outliers from strongest to weak.\nSPE/DmodX (distance to model) based on the mean and covariance of the first 2 PCs\n\n\n\n\nExtensions\n\nRobust PCA\n\nData with outliers and high dimensional data (p &gt;&gt; n) are not suitable for regular PCA where p is the number of variables.\nLow Dim methods (only valid when n &gt; 2p) that find robust (against outliers) estimates of the covariance matrix\n\nS-estimator, MM-estimator, (Fast)MCD-estimator, re-weighted MCD- (RMCD) estimator\n\nHigh Dim Methods\n\nRobust PCA by projection-pursuit (PP-PCA)\n\nfinds directions for eigenvectors that maximize a “projection index” instead of directions that maximize variance\n\nMAD or Qn-estimator is used a projection index\n\n\nSpherical PCA (SPCA)\n\nhandles outliers by projecting points onto a sphere instead of a line or plane\n\nalso uses MAD or Qn-estimator\n\n\nRobust PCA (ROBPCA)\n\ncombines projection index approach with low dim robust covariance estimation methods somehow\n\nRobust Sparse PCA (ROSPCA)\n\nsame but uses sparse pca\napplicable to both symmetrically distributed data and skewed data\n\n\n\nKernel PCA\n\nPackages: {kernlab}\nNonlinear data (notebook)\nPCA in a hypothetical (kernel trick), higher dimensional space\nWith more dimensions, data points become more separable.\nResults depend on type of kernel\n\nGaussian Kernel\n\nTuning parameter: sigma\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidymodels\n\nRecipe step\n# if only using dummy vars, no sure if normalization is necessary\n# step_normalize(&lt;pca variables&gt;)\nstep_pca(starts_with(\"tf_\"), num_comp = tune())\n# don't forget to include num_comp in your tuning grid\nTaking a tidymodel’s recipe object and performing PCA\ntf_mat &lt;- recipe_obj %&gt;%\n    # normalizing tokenized indicators (?)\n    # since these are all dummy vars, not sure if a normalization step is necessary)\n    step_normalize(starts_with(\"tf_\")) %&gt;%\n    prep() %&gt;%\n    bake() %&gt;%\n    # only want to pca text features\n    select(starts_with(\"tf_\") %&gt;%\n    as.matrix()\n\ns &lt;- svd(tf_mat)\n# scree plot\ntidy(s, matrix = \"d\") %&gt;%\n    filter(PC &lt;= 50) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = PC, y = percent)) +\n    geom_point()\n\nmatrix (tidy arg):\n\n“u”, “samples”, “scores”, or “x”: Returns info about the map from the original space to the pc space\n“v”, “rotation”, “loadings”, or “variables”: Returns information about the map from the pc space to the original space\n“d”, “eigenvalues”, or “pcs”: Returns information about the eigenvalues\n\n\nExample\nlibrary(tidymodels) \nlibrary(workflowsets) \nlibrary(tidyposterior) \ndata(meats, package= \"modeldata\") \n# Keep only the water outcome \nmeats &lt;- select(meats, -fat, -protein) \nset.seed(1) \nmeat_split &lt;- initial_split(meats) \nmeat_train &lt;- training(meat_split) \nmeat_test &lt;- testing(meat_split) \nset.seed(2) \nmeat_folds &lt;- vfold_cv(meat_train, repeats = 3)\nbase_recipe &lt;- \n  recipe(water ~ ., data = meat_train) %&gt;% \n  step_zv(all_predictors()) %&gt;% \n  step_YeoJohnson(all_predictors()) %&gt;% \n  step_normalize(all_predictors()) \npca_recipe &lt;- \n  base_recipe %&gt;% \n  step_pca(all_predictors(), num_comp = tune()) \npca_kernel_recipe &lt;- \n  base_recipe %&gt;% \n  step_kpca_rbf(all_predictors(), num_comp = tune(), sigma = tune())",

As the number of variables (&gt;40 variables) involved in the analysis grows, results from PCA and EFA become more and more similar.\nSimilarly calculated method to PCA, but FA is an analysis on a reduced correlation matrix, for which the ones in the diagonal have been replaced by squared multiple correlations (SMC)\n\nA SMC is the estimate of the variance that the underlying factor(s) explains in a given variable (aka communality).\n\nThe variability in measured variables in PCA causes the variance in the principal component.

Can give much better results than RAG when querying an LLM about documents.\n\nRetrieving the context that is the most relevant for the query with a simple semantic similarity search is not always effective. Especially, when the query does not provide enough context about its true intent, or when the context is fragments across a large corpus of text.\n\nRetail: Knowledge graphs have been for up-sell and cross-sell strategies, recommending products based on individual purchase behavior and popular purchase trends across demographic groups.\nEntertainment: Knowledge graphs are also leveraged for artificial intelligence (AI) based recommendation engines for content platforms, like Netflix, SEO, or social media. Based on click and other online engagement behaviors, these providers recommend new content for users to read or watch.\nFinance: This technology has also been used for know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering initiatives within the finance industry. They assist in financial crime prevention and investigation, allowing banking institutions to understand the flow of money across their clientele and identify noncompliant customers.\nHealthcare: Knowledge graphs are also benefiting the healthcare industry by organizing and categorizing relationships within medical research. This information assists providers by validating diagnoses and identifying treatment plans based on individual needs.",

    "text": "Terms\nKnowledge Graph - Also known as a semantic network, represents a network of real-world entities — i.e. objects, events, situations, or concepts — and illustrates the relationship between them. Each node represents a concept and each edge is a relationship between a pair of such concepts. This information is usually stored in a graph database and visualized as a graph structure, prompting the term knowledge “graph.”",

Assign a chunk_id to each of these chunks.\nFor every text chunk, extract concepts and their semantic relationships using a LLM. This relation is assigned a weight of W1. There can be multiple relationships between the same pair of concepts. Every such relation is an edge between a pair of concepts.\nConsider that the concepts that occur in the same text chunk are also related by their contextual proximity. This relation is assigned a weight of W2. Note that the same pair of concepts may occur in multiple chunks.\nGroup similar pairs, sum their weights, and concatenate their relationships. So now we have only one edge between any distinct pair of concepts. The edge has a certain weight and a list of relations as its name.\nPopulate nodes (concepts) and edges (relations) in a graph data structure or a graph database.\nVisualize",
