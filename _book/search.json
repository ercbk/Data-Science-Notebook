This corresponds to pairwise learning to rank. The implementation has some issues with average AUC around groups and distributed workers not being well-defined.\naucpr: Area under the PR curve. Available for classification and learning-to-rank tasks.\n\nFor ranking task, only binary relevance label is supported. Different from map (mean average precision), aucpr calculates the interpolated area under precision recall curve using continuous interpolation.\n\n\ngroup input format (docs)\n\nFor a ranking task, XGBoost requires an file that indicates the group information.\n\nquery id columns (docs)\n\nFor a ranking task, you may embed query group ID for each instance in the LIBSVM file by adding a token of form qid:xx in each row\n\n\n\nLightGBM:\n\nlambdarank objective: LGBMRanker(objective=\"lambdarank\")\nExpects the target (relevance score) to be an integer\n\nIf your score is a decimal, then you can apply a transformation to get an integer\n\nmultiply by 10, 100, etc. to get an integer (e.g. 0.10 -&gt; 0.14 * 100 = 14) (See Example: anime recommendation)\nBin by quantile, then apply a ranking function (See Example: stock portfolio)\n\nUseful if the variable has negative values\n\n\n\nDatasets should be sorted by user id or query id (might be required for group parameter, see below)\n\nDidn’t see this in every example, so I don’t know if it’s required or not. None of the authors gave me complete confidence that they knew what they were doing.\n\n\nExample: py, LightGBM, anime recommendation (article)\n\ntest_size = int(1e5)\nX,y = train_processed[features],train_processed[target].apply(lambda x:int(x * 10))\ntest_idx_start = len(X)-test_size\nxtrain,xtest,ytrain,ytest = X.iloc[0:test_idx_start],X.iloc[test_idx_start:],y.iloc[0:test_idx_start],y.iloc[test_idx_start:]\n\nget_group_size = lambda df: df.reset_index().groupby(\"user_id\")['user_id'].count()\ntrain_groups = get_group_size(xtrain)\ntest_groups = get_group_size(xtest)\nprint(sum(train_groups) , sum(test_groups))\n#(4764372, 100000)\n\nmodel = LGBMRanker(objective=\"lambdarank\")\nmodel.fit(xtrain,ytrain,group=train_groups,eval_set=[(xtest,ytest)],eval_group=[test_groups],eval_metric=['ndcg'])\n\nIn this example, “relevance_score” is the relevance score (i.e. target), users (“user_id”) are the queries and the anime (“anime_id”) they are interested in are the documents.\n\nOther predictors included\n\nThe “group” parameter enables the model to learn the relative importance of different features within each group, which can improve the model’s overall performance\n\nA query (e.g. user) can have many documents (e.g. products) associated with it. So in this example, a user and the products associate with him is a “group”.\nThe total groups should be the number of samples (i.e. total number of users or queries)\ne.g. group = [3, 2, 1] says the first user has 3 products associated with her, the seconder user has 2 products, and the third user has 1 product.\n“So it’s vital to sort the dataset by user_id(query_id) before creating the group parameter.”\n\nPredicting relevance scores in production for the same users in the training set\n\nYou need to have a selection of products that the user hasn’t used before.\n\ne.g. movies: if you’re recommending movies to a user, you shouldn’t recommend ones they’ve already seen. (i.e. movies mapped to their user id in the training data)\n\nIn this example\n\nSelect the user’s favorite N number of genres.\nFor each genre in the above-selected genres, pick the highest-rated m animes. Now you have M* N animes to rank for that user.\nJust create the user base and anime-based features. And finally, call the .predict() method with the created feature vector.\n\n\nExample: py, LightGBM, score interpretation (article)\n\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=1)\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=1)\n\nquery_train = [X_train.shape[0]]\nquery_val = [X_val.shape[0]]\nquery_test = [X_test.shape[0]]\n\ngbm = lgb.LGBMRanker()\ngbm.fit(X_train, y_train, group=query_train,\n        eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)], eval_group=[query_val],\n        eval_at=[5, 10, 20], early_stopping_rounds=50)\n\nNo clue what the data is… could be movies for a recommendation\n“early_stopping_rounds=50” says training continues until there’s no improvement for 50 rds.\n“eval_at”  are the k values used to evaluate nDCG@k over the validation set\nPredictions\n\n\ntest_pred = gbm.predict(X_test)\nX_test[\"predicted_ranking\"] = test_pred\nX_test.sort_values(\"predicted_ranking\", ascending=False)\n\n“This numbers can be interpreted as probabilities of a item being relevant (or being at the top).”\n\nMost are negative, though!

Here the treatment is the custormer receiving a discount offer or a buy-one-get-one free offer.\nCalculate the three uplift metrics for each offer type.\nFit a binary class model that provides conversion probabilities for each customer.\n\nAlso see Propensity Model\n\nFit a multiclass model whose probabilities will be used to calculate an uplift score for each customer.\n\nThe conversion probabilities will be used to investigate which features are driving the conversion uplift.\nThe upper quantile uplift scores can be used to target customers that are more likely to respond to a particular offer.\n\n\nMetric Calculations\n\nUplift\n\nConversion Uplift (%) = Conversion rate of treatment group - conversion rate of control group.\n\n“conversion” means a purchase was made.\n\nLarger is better.\n\nPurchase rate increase/decrease resulting from the offer campaign\n\nOrder Uplift = Conversion uplift * # converted customers in treatment group.\n\nThe number of purchases as a result of the offer campaign\n\nRevenue Uplift ($) = Order Uplift * Average order $ value.\n\nExpected revenue as a result of the offer campaign\n\n\nbase conversion rate:\n\n\n        df %&gt;%\n            filter(offer = \"no offer\") %&gt;%\n            summarize(base_conv = mean(conversion))\n\noffer has 3 categories: no offer, discount, buy_one_get_one (bogo)\n\ndiscount and bogo conversion rates similar.

This variable was k-means clustered into 5 clusters, and the clusters were used as a variable. e.g. customer id# 12 belongs to cluster 4. I don’t know if this is a better way of binning a continuous variable or what. Need to research if maybe it’s some sort of Kaggle thing or something shown to work well with xgboost. 5 clusters were used with no explanation of how that number was reached.\nPredictor variables used:\n\nrecency: months since last purchase\nclustered_history: clustered history variable which was the $value of the historical purchases\nused_discount: indicator on whether the customer had used a “discount” offer before this experiment\nused_bogo: indicator on whether a customer had used a “buy one get one” offer before this experiment\nzip_code: class of the zip code as Suburban/Urban/Rural\nis_new: indicates if the customer is new\nchannel: methods of contact that the customer is using, Phone/Web/Multichannel\n\nXGBoost model trained. Predict( ) using training data to get class probabilities.\nTake target var predicted probabilities and calculate the uplift score for each customer using the above formula.\nModel results analysis: compare uplift metrics of customers with an upper quantile (&gt; 0.75) uplift score to those with a lower quantile (&lt; 0.25). Use test set.\n\nTake the Revenue Uplift from the first section and calc the revenue uplift per targeted customer. This will be used as a baseline to compare the two quantiles against.\n\n base_Discount Revenue Uplift per targeted = Discount Revenue Uplift / # of customers with offer == discount\n\nfilter test data where uplift_score &gt; quantile(uplift_score, 0.75) –&gt; calc the Discount Uplift metrics –&gt; calc the test_Discount Revenue Uplift per targeted customer.\nEstimated percentage change in the Discount Revenue Uplift per targeted customer = (test_DRU_per_cust - base_DRU_per_cust) / base_DRU_per_cust\nSays that the model estimates that targeting the upper quantile uplift scores with a discount offer will lead to a  increase in revenue uplift per customer."

Unless this is a different calculation from a standard Beta distribution, the parameters can be calculated using the sample mean and sample standard deviation. Compare “DERL PAPER” bkmk’d in the CLV folder with calculation from bkmk in Beta regression folder.\nCurves and interpretations wrt to various Beta Regression parameter values, α and β\n\n\n\n\nA survival rate can be calculated using the retention rates from formula using the model estimates for α and β.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute Discounted Expected Residual Lifetime (DERL)\n\nA CLV measure for contractual businesses\n\n\nFormula assumes a constant net cashflow per period (e.g. contract = $1000 per customer per year)\n“active in n” refers to number of years as an active customer\n\nsee first sentence of the “contractual and discrete” section above for an active customer definition\nsee 3rd bullet below for an example\n\nd: discount rate (aka hurdle rate)\n\nMinimum expected return on investment. 10% is common and 5% is usually the minimum, i.e. a replacement-level ROI. If the discount rate is 10% percent, then that says that the current investment strategies are yielding at least 10%, so this one should be at least that good. The thinking is, “why spend money on this investment if it has a lower discount rate instead of putting it to work in one of the other strategies that’s yielding at least 10%?”\n\nThe summation goes from n to infinity but in practice, is stopped when term values approach zero.\n\nExample goes out to t = 200 and the last term is equal to 5 x 10^-12. which seems like extreme overkill to me.\n\nExample for cohort 2: 3 active years with 2 renewals\n\nCalculate the Survival Rates out to the specified number of terms\n\nS(0) = 1, S(1) = [(beta + (t=1) -1) / (alpha + beta + (t=1) - 1)] * S(0), S(2) = same equation with t=2 * S(1) … compute until S(200)\n\nConceptually, S(0) makes sense because t = 0 is the initial contract, so everyone “survived.” Therefore the survival rate = 1. But it doesn’t really follow if you set t = 0 in the retention rate equation\n\n\nCalculate the Survival Rate Ratios,  , first half of the DERL equation\n\nWe calculating for cohort 2, where custormers have n = 3 active years, so the denominator with always be n-1 =2. The number just follows the index, t, in the summation.\nS(3)/S(2), S(4)/s(2), …, S(200)/S(2)\n\nCalculate the Discount Rate half of the equation using a 10% discount rate,  :\n\n(1/(1+0.10))^(3-3), same^(4-3), …, same^(200-3).\nSo this ratio acts a scaling factor than makes the terms smaller and smaller.\n\nderl_2 = sum(element-wise product of last two steps) \n\nIn R, this would some kind of recursive loop? Maybe a map2 function with a vector with t-values and a constant n vector (so as not to hard-code) as arguments. Or a pmap and include a constant, d vector\nfor a customer who has made two contract renewals (evaluated just before the point in time at which the third contract renewal decision is to be made)\n\n\n\n\nValue of Consumer Base\n\n\nValue = [(# number of consumers in cohort 0) * contract_value * derl_0] + [(number of consumers in cohort 1) * contract_value * derl_1] + …"

    "text": "1.1 Trees\n\nAlgorithmic models that recursively split the data into smaller and more homogeneous subgroups. Predictions are the same for every member of the subgroup (aka piece-wise constant). Forests smooth out the piecewise predictions by averaging over groups of trees.\nHow Tree models get probabilities\n\nMethod 1: Each tree predicts the class of x according to the leaf node x falls within. The leaf node output is the majority class of the training points it contains. The predictions of all trees are considered as votes, and the class with the most votes is taken as the output of the forest. This is the original formulation of random forests proposed by Breiman (2001).\nMethod 2: Each tree outputs a vector [p1,…,pk], where k is the number of classes, representing the predicted probability of each class given x. This may be estimated as the relative class frequencies of training points in the leaf node x falls within. The forest output is the average of these vectors across trees, representing a conditional distribution over classes given x.\nExample: Data point falls into a tree’s leaf where yellow is the predicted class (2nd child split) \n\nFor this tree in the ensemble, there are 3 yellow and 1 green in the terminal leaf (2nd child split). Therefore the probability of Yellow is 75%.\nFor each class, the trees that predict that class have their probabilites averaged to produced the predicted probability for that class.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Decision Trees\n\nClassification\n\nShowing entropy but misclassification error or the gini index can be used.\nCalculate Shannon Entropy of dependent variable (Y):\n where P(Y) is the marginal probability\n\nFor a binary variable, this would be\n\nIn general the Shannon Entropy equation is\n where p is a probability and c is the number of classes for the variable and S = subset of data or the node.\nProbabilities are between (0,1) and taking a log of numbers in this interval produces a negative value. Hence, the negative at the beginning of the expression.\nIf the natural log, ln, is used then it’s called deviance\n\nCalculate the entropy of the target, Y, with respect to each independent variable, x. For variable,\n\n\n, with number of classes, c :\n\nI do NOT like the way the equation is written above. In videos, this type of entropy isn’t given a name, but I think it matches conditional entropy in its description and calculation.\n\nConditional Entropy (for a particular x),\n\n\nThis definition uses\n\n\nWhere H is used to as the symbol for entropy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marginal probability for that class of that variable, i.e. ratio of instances of that class in the entire dataset.\n\nExample: \n\nNot explicitly shown above, but for the entropy calculations, it uses the sum of the rows as the denominator in probability calculations. This fits with a “conditional” type of entropy.\n\n\nCalculate information gain for variable  \n\nRepeat for all independent variables\n\nSelect the independent variable with the largest gain for first split (\n\nFirst split, i.e. root node, is the most influential variable\n\nIf categorical variable chosen, leaves are all levels of that variable\n\nSubset dataset by var == level (for each branch\nRepeat entropy and information gain calculations on the subsetted data set\n\nBranches with entropy &gt; 1 are split unless some other stopping criteria is reached\n\nChoose variable with largest information gain and split by that variable\nKeeping repeating until maxdepth reached or minimum node size (number of rows in subset) reached\n\nNumerical vars are binned and treated like categorical vars\nPredicted class is the mode of the classes in the appropriate terminal node\n\nRegression\n\nFor each predictor var, choose a separator value, s\n\ne.g var1 &gt; 5 and var1 &lt;= 5 where s = 5\n\nCalculate the mean y value for both regions then calculate the MSE ((obs - mean)^2) of both regions. Sum of both MSEs. The optimal separator produces the lowest sum MSE.\nWhichever predictor has lowest sum MSE is chosen as the split variable.\nRecursively repeat. For example, repeat on region where var1 &gt;5 and repeat on region where var1 &lt;= 5.\nContinue until max.depth, max splits reached or data points in created region is less than a minimum or MSEs being calculated are all greater than a chosen amount, or… etc. (Hyperparameters)\nPrediction is the mean in the appropriate terminal node\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Random Forest\n\n\nSeveral independent decision trees are fitted. Each tree just gets a part of the variable and then splits the outcome space according to the features in X\nWhen we ‘’drop down’’ a new point x, it will end up in a leaf for each tree. A leaf is a set with observations i and taking the average over all yi in that leaf gives the prediction for one tree. These predictions are then averaged to give the final result. Thus, for a given x if you want to predict the conditional mean of Y given that x, you:\n\n“Drop down” the x each tree (this is indicated in red in the above figure). Since the splitting rules were made on X, your new point x will safely land somewhere in a leaf node.\nFor each tree you average the responses yi in that leaf to get an estimate of the conditional mean of each tree.\nYou average each conditional mean over the trees to get the final prediction.\n\nAveraging the prediction of all trees leads to a marked reduction in variance.\nMissing Predictor Data\n\nSee StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering video for more details\nProcess: Classification model\n\nMissingness is in the training data\n\nChoose intial values for the missing data\n\nLooks at that predictor’s values that have the same outcome value as the observation with the missing data\n\nCategorical: For example, if the row has an observed outcome of 1 (i.e. event), then it will look at that predictor’s values with outcome = 1 and choose the most popular category for the missing value\nNumeric: same as categorical, except the median value of predictor is chosen for the missing value\n\n\nCreate a “Proximity Matrix” to determine which observation is most similar to observation with the missing data\n\nThe matrix values are counts of how many times each row ends up in the node as the missing data row across all the trees in the forest\nThe counts are then divided by the number of trees in the forest\n\nCategorical: Weights for each category are calculated (see video). These weights are multiplied times the observed frequency of the category in the training data. The category with the highest weighted frequency becomes the new value for the missing data.\nNumerical: The weights are used to calculate a weighted average. So, weight * median is the new value for the missing data\nProcess is repeated until the values don’t change within a tolerance\n\nMissingness in the out-of-sample data\n\nA copy of the observation with the missingness is made for each outcome category.\nThe proximity matrix procedure is done for each copy\nThen a prediction for each copy with it’s new value is made in each tree of the forest. (of course the label for each copy has now been stripped)\nWhichever copy had it’s (stripped) outcome label predicted correctly by the most trees wins and that label is prediction for that observation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Isolation Forests\n\nUsed for anomaly detection. Algorithm related to binary search.\nNotes from paper: https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf\nAlso see Anomaly Detection &gt;&gt; Isolation Forests\nThe tree algorithm chooses a predictor at random for the root node. Then randomly chooses either the minimum or the maximum of that variable as the splitting value. The algorithm recursively subsamples like normal trees (choosing variables and split points in the same manner) until each terminal node has one data point or replicates of the same data point or preset maximum tree height is reached. Across the trees of a forest, anomalies with have a shorter average path length from root to terminal node.\n\nThe algorithm is basically looking for observations with combinations of variables that have extreme values. The process of continually splitting subsamples of data will run out data points and be reduced to a single observation more quickly for an anomalous observation than a common observation.\nMakes sense. Picturing a tree structure, there shouldn’t be too many observations with more that a few minimums/maximums of variable values. The algorithm weeds out these observations as it moves down the tree structure.\n\nAny or all of these wouldn’t necessarily be global minimum/maximums since we’re dealing with subsamples of variable values as we move down the tree.\n\nPaper has some nice text boxes with pseudocode that goes through the steps of the algorithm.\n\nAnomaly scores range from 0 to 1. Observations with a shorter average path length will have a larger score.\n\nAnomaly score,\n\n\nWhere E(h(xi)) is the average path length across the isolation forest for that observation\n\n\n\nWhere H(i) is the Harmonic number,\n\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe closer an observation’s score is to 1 the more likely that it is an anomaly\nThe closer to zero, the more likely the observation isn’t an anomaly.\nObservations with scores around 0.5 means that the algorithm can’t find a distinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Distributional Trees/Forests\n\n\nBlends the distributional modeling of gamlss (additive, nonlinear,  location, scale, shape) and the abrupt-change detection, additive + multiplicative effects capability, inclusion of interaction effects of decision trees / random forests. For regression trees, estimating all the distributional parameters instead of just the mean makes calculating the uncertainty easier.\n\nCART trees don’t have a concept of statistical signiﬁcance, and so cannot distinguish between a signiﬁcant and an insigniﬁcant improvement in the information measure.\nCART tree predictions are piecewise-constant (every observation in the node has the same prediction), it will not be accurate unless the tree is large. But a large tree is harder to interpret than a small one.\nLinear trends are difficult for trees with piecewise-constant predictions\n\nAlgorithm splits based on changes in the mean and higher moments. So able to capture things like changes in variance.\nConditional distributions allow for the computation of prediction intervals.\nThis framework embeds recursive partitioning into statistical model estimation and variable selection\nThe statistical formulation of the algorithm ensures the validity of interpretations drawn from the resulting model\n{partykit}\n\nNotes from: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02921.pdf\ntl;dr procedure\n\nFor each distributional parameter (e.g. mean, sd), a “score” matrix is computed using the target values and the distribution’s likelihood function\nThe score matrix is used to create a test statistic for each predictor\nThe predictor with the lowest p-value associated with its test statistic is the splitting variable\nThe split point is determined by the point that produces the lowest p-value in one of the split regions\nProcess continues for each leaf until no variables produce a p-value below a certain threshold (e.g. α = 0.05)\nThe distributional parameters associated with the leaf that a new observation falls into is used as the prediction for a tree.\n\nTree procedure\n\nFor each distributional parameter (e.g. mean, std.dev), calculate the value of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)\nTake the derivative of the log-likelihood function. Plug in the value(s) of the MLE parameter(s) and a yi value to get a “score” for every value of the response variable. Repeat for each distributional parameter. (The score should fluctuate around zero.)\n\n\nand\n\n\nWhere k is the number of distributional parameters and n is the number of training observations\n\nGaussian example with\n :\n\nSolve for the MLE of the mean and calculate the value:\n\nSolve for the MLE of the variance and calculate the value:\n\nWe’re calculating a score for each value of the outcome variable so we can remove the summation symbol from the derivative of the log-likelihood function w.r.t. the mean. This leaves us with the mean score function:\n\nSame thing but with the derivative of the log-likelihood function w.r.t. the variance:\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis test each predictor variable vs the parameter score matrix where H0 = independence — Two methods: CTree and MOB\n\nCTree is permutation test based\n\nEach test statistic vector, T, for 1,…,l predictors and n observations is calculated by:\n\n\nwhere\n\n\nis the 1xk row of the score matrix and v is a transformation function that depends on whether the predictor variable, Z, is a numeric or character type.\n\n\n\nIf the predictor variable, Z, is a numeric:\n\nv is an identity function, so Z remains unchanged.\nCorresponding to the first observation, the first row of the score matrix is multiplied by the first value of the predictor variable resulting in a 1xk row vector.\nn 1xk row vectors are added together\nThe summed 1xk vector is transposed by the vec function into the k-vector, T.\n\nIf the predictor variable, Z, is a character variable with H categories:\n\nv creates an indicator variable where the hth value is 1 indicates that Zi’s value is the hth category.\nCorresponding to the first observation, we multiply this Hx1 vector times the 1xk, first row of the score matrix which results in a sparse Hxk matrix.\nn Hxk matrices are added together\nvec then stacks each column of the summed Hxk matrix to create a column vector, T, with H*k rows.\n\n\nT is standardized by maximum or quadratic method.\n\nt just represents a statistic that’s calculated from a permutation of the scores. T is handled in the same way.\npartykit::ctree.pdf shows the calculations for μ and Σ\n\n\nwhere Σ+ is the pseudo-inverse of the covariance matrix\n\nCalculating the pseudo-inverse makes this method more computationally intensive\n\nUsing this quadratic method, c is Chi-Square test statistic.\n\n\n\nFor the maximum method, c is Normal test statistic (partykit::ctree.pdf)\nno idea why the numerator has one “k” and the bottom has “kk.” Maybe it’s a typo.\n\n\nFind the p-value associated with each predictor’s c statistic\n\n\n\nThis says the p-value, P, is the probability,\n\n\n, (associated with the null hypothesis for this particular variable) that the standardized T stat is as or more extreme than the group of standardized t stats of the permuted scores.\n\n\n\nis the symmetric group of permutations and weights. Weights being either 0 or 1 depending on whether the observation is present in that node’s data subset.\n\n\n\n\nMOB stands for model based method\n\nUses a M-Fluctuation test to test for an “instability” by calculating a supLM test statistic. An instability is what’s interpreted from a p-value &lt; 0.05\n\n\n\n\nis a minimum amount of scores that you choose, then\n\nNo guidelines for\n\n\nIn addition to choosing a minimum, the paper does mention also trimming node data points at each end by 10%.\n\n\n\nis called “its variance function.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeans floor of nt, which means round down to the integer.\n\nThe subscript\n\n\nsays the scores are ordered from highest to lowest (aka anti-rank) according to the predictor variable, Zj, values\n\n\ncovariance matrix\n\n\nThe distribution from which the p-value is calculated has something to do with a Bessel process and stuff converging to a Brownian Bridge, so I decided to shut it down here.\n\nSee https://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/~zeileis/papers/Zeileis%2BHothorn%2BHornik-2008.pdf for details\n\n\n\nBonferonni adjust the p-value according the number of variables, m\n\n\n\nSelect predictor variables with adjusted p-values lower than the threshold\nFrom that selection, the predictor with the lowest p-value is chosen as the splitting variable.\n\nIf no p-values are lower than the threshold, splitting is halted and the terminal node is reached for that branch (aka pre-pruning).\nPre-pruning not usually done in distributional forests (mincriterion = 0).\n\nChoose the optimal split point for the chosen variable where the lowest p-value is produced in one of the two created sub-regions (i.e the maximum test statistic).\nProcedure is repeated (like traditional trees) in the created leaves and continues until stopping criteria reached (e.g. no p-values lower than threshold, number of observations in node is below minimum, etc)\nIn practice, predicting, using just a tree, involves finding the node with the criterion that fits the new observation and using the estimated distributional parameters of the subsample belonging to that node as the model prediction.\n\nThe paper says this can be thought of as a weighted maximum likelihood estimation. The mathematical notation is similar to what I show below for forests.\n\n\nForest procedure\n\nThe idea of random forests is to train an ensemble of trees, each on diﬀerent training data obtained through resampling or subsampling. In each node only a random subset of the covariates is considered for splitting to reduce the correlation among the trees and to stabilize the variance of the model\nNotes from: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02110.pdf\nPretty good explainer of the weight system used below to calculate predicted means across all leaves in the forest (from {drf} explainer)\n\nInstead of directly calculating the mean in a leaf node, one calculates the weights that are implicitly used when doing the mean calculation. The weight wi(x) is a function of (1) the test point x and (2) an observation i. That is, if we drop x down a tree, we observe in which leaf it ends up. All observations that are in that leaf get a 1, all others 0.\n\nSo if we end up in a leaf with observations (1,3,10), then the weight of observations 1,3,10 for that tree is 1, while all other observations get 0.\n\nWe then further divide that weight by the number of elements in the leaf node.\n\nIn the example before, we had 3 observations in the leaf node, so the weights for observations 1,3, 10 are 1/3 each, while all other observations still get a weight of 0 in this tree. Averaging these weights over all trees gives the final weight wi(x).\n\nCalculating the mean as we do in a traditional Random Forest, is the same as summing up wi(x)*yi\n\nFor predictions:\n\nFor a training observation and a tree, determine whether a new observation z belongs in the same node as the training observation, zi.\nCalculate a weight according to whether the new observation and the training observation are in the same node.\n\nIf they are in the same node\n\n where i denotes the training observation and n is the number of observations in that node of that particular tree, t.\n\nIf zi, the training observation, and the new observation, z, aren’t in the same node\n\nwit = 0\n\n\nCalculate wit for each tree the training observation belongs to.\n\nResampling or subsampling may exclude a training observation from some of the trees\n\nSum all tree weights, wit, for that training observation and divide by the number of trees to get the forest-weight for that training observation.\n\n\n\nWhere Ti is the total trees that use that training observation in its learning sample.\nSo the forest weight is the average weight per tree for that training observation\n\nIn the paper, this process is described by a more compact notation:\n\n\nThe numerator in the end part of this equation indicates whether the bth terminal node, Bb, contains the training observation, zi, and the new observation, z, for tree, t.\n is the number of observations in that terminal node\n\n\nThe paper describes predictions being calculated by a weighted MLE as it did for a single tree, but for forests it didn’t explicitly give an “in practice” description of process.\n\n\n\nEach parameter that has been calculated for each terminal node of each tree has a subset of the learning data associated with it. The forest weight-likelihood products of each observation are summed over this subset. The parameter with the largest sum is chosen as the prediction.\n\nRepeat for each distributional parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{drf}\n\n\nNotes from DRF: A Random Forest for (almost) everything\nUltimately when a RF finishes splitting data, each leaf should ideallly contain a homogeneous set of points in terms of approximating a the conditional distribution, P(Y|X=xi), but this only applies to the conditional mean of that leaf. As seen in the pic, the mean doesn’t fully describe that leaf’s conditional distribution.\n\nEvery distribution except x2 has a similar means, but sets (x1,x4,x6) and (x3, x5, x7) have different variances.\n\ndrf is able to fit a RF with these more homogeneous leaves by transforming the leaf’s yi subsamples into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space with a kernel.\n\nIn this infinite-dimensional space, conditional means are able to fully represent conditional distributions and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is (efficiently) calculated.\nThe MMD measures the similarity between distributions\nThus if the conditional distribution of Y given xi and xj are similar, they will be grouped in the same leaf.\n\ndrf uses the same weighting system for its forest as {partykit} in order to produce predictions."

The first tree might begin by checking if a patient has hypertension, and then if they are older or younger than 65. It might find that people over 65 with hypertension often have a fatal outcome. If so, then whenever those conditions are met, it will move predictions in this direction. The next tree then seeks to improve on the prediction produced by the previous one. Relationships between variables are discovered or refined with each tree.\n\nDifference between XGBoost and LightGBM (Raschka)\n\nXGBoost’s trees are based on breadth-first search, comparing different features at each node.\nLightGBM performs depth-first search, focusing on a single feature & growing the tree from there.\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Gradient boosted machines (GBM)\n\nChoose a differentiable loss function, ρ, such as \n\nIn gradient boosting, 1/n is exchanged for 1/2, to make it differentiable.

According to the price elasticity, which price will increase profit while staying inline with our sales target.\n\nQuestions:\n\nhow many unitss can we expect to sell at a given price?\nHow does a 10% price change affect demand?\n\nData\n\nVariables are time series.\nBasic variables:\n\nPrice\nSales or orders\n\nPotential variables\n\nCompetitor prices\n\nLogging this variable (as with your product’s Price) usually produces the best results.\n\nIn-store alternatives\n\nPrice\nSales\n\nNew promotional activities\n\nDummy variable\n\nSeasonal effects\n\n\nPrice Elasticity of Demand (PED) - measures the responsiveness of the demand to changes in price\n\nAlmost always negative – except for luxury goods (Veblen) and Giffen goods(?)\n\nA positive elasticity can indicate an omitted variable.\n\n\n  means relatively inelastic where demand hardly changes in response to a change in price\n  means relatively elastic where demand is responsive to price changes\n  means unitary elastic where revenue is maximized and price is optimized\n\nCoefficients aren’t decimal percents (e.g. the regression coefficient of 1% elasticity will be 1 not 0.01)\nCoefficient interpreted as a 1% increase in Price results in a &lt;β1&gt; percent change in Demand.\n\nCommon Models\n\n\n\nWhere Y = demand (e.g. sales, orders), and X is price\nLog-Log fits more closely with economic theory and is usually the optimal choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese costs can be per day, per month, etc.\n\n\n\nOptimal price doesn’t depend on fixed costs\n\n\nCross Price Elasticity - The responsiveness of demand for your product to changes in a competitor’s price\n\nPositive values are common. Higher prices of a competitor (substitutional good) should result in increase sales for your product. Thus, a positive elasticity.\nNegative values can occur if the competitor raises prices on a complementary good, which is good that is often purchased along with your product.\n\nA rise in the price of oil filters many depress sales of engine oil.\n\n\n\nAdvanced Log-Log model:\n\nAdditionally includes Competitor Price and dummy variables for a Promotional Campaign and Summer months\n\n\nUse price elasticity of demand (PED) to find the price required to meet a sales target\n\nCobb-Douglas function\n\n\n\nQ(p) is quantity sold as a function of price, p\nA is forecasted sales\nε is the PED\nQ0 is our sales target\nQ0 - Q(p) = 0 since we want our quantity sold to equal our sales target\n\n\nWe can use ARIMA, ETS, etc to forecast sales for the period that Q0 covers, model the price elasticity, and then calculate the price.\n\nUsed CIs for the PED to give a range of prices\n\nI’d also incorporate the forecast CIs"

    "text": "2.3 Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)\n\nNotes from: http://freerangestats.info/blog/2019/11/24/cost-benefit-analysis\nAlso see\n\nProject Management &gt;&gt; Decision Model\nVideo Bizsci learning lab 68\n\n{tidyquant} has excel functions for Net Present Value (NPV), Future Value of Cashflow (FV), and Present Value of Future Cashflow (PV)\nNet Present Value - the real value of benefits in today’s dollars minus the real value of costs (where the “real” value means future values are discounted by some chosen discount rate - the choice of which makes a big difference to how much the analysis values either the short term or the long term)\n\n\n\nm is the number of years (or whatever time unit) for the investment\nbenefit is the benefit value (e.g. revenue) for each year of the investment (vector)\ncost is the cost value for each year of the investment (vector)\nCost and benefit must have the same unit of measurement (e.g. dollars) and be vectors of equal length.\ndiscount is the discount rate (decimal)\n\nMinimum expected return on investment. 10% is common and 5% is usually the minimum, i.e. a replacement-level ROI. If the discount rate is 10% percent, then that says that the current investment strategies are yielding at least 10%, so this one should be at least that good. The thinking is, “why spend money on this investment if it has a lower discount rate instead of putting it to work in one of the other strategies that’s yielding at least 10%?”\nExample references New Zealand and Australia governmental guidelines for various departments that range from 5-7%.\n\nNotice i starts at 0 and goes to m-1 (investment window remains unchanged). This is because the initial year is “discounted” (whatever that means). The discount quantity in the equation goes to 1 when i = 0, so it’s not a factor in the calculation for the initial year.\nBasic Simulation: Can use the Gamma Distribution to sample different random values for costs and benefits. Then plug into a npv function with a specified discount rate to get a simulated distribution of potential values. Visualize with a density graph.\n\nThis models the potential uncertainty with costs and benefits.\n\n\n\nInternal Rate of Return - the discount rate at which benefits break even with costs\n\nIf the internal rate of return is higher than your cost of capital (aka hurdle rate) and higher than the rate of return of other uses of capital, then it is worth investing in.\n\ncost of capital typically calculated as Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n\nProject, Planning &gt;&gt; Decision Models &gt;&gt; Terms &gt;&gt; Cost of Capital, Internal Rate of Return\nMorgan Stanley’s Guide to Cost of Capital (Also in R &gt;&gt; Documents &gt;&gt; Business)\n\nThread about the guide\n\nWACC = w1*cost_of_equity + w2*cost_of_debt\n\nw1, w2 depend on the company’s capital structure (e.g. 70% equity, 30% debt)\nCAPM = Rf + β (Rm - Rf)\n\ncost_of_equity approximated using capital asset pricing model (CAPM)\nRf = risk-free rate of return\nRm = market rate of return\nβ = risk estimate or a company’s stock beta or a similar public company’s stock beta\n\ncost_of_debt = (interest_expense / total_debt) * (1 - T)\n\ninterest_expense = interest paid on company’s current debt\n\nSince interest expense is tax-deductible, the debt is calculated on an after-tax basis\n\nT = company’s marginal tax rate\n\n\nAs of January 2019, transportation in railroads has the highest cost of capital at 11.17%. The lowest cost of capital can be claimed by non-bank and insurance financial services companies at 2.79%. The cost of capital is also high among both biotech and pharmaceutical drug companies, steel manufacturers, Internet (software) companies, and integrated oil and gas companies.Those industries tend to require significant capital investment in research, development, equipment, and factories.\n\n\nCompute with an optimization function\n\nCan calculate for specific cost, benefit, and discount rate or use the simulated values (above) to get a density of potential values.\n\n\nMore Complicated Case - benefit and cost, can be broken down into parts with uncertainty included in each estimate\n\ncost = c(initial_cost, remaining_costs)\n\ninitial_cost = rnorm(n=1, mean = initial_cost_est, sd = initial_cost*uncertainty)\n\nuncertainty = 0.10 in the example\n“_est” variables or constants are just the initial estimates (given to us from marketing or whoever the stakeholders are)\n\nremaining_costs = fixed_costs + ad_hoc_costs\n\nongoing_costs = rnorm(n=m-1, mean = fixed_costs,, sd = fixed_costs*uncertainty)\n\nm = investment window\n\nad_hoc_costs = rbinom(n=m-1, size = 1, p = ad_hoc_prob)\n\ncosts that occur that weren’t planned for\n\n\n\nbenefits = customers * customer_spend\n\ncustomers = customer_level_shift * (1 + customer_growth) ^ (0 : m-1) # m-1 since starting at 0\n\ncustomer_level_shift = rnorm(1, customer_level_shif_est, customer_level_shift * uncertainty)\n\nlevel shift is described as the number of customers attained in year 0.\n\ncustomer_growth = rnorm(1, customer_growth_est, customer_growth_est * uncertainty)\n\ngrowth of the customer base after year 0\n\n\ncustomer_spend = rnorm(1, customer_spend_est, customer_spend_est * uncertainty)"

Such imbalances will be quite common when, for instance, items of hugely different prices are involved.\n\nExample: When someone buys a house, for example, they may want to buy a bookcase, but buying a bookcase doesn’t mean someone wants to buy a house: this would be an instance of one-sided complementarity.\nMe: So choosing recommendations should take into consideration the price of item in the cart and select one-sided asymmetries with high confidences that are similar to that price or less.\n\nTolerances categorize and rank pairs of products\n\nComplementary at such-and-such a tolerance level – 0%, 1%, 5%, etc. – generating a score of sorts.\nIn cases where a dot representing the two-way dependencies between two items falls within a narrow band – corresponding to a smaller tolerance – the more inseparable the items are, and the more sensible a cross-selling recommendation may become."

(See article in LightFM)\nSort by rating in descending order for each user. Otherwise, the metrics will be bad.\nFrom the model predictions, items already “seen” by the user should be removed from the predictions\nIf you have low metrics, for example PrecisionK below 0.1, and you don’t know what the reason is — the data or the model, or maybe the metric calculation\n\nCheck the sparsity index of your user/item matrix (see Metrics &gt;&gt; Misc)\nUse the MovieLens (.zip) dataset and train your model on it.\n\nIf its metrics are low on MovieLens too, then the cause is in the model\nif the metrics are good, then the likely cause lies in the preprocessing and postprocessing stages.\n\n\nIf Random model and Most popular model (baseline models) metrics are close to ML models, it is worth checking the data — maybe the number of unique items is too low.\n\nThis can also happen if we have very little data, or maybe there is a bug in the training code.\n\nIf values higher than 0.5 for Precision@k look too high and it is worth checking if there is a bug in the script or if we are lowering the sparsity index too much.\nAlways compare how many users and items you have left after lowering the sparsity index. Sometimes in the pursuit of quality you can lose almost all users, so you should look for a compromise.\nIf you already have a model in production, select the most promising candidates for online AB testing on KPIs.

This prevents new items or new vendors from getting exposure.\nSolution: Initially make the probability of a recommended item uniform (with some regard to category, etc.) and collect ratings.

Makes me think there could be a score based on hate-speech or radicalism using sentiment analysis that could be included into the ranking algorithm that would make more ethical recommendations\n\nComplimentary item recommendation\n\nRecommender that’s similar to market basket analysis in that it recommends items that are often bought together with item being purchased.\nResources\n\nHow to provide complementary item recommendations in e-commerce marketplaces\n\n\nFiltering Features Based on Contextual Dimensions\n\ne.g. When the movie is watched or if the user is watching the movie with family or friends (which room it’s watched in might hint at this?)\nNotes from Engineering Features for Contextual Recommendation Engines\nTraditional embedding techniques grows exponentially with the number of contextual dimensions (i.e. see multiverse as an example), alternative approaches like factorization machines can be employed to preserve tractability.\nUsing multi-layer perceptrons vs. matrix factorization, there is more flexibility in how embeddings are derived and used to find the most similar items to users. For example, embeddings can be learned whereby different dimensions have different weights in determining the users location in space.\nAn outcome could be explicit feedback like a rating, implicit feedback like watch time, or a non-feedback quantity like price.\nScenario: Outcome = F(I,C)\n\nItems (I) and context (C) play a dominant role in the recommender, whereas the user takes a backseat.\n\ne.g. New users with limited user-item history\n\nCategoricals are 1-hot encoded and aggregation calculations of numerics per category. Then, the category and the new numeric are combined.\n\nExample\n\n\ne.g.\n\navg_rating_work_photography = photography (1-hot) x AVG Rating (for photography work) = 2.92 for this prospective employee\n\n\nTherefore, each unit/subject has only 1 row.\n\nTo avoid unnecessary complexity and large dimension spaces, features are filtered based on the user’s context\n\nExample: Filling a medium scope, medium budget photography job using a jobs website (see above table)\n\nIf prospective employee has other skills besides those pertaining to photography, then those are filtered out\nSo, in the above table, variables with “work_photography”, “adobe_photoshop”, “scope_medium”, “budget_medium”, and all the experience variables would be included in the dimension space and the rest would be discarded\n\nInteractions like AVG Ratings when both the Budget == medium and the experience level == expert are not considered.\nNon-linearities can still be derived by the training algorithm, or additional contextual dimensions can be created as the the product of existing ones.\n\nA tree model (e.g. XGBoost) is trained using this dataset with the outcome being some kind of feedback column (e.g. from employers that hired the person for a job).\n\nThis model’s predictions are used to produce recommendations with this particular context but I’m not sure how that’s supposed to work.\n\n\nScenario: Outcome = F(U, C)\n\nThe recommendation isn’t for a discrete item, but rather a continuous value.\n\ne.g. a platform recommending the price a property rental company should charge for a property on a weekend.\n\n\nQuestions\n\n“We can rebuild this representation now considering each past job as the current job, stacking each past job as a set of additional rows. For past jobs, we can create an additional column to capture explicit feedback received by the freelancer such as being hired, or implicit feedback like being messaged.”\nNo idea what “talent” is"

As a rule, it increases the retention rate and has a positive impact on revenue.\nCan be measured in many different ways\n\nAverage similarity for top_n.\nMedian value of the number of unique genres (e.g. movies, books) or another category in hierarchy of product categories.\n\n\nMean Reciprocal Rank\n\\[\n\\mbox{score}_i = \\frac{1}{\\mbox{rank}_i}\n\\]\n\n(Wiki)\nScores based the rank the recommender model gave the “correct” recommendation when it supplied it’s list of recommendations.

This makes sense because in that case we do not have any recommended item that is not relevant.\n\n\nRecall@k\n\nThe proportion of relevant items found in the top-k recommendations\nRecall@k = (# of k recommended items that match the observed relevant scores) / (total # of true relevant items)\nk is a user definable integer that is set by the user to match the top-n recommendations objective (i.e. k = n)\nExample: 40% recall means on average 40% of the total number of the (observed) relevant items appear in the top-n results.\nIssue: If there are no items recommended. i.e. number of recommended items at k is zero, we cannot compute precision at k since we cannot divide by zero.\n\nIn that case we set recall@k to be 1. This makes sense because we do not have any relevant items that are not identified in our top-k results.\n\n\nRelevance - A relevant item for a specific user-item pair means that this item is a good recommendation for the user in question.\n\nExample: User/Movie\n\n\nAssume that any true (i.e. observed) rating above 3.0 corresponds to a relevant item and any true rating below 3.0 is irrelevant.\n\nThe threshold is subjective. There are multiple ways to set this threshold value such as taking into consideration the history of ratings given by the user.\n\nUnder the above definition, the movies in the first 2 rows are “relevant” to those users, and the last three movies would be “irrelevant” to those users\n\n\nRecommended - Items are generated by recommendation algorithm with a predicted rating greater than the relevance threshold\nIn calculations, ignore all the ratings where the actual value is not known\n\nRecList (article, article) - Behavior tests; black-box-ish py library that takes a sort of sentiment analysis approach to grading recommenders\n\n{checklist} for recommender systems (see Diagnostics, NLP &gt;&gt; Behavioral Tests &gt;&gt; Misc &gt;&gt; Packages)\nPrinciples\n\nComplementary and similar items satisfy different logical relations\n\nWhile similar items are interchangeable, complementary ones may have a natural ordering\ne.g. Recommend hdmi cable if a tv is bought, but not a tv if a hdmi cable is bought.\n\nNot all mistakes are equally bad\n\nExample: Truth: When Harry Met Sally\n\nRecommending Terminator is a worse miss than You’ve Got Mail\n\n\nSome groups are more important than others\n\nTolerate a small decrease in overall accuracy if a subset of users we care about is happier\nExample: Promoting Nike products so if the recommender results in substantial increased Nike Sales, for Italian users on iphones it becomes terrible, then that’s an acceptable trade-off\n\n\n\nRGRecSys (Salesforce)\n\nEvaluation toolkit that encompasses multiple dimensions - robustness with respect to sub-populations, transformations, distributional disparity, attack, and data sparsity\nGithub\nPaper"

What are her past experiences with the recommendation placement?\nContext: What is going on at that moment? What are the user’s needs?\n\nThere are many contexts where similarity is not required or can worsen recommendations. For example, users might want a change of pace or mood from that horror movie they just watched. Also, does the user stick to a specific genre (e.g., Korean dramas) or hop around diverse genres? A better understanding will help improve the user experience.\n\n\nDifferent data splitting strategies (for train and validation) can affect the relative performance of recommendation systems in offline evaluation\n\nSplitting strategies\n\nLeave-one-last: Leave one last item, leave one last basket/session\nTemporal: Temporal split within each user, temporal split (on same date) globally\nRandom: For each user, split interactions into train and test data\nUser: Split some users into train, the rest into test\n\nRelative performance of recommenders changed often across splitting strategies (indicated by the rank swaps)\n\n\nModel Evaluation\n\nSR-GNN: Best hit rate, mean reciprocal rank, and nDCG\nV-STAN: Best precision, recall, and mean average precision\nV-SKNN, GRU4Rec: Best coverage and popularity\nSTAMP: Satisfactory in all metrics\nUsing human experts to evaluate recommendations\n\nIn contrast to the offline evaluation metrics, human experts found GRU4Rec to have very relevant recommendations. However, because its recommendations did not match the IDs of products added to cart, GRU4Rec did not perform as well on offline evaluation metrics.\nSTAMP and GRU4Rec performed best in the second step and STAMP was put through an A/B test. This led to a 15.6% increase in CTR and an 18.5% increase in revenue per session.\n\n\nSimilarity\n\nMatrix factorization faster w/sufficient regularization outperformed and was faster than DL approaches\n\nAdding unexpectedness to recommendations to add freshness\n\nTwo kinds\n\nPersonalized: Some users are variety seekers and thus more open to new videos\nSession-based: If a user finishes the first episode of a series, it’s better to recommend the next episode.

I need sound root cause analysis before I adjust my manufacturing process.” (see variable importance tracking)\n“Anomaly detection is not enough: when a model detects an anomaly, it’s already too late. I need prediction to justify investing time and effort into such an approach.” (see event rates)\n“I need prescription: tell me what I should do to prevent a failure from happening.” (see variable importance tracking)\n\nCommon Criticisms\n\n“There are some false positives, I don’t have time to investigate each event!” (see event rates)\n“Your model only detects anomalies when they already happened, it’s useless!“ (see event rates)\n“I have hundreds of sensors: when an anomaly is detected by your model, I still have to investigate my whole operations, I’m not saving any time here!” (see variable importance tracking)\n\nAmazon Lookout for Equipment - managed service from AWS dedicated to anomaly detection\nAny abnormal event visible in your time series will either be a:\n\nPrecursor Event\nDetectable Anomaly (forewarning about a future event)\nA Failure\nMaintenance Activity\nHealing Period (while your industrial process recovers after an issue)\n\nTypes\n\nShocks - abrupt changes, spikes\nLevel Shifts - can happen when a given time series shifts between range of values based on underlying conditions or operating modes.\n\nLevel – The average value for a specific time period\nIf you want to consider all operating modes when detecting anomalies, you need to take care to include all of them in your training data\n\nTrending: a set of signals can change over time (not necessarily in the same direction).\n\nWhen you want to assess the condition of a process or of a piece of equipment, these trending anomalies will be great precursors events to search. They will help you build forewarning signals before actual failures may happen.\n\n\nUse average event rates to filter out false positives and predict an upcoming event\n\n\nTake action if the event rate (i.e. rate of predicted events) starts to grow too large (allowing you to move from detecting to predicting)\n\ne.g. You can decide to only notify an operator after the daily event rate reaches at least 200 per day. This would allow you to only react to 3 events out of the 41 detected (aka predicted) during this period\n\nUse historical event data to calculate an event rate threshold\nBy only reacting after a threshold predicted event rate has been reached, you filter out false positives (when scarce events are detected)\n\nTrack variable importance over time to narrow the field of potential causes of an event\n\n\n2 stacked column charts represent two anomalous events.\nEach color is a predictor variable (e.g. sensor) that was important to the prediction of the event.\n\nOnly need to focus on a few (e.g. top five predictor variables)\n\nUse to examine false positives and actual events\n\n\nFor the false positive (left)\n\nThe percentage of importance attributed the top 5 is much less than that for an actual event\nRed is less important and Yellow is more important than when there’s an actual event\n\n\n\nRolling Spectral Entropy\n\n\n\nSpectral Entropy is the normalized (power) spectral density )(PSD)\nMisc\n\nNotes from Anomaly Detection in Univariate Stochastic Time Series with Spectral Entropy\n\nGuidelines\n\nA series which has strong trend and seasonality (and so is easy to forecast) will have entropy close to 0.\n\nIn the case of noisy time series, this indicates an anomaly.\n\nA series that is very noisy (and so is difficult to forecast) will have entropy close to 1.\n\nExample\n\ndef spectral_entropy(x, freq, nfft=None):   \n    _, psd = periodogram(x, freq, nfft = nfft)   \n    # calculate shannon entropy of normalized psd\n    psd_norm = psd / np.sum(psd)\n    entropy = np.nansum(psd_norm * np.log2(psd_norm))\n    return -(entropy / np.log2(psd_norm.size))\n\nwindow = 200\nnfft = None\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data=x, columns=['x'])\ndf['x_roll_se'] = df['x'].rolling(window).apply(lambda x: spectral_entropy(x,freq=100,nfft=nfft))\n\nIf the FFT size is not specified, we will use the window size"

Algorithm related to binary search.\nNotes from paper: https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf\nThe tree algorithm chooses a predictor at random for the root node. Then randomly chooses either the minimum or the maximum of that variable as the splitting value. The algorithm recursively subsamples like normal trees (choosing variables and split points in the same manner) until each terminal node has one data point or replicates of the same data point or preset maximum tree height is reached. Across the trees of a forest, anomalies with have a shorter average path length from root to terminal node.\n\nThe algorithm is basically looking for observations with combinations of variables that have extreme values. The process of continually splitting subsamples of data will run out data points and be reduced to a single observation more quickly for an anomalous observation than a common observation.\nMakes sense. Picturing a tree structure, there shouldn’t be too many observations with more that a few minimums/maximums of variable values. The algorithm weeds out these observations as it moves down the tree structure.\n\nAny or all of these wouldn’t necessarily be global minimum/maximums since we’re dealing with subsamples of variable values as we move down the tree.\n\nPaper has some nice text boxes with pseudocode that goes through the steps of the algorithm.\n\nAnomaly scores range from 0 to 1. Observations with a shorter average path length will have a larger score.\n\nAnomaly score\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&s(x_i, n) = 2^{-\\frac{\\mathbb{E}(h(x_i))}{c(n)}}\\\\\n&\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{where}\\quad c(n) &= 2H(n-1) - \\frac{2(n-1)}{n} \\\\\nH(i) &= \\ln(i) + \\gamma\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\mathbb{E}(h(x_i))\\) is the average path length across the isolation forest for that observation\n\\(H(i)\\) is the harmonic number and \\(\\gamma\\) is Euler’s constant\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe closer an observation’s score is to 1 the more likely that it is an anomaly\nThe closer to zero, the more likely the observation isn’t an anomaly.\nObservations with scores around 0.5 means that the algorithm can’t find a distinction."

Then there’s no need to specify the config parameter when creating a connection\n\nYou can also specify an alternate configuration filename or location by setting the file parameter in spark_config()\nCan also change the default configuration by changing the value of the R_CONFIG_ACTIVE environment variable. See the GitHub rstudio/config repo for additional information\n\n\n\n\n\nPartitioning\n\nIdeally, Spark organises one thread per task and per CPU core\nIncreasing partitions can help performance but don’t create too many partitions\n\nThere is a deterioration of I/O performance due to the operations performed by the file system (e.g. opening, closing, listing files), which is often amplified with a distributed file system like HDFS.\nScheduling problems can also be observed if the number of partitions is too large.\n\nTypes\n\nImplicit: type of partitioning already present in the storage system\n\ne.g. directory tree of Arrow files that have been partitioned; table schema in a relational db (?)\n(default) it’s more effective to run computations where the data is already located\n\nExplicit: Manaully setting the number of partitions (i.e. repartitioning)\n\nUseful when when you have many more or far fewer compute instances than data partitions. In both cases, it can help to repartition data to match your cluster resources\nVarious data functions, like spark_read_csv() or copy_to(), already support a repartition parameter to request that Spark repartition data appropriately\n\nAlso,spark_df %&gt;% sdf_repartition(4)(e.g. repartitions a Spark DataFrame to have 4 partitions)\n\nShould be shown as the spark.sql.shuffle.partitions parameter in the webui or config\n\nsdf_coalesce(x, partitions) can reduce the number of partitions without shuffling\n\n\n\nCheck number of partitions for a data object\nsdf_len(sc, 10) %&gt;% sdf_num_partitions()\n&gt;&gt; 2\n\nsdf_len creates a spark df with a sequence length (e.g. 10 in this toy example)\n\nI think this a numeric vector in R but they just call everything a df in Spark\n\nI think the default is set the partitions to the number of cores/instances that are being used in the cluster\n\n\n\n\nCaching\n\nFunctions like spark_read_parquet() or copy_to() load/cache data objects into memory (aka resilient distributed dataset (RDD))\n\nSave data from being lost when a worker fails\ntbl_uncache(sc, \"iris\") can be used to free up memory by removing a RDD from cache\n\nInspect RDDs through the UI (Storage Tab &gt;&gt; )\n\nCheckpoints\n\nsdf_checkpoint caches a spark dataframe or an object thats coerceable to a spark dataframe\n\nUseful during analysis after computationally intensive calculations so that you don’t have to repeat them\n\nThere is a cost to writing these results to disk, so you might need to test whether the calculation is intensive enough for checkpointing to be more efficient.\n\nspark_set_checkpoint_dir() spark_get_checkpoint_dir() are for setting and getting the location of the cache directory\nCache is deleted after the end of the spark session\n\n\n\n\n\nShuffling\n\n\nSpark stores the intermediate results of a shuffle operation on the local disks of the executor machines, so the quality of the disks, especially the I/O quality, is really important.\n\nThe use of SSD disks will significantly improve performance for this type of transformation\n\nSort Merge (Default) requires full shuffling of both data sets via network which is heavy task for Spark\n\nOther Joins: Docs\n\n\n\nBroadcast Joins\n\n** Think this only needs to be explicitly specified for Spark 2.x. Spark 3.0 has Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) which uses the optimal type of join automatically. **\n\nVideo\nMay need Databricks (runtime &gt;7.0) to get AQE and set spark.sql.adaptive.enabled = TRUE in the config\n\nUseful when one df is orders of magnitude smaller than the one you’re joining it too\n\nIt pushes one of the smaller DataFrames to each of the worker nodes to reduce shuffling the bigger DataFrame\nBy duplicating the smallest table, the join no longer requires any significant data exchange in the cluster apart from the broadcast of this table beforehand\nIf you are joining two data sets and both are very large, then broadcasting any table would kill your spark cluster and fails your job.\n\nCan be set according to difference in size in bytes using spark.sql.autoBroadcastHashJoin (not sure if this is available in {sparklyr}\n\nDefault = 10 MB difference in sizes\nSetting to -1 means spark always uses a broadcast join (maybe useful with sufficient memory available)\n\nAdjust (increase?) spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold to get smaller tables broadcasted\n\nShould be done to ensure sufficient driver and executor memory\nSetting to -1 disables it\n\nIssues\n\nNot Applicable for Full Outer Join.\nFor Inner Join, executor memory should accommodate at least smaller of the two input dataset. (See Iterative Broadcast Joins below as a potential solution)\nFor Left , Left Anti and Left Semi Joins, executor memory should accommodate the right input dataset as the right one needs to be broadcasted.\nFor Right , Right Anti and Right Semi Joins, executor memory should accommodate the left input dataset as the left one needs to be broadcasted.\nThere is also a considerable demand of execution memory on executors based on the size of broadcasted dataset.\n\nExample:\nsdf_len(sc, 10000) %&gt;%\n  sdf_broadcast() %&gt;%\n  left_join(sdf_len(sc, 100))\n\n\n\nIterative Broadcast Joins\n\n** Limited to Inner Joins only**\nAn adaption of ‘Broadcast Hash’ join in order to handle larger skewed datasets. It is useful in situations where either of the input dataset cannot be broadcasted to executors. This may happen due to the constraints on the executor memory limits.\nBreaks downs one of the input data set (preferably the smaller one) into one or more smaller chunks thereby ensuring that each of the resulting chunk can be easily broadcasted.\n\nOutputs from these multiple joins is finally combined together using the ‘Union’ operator to produce the final output.\n\nProcess\n\n\nAssign a random number out of the desired number of chunks to each record of the Dataset in a newly added column, ‘chunkId’.\nA for-loop is initiated to iterate on chunk numbers. For each iteration:\n\nRecords are filtered on the ‘chunkId’ column corresponding to current iteration chunk number.\nThe filtered dataset, in each iteration, is then joined with the unbroken other input dataset using the standard ‘Broadcast Hash’ Join to get the partial joined output.\nThe partial joined output is then combined with the previous partial joined output.\n\nAfter the loop is exited, one would get the overall output of the join operation of the two original datasets\n\n\n\n\n\nSerialization\n\nKryo Serializer that can provide performance improvements over the default Java Serializer\nconfig &lt;- spark_config()\nconfig$spark.serializer &lt;- \"org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer\"\n\n\n\nUnion Operator\n\ne.g. df = df1.union(df2).union(df3) (article)\nIf users don’t use union on entirely different data sources, union operators will face a potential performance bottleneck — Catalyst isn’t “smart” to identify the shared data frames to reuse.\nEnsure rows follow the same structure:\n\nThe number of columns must be identical.\nColumn data types should match\nThe column names should follow the same sequence for each data frame. Nevertheless, that’s not mandatory.\n\nThe first data frame will be chosen as the default for the column name. So mixing order can potentially cause an undesired result.\nSpark unionByName is intended to resolve this issue.\n\n\nunionAll is an alias to union that doesn’t remove duplication. We’d need to add distinct after performing union to perform SQL-like union operations without duplication.\nTypical Use Case\n\n\n“Fact 1” and “Fact 2” are 2 large tables that have been joined and split (e.g. filtering) into subsets. Each subset uses different transformations, and eventually, we combine those 4 data frames into the final one.\nSince Catalyst doesn’t recognize these are the same dfs, it performs the two big table join four times!\n\nSolutions\n\nDouble the number of executors to run more concurrent tasks\nHint to Catalyst and let it reuse the joined data frame from memory through caching\n\nExample: Caching\n## Perform inner join on df1 and df2\ndf = df1.join(df2, how=\"inner\", on=\"value\")\n\n## add cache here\ndf.cache()\n\n## Split the joined result into two data frames: one only contains the odd numbers, another one for the even numbers\ndf_odd = df.filter(df.value % 2 == 1)\ndf_even = df.filter(df.value % 2 == 0)\n\n## Add a transformation with a field called magic_value which is generated by two dummy transformations.\ndf_odd = df_odd.withColumn(\"magic_value\", df.value+1)\ndf_even = df_even.withColumn(\"magic_value\", df.value/2)\n\n## Union the odd and even number data frames\ndf_odd.union(df_even).count()\n\nReduces the plan from 50 to 32 stages"

The tasks need to cooperate and announce when the control will be switched out. And all this is done in a single thread with the await command. (article)\nThreading — Uses multiple threads and takes turns to run the code. It achieves concurrency with pre-emptive multitasking which means we cannot determine when to run which code in which thread. It’s the operating system that determines which code should be run in which thread. The control can be switched at any point between threads by the operating system. This is why we often see random results with threading (article)\nBody — information that is sent to the server. (Can’t use with GET requests.)\nEndpoint — a part of the URL you visit.

Take product cannibalization, for example: In retail, a successful product pulls demand away from similar items in its category.\nHence, each entity may have a different distribution. Plus, we should find a way to model their correlation, since independence is seldom feasible in most practical scenarios.\n\nNotes\n\nA copula is a multivariate distribution that can be formed from a variety of underlying distributions (e.g. gamma, normal, beta) with a specified correlation structure (depending on the type of copula you choose). You create one of these copulas from your data, and sample from it. These samples are used to run simulations on.\n\nExample:\n\nTake return prices from a few correlated stocks and create a copula.\nTrain a model with economic predictors and your sampled copula data as the response.\nFeed values for you economic predictors that indicate an economic state (e.g. recession) to your model and forecast the response to see how that group of stocks reacts.\n\n\nThe specified correlation stucture is called the “dependence structure.”\n\ne.g. asymetrical correlation or tail correlation\n\nThe Gaussian copula is typically described as \\(\\Phi_R (\\Phi^{-1}(u_1), \\ldots, \\Phi^{-1}(u_d))\\), but each \\(u\\) is NOT a variable in your data. Each \\(u\\) is the result of feeding a variable of your data through its ECDF. That result is always a uniform random variable with 0,1 parameters, \\(\\mathcal{U}(0,1)\\), hence the “u.” So that copula definition is equivalent to \\(\\Phi_R (\\Phi^{-1}(F_1(X_i), \\ldots, \\Phi^{-1}(F_d(X_d))\\) where \\(X_i\\) is one of your data variables and \\(F_i\\) is its ECDF.\nEach ECDF of your data is a marginal distribution is often simply referred to as a “marginal.”\n{vinecopula} and {copula} have a function called pobs which feeds your data through an ecdf and scales it by (n+1). Didn’t know it had to be scaled, so maybe an ecdf doesn’t always output values between 0 and 1 like a cdf does."

For every pair, \\((u_1, u_2)\\), drawn from the pair’s quantile, we define the *bivariate copula, \\(C: [0,1] \\times [0,1] \\rightarrow [0,1]\\) as:\n\\[\n\\begin {align}\nC(u_1, u_2) &= P(U_1 \\leq u_1, U_2 \\leq u_2) \\\\\n            &= P(S_1 \\leq F_1^{-1}(u_1), S_1 = F_2^{-1}(u2)) \\\\\n            &= H(F_1^{-1}(u_1), F_2^{-1}(u_2))\n\\end {align}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(F_1^{-1}\\) and \\(F_2^{-1}\\) are inverses (i.e. solved for S) of the marginal CDFs, \\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\).\nA copula is just the joint cumulative density for quantiles of a pair of random variables.\n\\(H\\) is “some” function. It varies with the type of copula (see types section).\nSee Probability notebook, “Simulation of a random variable values of a distribution using the distribution’s cdf” section and bookmarks similarly named for some intuition behind what’s happening in Sklar’s Theorem\n\nIf the 1st quantile is from 0 to 0.25 then randomly select some numbers in that range using U(0,1)\n\nThis is unclear to me, he might be calling every number drawn from U(0,1) a “quantile”\nBut I think because you’re using quantiles it’s non-linear which kind a makes sense (thinking about why quantile regression is used sometimes), so maybe he is talking about deciles, quartiles, etc.\nMaybe (see third line of this section) each quantile is treated as a separate dateset where numbers are drawn from U(0,1) and copula calculated.\n\nFind the inverse CDF of the distribution\nPlug those numbers from the 1st quantile into the inverse CDF to get the simulated values\nRepeat for other random variable\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot crosshair says of the value of the inverse CDF of variable U using input 0.1 corresponds to the value of the inverse CDF of variable V using input 0.3. The closer the points are to the y = x line the greater the association between them (like a Q-Q plot)\nMathematically the cumulative conditional probabilities shown in the scatter plot are given by taking partial derivatives of the joint inverse CDF:\n\n\nAside: taking the derivative of a (not inverse) marginal (not joint) CDF is the pdf\n\nThe copula density is defined as:\n\n\nWhich is a probability density. Larger the copula density, the denser the clump of points in the scatter plot\n\n\nCoefficients of Lower and Upper Tail Dependence: quantifies the strength of association during joint tail events for each random variable’s distribution\n\nNot discernible from plots, so needs to be calculated\nUpper tail dependencies refers to the how closely two variables increase together during an extreme “positive” event\n\ne.g. How strongly 2 stocks move together during an huge gain\nLower tail dependencies are similar except the event is in extreme “negative” direction\n\nFor stocks at least, lower tail dependencies tend to be much stronger than upper tail tendencies\n\nTypes\n\nNot including the actual bivariate copula formulas because I’m not sure how the “H” (see bivariate copula def above) works in practice (and I don’t want to frustrate future me). I am including descriptions and important characteristics which should have practical applicability. See article for copula formulas.\nArchimedean\n\nParametric and uniquely determined by generator functions, φ, that use a parameter, θ\n\nθ measures how “closely” the two random variables are “related”, and its exact range and interpretation are different across different Archimedean copulas\nGenerators seem to act like the inverse CDFs in the bivariate copula formula\nGenerators:\n\n\nSymmetric and scalable to multiple variables, although a closed-form solution may not be available in higher dimensions\n\nElliptical\n\nSymmetric and easily extended to multiple variables\nAssumes symmetry on both upward co-moves and downward moves (i.e. lacks flexibility)\nGaussian - uses Gaussian inverse CDF and a correlation matrix\nStudent-t - similar as Gaussian but with degrees of freedom\n\nMixed\n\nWeighted ensemble of the copulas above\nHelps with overfitting and more finely calibrating upper and lower tail dependencies\nWeights should sum to 1\n\nOther Notes\n\nThe wording below is a bit confusing\n\n“Don’t have” I think means doesn’t have the capability to detect or isn’t sensitive to\n“Stronger center dependence” might mean a greater ability to detect or maybe a center dependence bias\n\nI’m not even sure what a “center” dependency means\n\n\nFrank and Gaussian copulas don’t have tail dependencies\n\nGaussian contributed to 2008 financial crisis\n\nFrank copula has a stronger center dependence than a Gaussian (?)\nCopulas with upper tail dependence: Gumbel, Joe, N13, N14, Student-t.\nCopulas with lower tail dependence: Clayton, N14 (weaker than upper tail), Student-t.\nStudent t copula emphasizes extreme results: it is usually good for modelling phenomena where there is high correlation in the extreme values (the tails of the distribution).\n\nNote also that the correlation is symmetrical, so the strength of correlation is the same for both tails. This might be an issue for some applications.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nDefinition\n\n\nCopulas are joint cumulative distribution functions (c.d.f.) for unit-uniform random variables\n\nProbability integral transform\n\n\nStates that we can transform any continuous random variable to a uniform one by plugging it into its own c.d.f.\nTransform a uniform random variable to any continuous random variable\n\n\nSo plugging a Uniform random variable into the quantile function which is the inverse of the cdf and outputs a continuous random variable\n\n\nGaussian Copula\n\n\nExample\n\nDefining a (generic) Copula (aka joint cdf) for two random variables\n\n\nWhere FX(x), FY(y) are cdfs of Gamma, Beta distributions respectively\n\nDefining a Gaussian Copula for these 2 random variables\n\n\nFormat: Copula = joint cdf(quantile(cdf(gamma_random_variable), cdf(gamma_random_variable))\n\nConstruct a Copula\n\nTransform the Gamma and Beta marginals into Uniform marginals via the respective c.d.f.s\nTransform the Uniform marginals into standard Normal marginals via the quantile functions\nDefine the joint distribution via the multivariate Gaussian c.d.f. with zero mean, unit variance and non-zero covariance (covariance matrix R)\n\nSample from a Copula\n\nThe bi-variate random variable has the above properties.

    "text": "4.2 Cross-Correlation Function (CCF)\n\nThe correlation between two stationary series. The cross-correlation function (CCF) helps you determine which lags of time series X predicts the value of time series Y.\nThe set of sample correlations between xt+h and yt for h = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, and so on. A negative value for h is a correlation between the x-variable at a time before t and the y-variable at time t. For instance, consider h = −2. The CCF value would give the correlation between xt−2 and yt.\nWhen calculating correlations between lags of a variable and the variable itself (ACF) or another variable (CCF) you can’t, for example in a CCF, simply take corr(xt-k, yt) for the correlation of x at lag k and y and repeat for all the lags of x. Since the corr formula/function requires the mean of the series, you would be using a different mean for xk for each calculation of the correlation of each pair. The assumption is that the series are (second-order?) stationary and therefore have a constant mean (i.e. each series has 1 mean (and variance)), so the mean(s) of (each) original series should be used in the calculations of the correlations.\n\nSource: Modern Applied Statistics with S, Venables and Ripley\nCompared one against the other in COVID-19 CFR project and they actually produce similar patterns but different values of the CCF. The corr method produce inflated CCF values.\n\nWe expect about 1.75 false alarms out of the 35 sample cross-correlations even after prewhitening\nTerms\n\nIn a cross-correlation in which the direction of influence between two time-series is hypothesized or known,\n\nThe influential time-series is called the “input” time-series\nThe affected time-series is called the “output” time-series.\n\nWhen one or more xt+h , with h negative, are predictors of yt, it is sometimes said that x leads y.\nWhen one or more xt+h, with h positive, are predictors of yt, it is sometimes said that x lags y.\n\nAvoid spurious correlations\n\nMake sure there’s a theoretical reason for the two series to be related\n**Autocorrelation of at least one series should be removed (transformed to white noise)\n\nWith autocorrelation present:\n\nThe variance of cross-correlation coefficient is high and therefore spurious correlations are likely\nSignificance calculations are no longer valid since the CCF distribution will not be normal and the variance is no longer 1/n\n\n\nA problem even with stationary series (even more so with non-stationary series)\n\nSteps\n\nTest for stationarity\nFind number of differences to make the series stationary\n\nNot sure if each series should be differenced the same number of times\n\nWhy would you test a seasonal series and non-seasonal series for an association.\nThe requirement is stationarity, so maybe try using the highest difference needed between both series\n\nIn dynamic regression, Hyndman says difference all variables if one needs differencing, so proabably applicable here.\n\n\nSome examples also used log transformation , but when I did, it produced nonsensical CCF values. (covid cfr project). So, beware.\n\nSeasonal Difference –&gt; Difference\n(Optional) Lag scatter plots if the differenced series and look for patterns to get an idea of the strength of the linear correlation\n\nIf there’s a nonlinear pattern, might be difficult or might not to use a nonlinear or nonparametric correlation function. See 3rd bullet under CCF header above for discussion of stationarity assumption. May not be necessary with another correlation type.\n\nPrewhiten both series (cryer, chan method)\nApply correlation function\n\nPrewhitening\n\nIf either series contain autocorrelation, or the two series share common trends, it is difficult for the CCF to identify meaningful relationships between the two time series.

This will be most useful if what is a character string and the arguments are symbols or quoted expressions\n\nExample: Apply function to list of vectors\nvectors &lt;- list(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6), c(7, 8, 9))\ncombined_matrix &lt;- do.call(rbind, vectors)\n\ncombined_matrix\n##      [,1] [,2] [,3]\n## [1,]    1    2    3\n## [2,]    4    5    6\n## [3,]    7    8    9\nExample: Apply multiple functions\ndata_frames &lt;- list(\n  data.frame(a = 1:3), \n  data.frame(a = 4:6), \n  data.frame(a = 7:9)\n  )\nmean_results &lt;- do.call(\n  rbind, \n  lapply(data_frames, function(df) mean(df$a))\n  )\n\nmean_results\n##      [,1]\n## [1,]    2\n## [2,]    5\n## [3,]    8\n\nFirst the mean is calculated for column a of each df using lapply\n\nlapply is supplying the data for do.call in the required format, which is a list or character vector.\n\nSecond the results are combined into a matrix with rbind\n\n\nsink - used to divert R output to an external connection.\n\nUse Cases: exporting data to a file, logging R output, or debugging R code.\nArgs\n\nfile: The name of the file to which R output will be diverted. If file is NULL, then R output will be diverted to the console.\nappend: A logical value indicating whether R output should be appended to the file (TRUE) or overwritten (FALSE). The default value is FALSE.\ntype: A character string. Either the output stream or the messages stream. The name will be partially match so can be abbreviated.\nsplit: logical: if TRUE, output will be sent to the new sink and the current output stream, like the Unix program tee.\n\nExample: Logging output of code to file\nsink(\"r_output.log\")      # Redirect output to this file\n# Your R code goes here\nsink()                    # Turn off redirection\n\noutput file could also have an extension like “.txt”\n\nExample: Debugging\nsink(\"my_function.log\")   # Redirect output to this file\nmy_function()\nsink()                    # Turn off redirection\nExample: Appending output to a file\nsink(\"output.txt\", append = TRUE)  # Append output to the existing file\ncat(\"Additional text\\n\")  # Append custom text\nplain text\nsink()  # Turn off redirection\n\npmin and pmax\n\nFind the element-wise maximum and minimum values across vectors in R\nExample\nvec1 &lt;- c(3, 9, 2, 6)\nvec2 &lt;- c(7, 1, 8, 4)\npmax(vec1, vec2)\n#&gt; [1] 7 9 8 6\npmin(vec1, vec2)\n#&gt; [1] 3 1 2 4\nExample: With NAs\ndata1 &lt;- c(7, 3, NA, 12)\ndata2 &lt;- c(9, NA, 5, 8)\npmax(data1, data2, na.rm = TRUE)\n#&gt; [1] 9 3 5 12\n\nswitch\n\nExample:\nswitch(parallel,\n         windows = \"snow\" -&gt; para_proc,\n         other = \"multicore\" -&gt; para_proc,\n         no = \"no\" -&gt; para_proc,\n         stop(sprintf(\"%s is not one of the 3 possible parallel argument values.

(Gelman post)\nWeakly informative priors: they allow some implausibly strong relationships but generally bound the lines to possible ranges of the variables. (fig 5.3, pg 131)\nWe want our priors to be skeptical of large differences [in treatment effects], so that we reduce overfitting. Good priors hurt fit to sample but are expected to improve prediction. (pg 337)\nWe don’t formulate priors based on the sample data. We want the prior predictive distribution to live in the plausible outcome space, not fit the sample.\nFor logistic regression and poisson regression, a flat prior in the logit space is not a flat prior in the outcome probability space (pg 336)\nAs long as the priors are vague, minimizing the sum of squared deviations to the regression line is equivalent to finding the posterior mean. pg 200\n“As always in rescaling variables, the goals are to create focal points that you might have prior information about, prior to seeing the actual data values. That way we can assign priors that are not obviously crazy, and in thinking about those priors, we might realize that the model makes no sense. But this is only possible if we think about the relationship between measurements and parameters, and the exercise of rescaling and assigning sensible priors helps us along that path. Even when there are enough data that choice of priors is not crucial, this thought exercise is useful.” pg 258\nComparing the posteriors with the priors"

(I dunno about this, even if they’ve seen eda plots?)\n\nDon’t provide them with any estimates you may have from previous studies or other experts\nDon’t let them fixate on outlier scenarios they may have encountered\n\nRecord conversations with video and/or audio\n\nIf problems surface when evaluating the expert’s information, these can be useful to go back over the information collection process\n\nWas there a misunderstanding between you and the expert on what information you wanted\nWas the information biased? (see above)\nIf using mulitiple experts, maybe subgroups have different viewpoints/experiences which is causing a divergence in opinion (e.g nurses vs psychologists treating PTSD)\n\n\nIf problems surface when evaluating the expert’s information, it can be useful to gather specific experts that differ and have them discuss why they hold their substantially differing opinions. Afterwards, they may adjust their opinions and you’ll have a greater consensus.\nProcess\n\nElicit location parameter (e.g. via Trial Roulette) from the expert\n\nTrial Roulette (see paper in Misc for details)\n\nRequires the expert to have sufficient statistical knowledge to be able to place the blocks to form an appropriate distribution\nUser should be aware that distribution output may be inappropriate for sample data\n\nExample: Algorithm may output a Gamma distribution which is inappropriate for percentage data since the upper bound can be greater than one\n\nParameter space is split into subsections (e.g. quantiles)\nUser assigns blocks to each subsection\nExample From MATCH website which was an earlier implementation of {SHELF}\n\nTop chart is a histogram where each cell is a “block” (called “chips” at the bottom). The right panel shows the options for setting the axis ranges and number of bins\nBottom chart evidently estimates distribution parameters from the histogram in the top chart which are your prior’s parameters\n\n\nWith experts with less statistical training, it may be better for you to give them scenarios (e.g. combinations of quantiles of the predictor variables) and have them predict the outcome variable.\n\nCompute the statistics given their answers. Show them the results. Ask them to give an uncertainty range around that statistic.\nExample: From their predictions, you calculate the mean. Then you present them with this average and ask them about their uncertainty?\n\ni.e. What is the range around this value they expect the average to be in?\n\n\nAlso try combinations of methods\nSee paper in Misc for other options\n\nFeedback session\n\nExplain to the expert how you’re interpreting their information. Do they agree with your interpretation? Refine information based on their feedback.\n\nElicit scale and shape parameters (upper and lower bounds)\nFeedback session\nEvaluate distribution\n\n\nEvaluating Expert Distribution(s)\n\nMisc\n\nMight be better to use another measure instead of K-L divergence (see Inspect the distributions visually section below)\n\ne.g Jensen-Shannon Divergence, Population Stability Index (see Production, ML Monitoring for details)\n\n\nCalculate K-L divergence between the expert distribution and the computed posterior using the expert distribution as a prior\n\nSmaller K-L divergence means the 2 distributions are more similar\nLarger K-L divergence means the 2 distributions are more different\n\nCreate a benchmark distribution\n\nShould be a low information distribution as compared to the sample data distribution\ne.g. uniform distribution\n\nCalculate K-L divergence between the benchmark distribution and the computed posterior using the benchmark distribution as the prior\nCalculate ratio of K-L divergences (expert K-L/benchmark K-L)\n\nGreater than 1 is bad. Indicates a “prior data conflict” and it may be better to drop this expert’s distribution\nLess than 1 is good. Potentially an informative prior\n\nInspect the distributions visually (Expert prior distributions and computed posterior from benchmark prior)\n\nK-L divergence penalyzes more certain distributions (i.e. skinny, tall) than less certain distribtutions (fatter, shorter) even if they have the same mean/median and mostly the same information\n\nSo, an expert that is more certain may have a disqualifying ratio of K-L difference while a less certain expert with a very similar distribution has a qualifying ratio.\n\nAfter inspecting the distributions, you may determine that distributions really are too different and the expert is far too certain to keep.\n\n\n\n\nAggregate distributions if you’re eliciting from multiple experts\n\nAverage the distributions (i.e. equal weights for all experts)\nRank experts (e.g. by K-L ratio), weight them, then calculate a weighted average distribution\nUse aggregated distribution(s) as your prior(s)"

The accuracy for 5% and 95% quantiles would be between one and two significant digits.\nWith 10,000 draws, the uncertainty is 1% of the posterior scale which would often be sufficient for two significant digit accuracy.\n\nFor 1 significant digit accuracy, 100 independent draws would be often sufficient, but reliable convergence diagnostics may need more iterations than 100.\nFor posterior quantiles, more draws may be needed (need more draws to get values towards the tails of the posterior)\n\nSome quantities of interest may have posterior distribution with infinite variance, and then the ESS and MCSE are not defined for the expectation.\n\nIn such cases, use median instead of mean and mean absolute deviation (MAD) instead of standard deviation.\nVariance of parameter posteriors\nas_draws_rvars(brms_fit) %&gt;%\n    summarise_draws(var = distributional::variance) \n#&gt;    variable  var\n#&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt;  1 mu        11.6\n#&gt;  2 tau      12.8\n#&gt;  3 theta[1]  39.7\n#&gt;  4 theta[2]  21.5\n\n\nSteps\n\nCheck convergence diagnostics for all parameters\n\ne.g. RHat, ESS, autocorrelation plots (see Diagnostics, Bayes)\n\nLook at the posterior for quantities of interest and decide how many significant digits is reasonable taking into account the posterior uncertainty (using SD, MAD, or tail quantiles)\n\nYou want to be able to distinguish you upper or lower CI from the point estimate\n\ne.g. Point estimate is 2.1 and you upper CI is 2.1 then you want at least another significant digit.\n\n\nCheck that MCSE is small enough for the desired accuracy of reporting the posterior summaries for the quantities of interest.\n\nCalculate the range of variation due to MC sampling for your paramter (See MCSE example)\n\nMC sampling error is the average amount of variation that’s expected from changing seeds and re-running the analysis\n\nIf the accuracy is not sufficient (i.e. range is too wide), report less digits or run more iterations.\n\n\nMonte Carlo standard error (MCSE) - uncertainty about a parameter estimate due to MCMC sampling error\n\nPackages\n\n{posterior} is the preferred package for brms objects\n{mcmcse} - methods to calculate MCMC standard errors for means and quantiles using sub-sampling methods.

(i.e. okay to report the estimate as 2)\n\nThis is because\n\n1.966 + 0.02 = 1.986 which would still be rounded up to 2\n1.966 - 0.02 = 1.946 which would still be rounded up to 2\n\n\n\nDraws and iterations\n\nWith an MCSE in the 100ths (e.g. 0.07), 4 times more iterations would halve the MCSEs\nWith an MCSE in the 1000ths (e.g. 0.007), 64 times more iterations would halve the MCSEs\nMCSEs depend on the quantity type. Continuous quantities (e.g. parameter estimates) have more information than discrete quantities (e.g. indicator values used to calculate probabilities).\n\nFor example, above, the estimate for whether the temperature increase is larger than 4 degrees per century has high ESS, but the indicator variable contains less information (than continuous values) and thus much higher ESS would be needed for two significant digit accuracy."

Notes for marketing and financial graphs taken from articles and vignettes introducing that package.\ntl;dr - Most useful/popular are the Cumulative Gains and Cumulative Response graphs. \nNote: the example objective is to select the customers of a bank that are most likely to respond to an offer to purchase a “term deposit”. The outcome is binary: “term deposit” or “no”\nInformation from models used in these plots\n\nPredicted probability for the target class\n(x-axis) Equally sized groups (ntiles - mash-up of “n” and “percentile”) based on this predicted probability (e.g. splitting observations into deciles. Top 10% in predicted probability for target class would be in the first decile.)\nActual number of observed target class observations in these groups\n\nThe test dataset is used for the plots to get a realistic idea of what a marketing campaign in the wild would produce.\n\nResponse Plot has some GOF capability so I could maybe see using the validation set with that plot to compare models with.\n\nCumulative Gains (aka gains plot)\n\nAnswers the question: “When we apply the model and select the best X ntiles, what % of the actual target class observations can we expect to target?”\n\ny-axis = % of positive events (1s in binary classification) out of the entire dataset\n\nHow to apply:\n\nChoose a probability threshold (i.e. the corresponding ntile on the x-axis). The graph shows the percentage of observations on the y-axis that are within that threshold\nChoose the percentage of customers that you can afford to target with your campaign. The corresponding ntile on the x-axis shows the ntile and therefore the associated probability of positive result.\n\n“When we select 20% with the highest probability according to gradient boosted trees, this selection holds 87% of all term deposit cases in test data.”\n\nsays using the top 20% will include 87% of all the 1s (in binary classification) in the entire dataset.\n\n\nIf the gains is 87%, then there are potentially 13% of the total 1s that won’t be included in the campaign if we only target the top 20% percent.\n\n\nwizard model (perfect model) line - line takes steepest route to 100% on y-axis as possible, depending on the percentage of your outcome variable is the target level.\n\nFor the graph above, it looks like around 12% of the outcome variable values are the positive event case since the line reaches the 100% on the y-axis a little past the 1st decile. So the perfect model predicts all those values as being the positive class.\n\n\nCumulative Lift (aka index or lift plot)\n\nEspecially useful for companies with little to no experience with data models\nAnswers the question: “When we apply the model and select the best X ntiles, how many times better is that than using no model at all?”\n“no model at all” (i.e. coin flip) is a random model (also seen in the gains plot) is represented by a horizontal line at y = 1 or 100% depending on how the y-axis is specified. It is the ratio of the % of actual target category observations in each ntile to the overall % of actual target category observations after randomization of the rows of the data set.\nThe amount of lift can’t be generalized to all models and all data sets. So there aren’t guidelines as to what is a “good” lift score and what isn’t. If 50% of your data belongs to the target (positive) class of interest, a perfect model would ‘only’ do twice as good (lift: 2) as a random selection. If 10% of the data belong to the positive class, then lift = 10 or 1000% is the best possible lift score.\nHow to apply:\n\nChoose a ntile (x-axis) and the corresponding y value can be used to explain to stakeholders how many times or what percent better this model is at selecting the top prospects than random selection.\n\n“A term deposit campaign targeted at a selection of 20% of all customers based on our gradient boosted trees model can be expected to have a 4 times higher response (434%) compared to a random sample of customers.”\n\n\n  \n\nResponse Plot\n\nplots the percentage of *target class* observations per ntile\n\nnote: the cumulative gains y-axis is total observations where this plot’s y-axis is just positive class (1s in a binary classification model)\n\nAnswers the question: “When we apply the model and select ntile X, what is the expected % of target class observations in that ntile?” but also gives information about the model fit.\nHow to apply:\n\nThis plot is more important in what it tells about the model fit than what it says about how many observations are in a particular ntile\n\nA good fitting model will have a sharp sloping line with the highest response % in the lower ntiles. This says that the model is giving high probability scores to the vast majority of the positive class observations\nFor model comparison: the earlier the line crosses the horizontal (random model) line should indicate a steeper slope and therefore a better fit.\n\n“When we select decile 1 (10th percentile) according to model gradient boosted trees in dataset test data the % of term deposit cases in the selection is 51%.”\nThe horizontal line represents a random model (i.e. the % of target class cases in the total set)\n\nFrom the ntile where the line intersects the horizontal dashed-line and onwards, the % of target class cases is lower than a random selection of cases would hold.\n\n\n\n\nCumulative Response\n\nAnswers the question: “When we apply the model and select up until ntile X, what is the expected % of target class observations in the selection?\n\nOften used to decide - together with business colleagues - up until what decile to select for a marketing campaign\n\nHow to apply:\n\n“When we select ntiles 1 until 30 according to model gradient boosted trees in dataset test data, the % of term deposit cases in the selection is 36%.”\n\nIn other words, targeting these customers should produce a response rate (percent of customers purchasing a term deposit) of 35% on average as compared to randomly selecting the same number of customers which is 12% (term deposits/total obs for the test set).\nThe y-axis is the percentage of 1s (in binary classification) in that subset (ntiles from 1 to 30). Different from cumulative gains where the y-axis is the percentage of 1s in the entire dataset.\n\nIs that response big enough to have a successfull campaign, given costs and other expectations? Will the absolute number of sold term deposits meet the targets? Or do we lose too much of all potential term deposit buyers by only selecting the top 30%? To answer that question, we can go back to the cumulative gains plot.\nThe dashed horizontal is the same as in the Response Plot\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Plots\n\n{modelplotr} PKG has some nice implementations. Notes for marketing and financial graphs taken from articles and vignettes introducing that package.\nNote: the example objective is to select the customers of a bank that are most likely to respond to an offer to purchase a “term deposit”. The outcome is binary: “term deposit” or “no”\n\nfixed costs = $75,000 (a tv commercial and some glossy print material)\nvariable costs per unit = $50 (customers are given an incentive to buy)\nprofit per unit = $250\n\nInformation from models used in these plots\n\n(also in marketing plots) Predicted probability for the target class\n(also in marketing plots) (x-axis) Equally sized groups (ntiles - mash-up of “n” and “percentile”) based on this predicted probability (e.g. splitting observations into deciles. Top 10% in predicted probability for target class would be in the first decile.)\n(also in marketing plots) Actual number of observed target class observations in these groups\nfixed costs (e.g. sales force expenses, advertising campaigns, sales promotion, and distribution costs)\nvariable costs per unit (e.g. sales commission, bonuses, and performance allowances)\nprofit per sale \n\nThe test dataset is used for the plots to get a realistic idea of what a marketing campaign in the wild would cost and return. A validation set could be used on the Revenue and Costs Plot and models could be compared based risk of nonprofitability.\nProfit Plot\n\nAnswers the question: “When we apply the model and select up until ntile X, what is the expected profit of the campaign?”\nHow to apply:\n\nPretty self-explanatory. The most profitable ntile is the one directly under the apex of the curve.\nThe most profitable ntile is highlighted by default, but this can be specified if so desired\nannotation means?\n\n\n\nCosts and Revenues Plot\n\nAnswers the question: “When we apply the model and select up until decile X, what are the expected revenues and investments of the campaign?”\nThe costs are the cumulative costs of selecting up until a given decile and consist of both fixed costs and variable costs.\nThe revenues take into account the expected response % - as plotted in the cumulative response plot - as well as the expected revenue per response.\nSolid curve is the revenue and the dashed diagonal line is the total costs\nHow to apply:\n\nThe campaign is profitable in the plot area where revenues exceed costs.\nGives an idea of the range of spending that can be considered while the campaign remains profitable. Ranges could be associated with risk. The smaller the range, the greater the risk given the uncertainty of the models. Various campaign ranges could be compared based on this risk.\nSee profits plot for optimal ntile.\n\n\n\nROI Plot\n\nAnswers the question: “When we apply the model and select up until decile X, what is the expected % return on investment of the campaign?”\nThe ntile at which the campaign profit is maximized is not necessarily the same as the ntile where the campaign ROI is maximized\n\nIt can be the case that a bigger selection (higher decile) results in a higher profit, however this selection needs a larger investment (cost), impacting the ROI negatively.\nSo maximum ROI can be considered the most effficient use of resources, but it takes money to make (the most) money.\n\nBasic formula for ROI = Net Profit / Total Investment * 100\nHow to apply:\n\nThe ntile directly underneath the apex of the curve is where the ROI is maximized."

Uses Super Learner ensembling and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) which they call Targeted Learning.\n\nIgnorability - By randomly assigning treatment, researchers can ensure that the potential outcomes are independent of treatment assignment, so that the average difference in outcomes between the two groups can only be attributable to treatment\n\nEngineering outcome variables using potential adjustment variables does not automatically adjust for those variables in your model\n\nNotes from There Are No Magic Outcome Variables\nExample\n\n\nP is population density\nX is the variable of interest\nGDP and P have been used to create GDP/P\nP influences X and provides a backdoor path to GDP/P, so P must be adjusted for\nEven if P doesn’t influence X, the point is that constructing GDP/P using P doens’t automatically adjust for P\n\n\nRandomized experiments remove all paths from the treatment variable, X\n\n\nAdjusting for Z, B, and C can add precision to measurement of the treatment effect since they are causal to Y, but they aren’t necessary to get an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect.\n\nTable 2 fallacy (Notes from McElreath video, 2022 SR Lecture 6)\n\n\nThe 2nd table presented in a paper is usually a summary of all the effects of a regression. The fallacy is that the coefficient of each variable is treated as causal.\nExample: The effect of HIV on Stroke\n\nThe model is lm(Stroke ~ HIV + Smoke + Age)\n\nOnly the coefficient of the HIV variable should be treated as causal and none of the other adjustment variables (Smoke, Age)\n\nThe effects for Smoke and Age are only partial.\nThere are likely unobserved confounding variables, U, on the effect of Smoking on Stroke (e.g. other lifestyle variables).\n\nSmoke is confounded so it’s causal estimate is biased\nAge is also confounded since Smoke is now a collider and has been conditioned upon. This opens the non-causal path, Age-Smoke-U-Stroke.\n\nAge-Smoke is frontdoor, but the backdoor path, Smoke-U, also becomes a backdoor path for Age once Smoke is conditioned upon. (aka sub-backdoor path)\nSo any open path that contains a backdoor path must also be closed\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\nDon’t include effect estimates of adjustment variables\nExplicitly interpret each effect estimate according to the causal model\n\nSee 2022 SR at the end of Lecture 6 where McElreath breaks down the interpretation of each adjustment variable estimated effect.\n\n\n\nPartial Identification (Handling Unobserved Confounds)\n\nSometimes the confounding paths of a DAG model can be not be resolved.\n\nFor confounders that influence the treatment and outcome, see:\n\nStructural Causal Models &gt;&gt; Bayesian examples\nIf there’s a mediator, see Other Articles &gt;&gt; Frontdoor Adjustment\n\nMeasure proxies for the unobserved confound if it’s not practical/ethical to measure\n\ni.e. If the confound is ability, then test scores, letters of recommendation, etc. could be proxies.\n\nExample: 2022 SR Lecture 10 video, code\n\n\nA: Admitted to Grad School, G: Gender, D: Dept, u: Ability, T1,2,3: 3 Test Scores\n\nAbility is latent variable/unobserved confounder\nTest Scores are proxies for Ability\n\nBoth models are fit simultaneously\nCouldn’t find a way to use {brms} to code this and Kurz didn’t included it in his brms SR book.\n\n\n\nA biased estimate is better than no estimate. It can provide an upper bound\nFind a natural experiment or design one\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nAfter the analyis, you should be able to make the statement, “In order for the confound to be responsible for the entire causal effect, it was have to be .”\n\n\nPackages\n\n{tipr} - tools for tipping point sensitivity analyses\n\nSteps for using sensitivity analysis\n\nPerform a sensitivity analysis to determine plausibly how much of the causal effect is due to confounding paths\n\nAssume the confound exists, model it’s consequences for different strengths/kinds of influence\nExample: 2022 SR Lecture 10 video, code \n\nA: Admitted to Grad School, G: Gender, D: Dept, u: Unobserved Confounder\nBoth models are fit simultaneously\nValues for β and γ are specified and u is estimated as a parameter\nI think Gender (G) is an interaction in both models which I didn’t think was possible given there are no arrows of influence from gender to u.\n\nSince gender is a moderator it wouldn’t necessarily have to be an influence arrow, it would only need to be an arrow from G to the effect of u on D (see Moderator Analysis), so maybe this is kosher\nCould also be that I’m misunderstanding McElreath’s code he uses to specify his models with {Rethinking}.\n\nCouldn’t find a way to use {brms} to code this and Kurz didn’t included it in his brms SR book.\n\n\nUse previous studies that have effect strengths of those potential confounding variables\nCompare the strengths from the previous studies to the strength determined from the sensitivity analysis. The difference is a good guess for the strength of the causal effect of your treatment variable."

Otherwise, we might induce spurious associations (e.g. confounding such as collider bias).\nOverview\n\nMake a causal model (i.e. DAG)\n\nNeed background information in order to make the causal assumptions represented in the DAG\nDAGs only show whether or not a variable influences another, not how the influence occurs (e.g. DAGs can’t show interactions between variables or whether the association is non-linear)\n\nUse it to design data collection and statistical procedures\n\nSteps:\n\nDetermine two variables of interest (exposure, outcome) that you want to determine if a causal relationship exists and what effect the exposure has.\nUse domain knowledge or prior scholarship to determine the relevant variable and the likely associations between all variables in data\nCreate the DAG\n\nIdentify the direct causal path between exposure and outcome\nIdentify other explanatory variables and label their directions of influence with each other, the exposure, and the outcome variable\nConsider which variables (especially the exposure and the outcome) have unobserved variables influencing them.\n\nAnalyze the DAG\n\nIdentify colliders and use d-separation to determine conditional independencies\nIdentify additional paths (backdoor paths, sub-backdoor paths) between exposure and outcome\nUse the backdoor criterion to determine the set of variables that need to be adjusted for in order to block all backdoor paths with only the direct causal path remaining open.\nAdd additional adjustment variables that are causal to the outcome variable (but don’t confound the treatment effect) in order to add precision to the estimate of the treatment effect\n\nCreate simulated data that fits the DAG (i.e. a generative model)\nPerform statistical analysis (i.e. SCMs) on the simulated data  to make sure you can measure the causal effect.\nDesign experiment and collect the data\nRun the statistical analysis on the collected data and calculate the average causal effect (ACE) under the assumptions that your DAG and model specifications are correct.\nBased on your results, revise the DAG and SCM as necessary and repeat as necessary\n\nBad Adjustment Variables (Code and more details included in 2022 SR, Lecture 6)\n\nFor all examples, Z is the adjustment variable that’s being considered; X is the treatment and Y is the outcome\n\nIn each scenario, including Z produces a biased estimate of X, so the correct model is Y ~ X.\n\nM-bias\n\n\nZ doesn’t have a direct causal influence on the either X or Y, but when it’s conditioned upon it becomes a collider due to unobserved confounds that have a direct causal influence on X and Y.\nCommon issue in Political Science and network analysis\nExample\n\nY: Health of Person 2\nX: Health of Person 1\nZ: Friendship status\n\nPre-treatment variable (tend to be open to collider paths) since they could be friends before the exposure\n\nU: Hobbies of Person 1\nV: Hobbies of Person 2\n\n\nPost-Treatment Bias\n\n\nZ is a mediator and conditioning upon Z blocks the path from X to Y, but opens the backdoor path through the unobserved confound, U.\nCommon in medical studies  \nExample\n\nY: Lifespan\nX: Win Lottery\nZ: Happiness\nU: Contextual Confounds\n\n\nSelection Bias\n\n\nSame as collider bias\n\nThis version adds an unobserved confounder\n\nExample\n\nY: Income\nX: Education\nZ: Values\nU: Family\n\n\nCase-Control Bias\n\n\nZ is a descendent. Since Z has information about Y, conditioning on it will narrow the variation of Y and distort the measured effect of X.\nAlso see Association &gt;&gt; Single Path DAGs &gt;&gt; Descendent\nExample\n\nY: Occupation\nX: Education\nZ: Income\n\n\nPrecision Parasite\n\n\n2 versions: with and without U\n\nWithout U, conditioning on Z removes variation from X and lessens (but doesn’t bias) the precision of the estimated effect of X on Y (i.e. inflated std.error)\nWith U, the effect of X is biased and that bias is amplified when Z is included.\n\n\nPeer Bias\n\n\nClassic DAG of the Berkley Admission-Race-Department study\nAlso see Structural Causal Models &gt;&gt; Example (Bayesian Peer Bias)\nX is race, E is department, Q is unobserved (e.g. student quality), Y is Admission\nDepartment cannot be conditioned upon because it’s a collider with Q and would bias the estimate of X through a sub-backdoor path, X-E-Q-Y\nOnly the total effect of X on Y can be estimated (Y ~ X) since E cannot be conditioned upon but that’s not interesting and maybe not precise"

(see Simpson’s Paradox example)\n\nBackdoor Path - A non-causal path that enters a causal variable in a DAG rather than exits it.\n\ne.g. the path that connects a collider to a causal variable points from the collider to the causal variable\nSub-backdoor Path - this path begins with a frontdoor path but through conditioning on a variable, it opens a connecting backdoor path which biases the treatment effect\n\nsee Misc &gt;&gt; Table 1 Fallacy and Causal Design &gt;&gt; Bad Adjustment Variables &gt;&gt; Peer Bias\n\n\nThe causal effect is the distribution of Y when we change x, averaged over the distributions of the adjustment variables (Z)\nCausal Hierarchy (lowest to highest)\n\nAssociation\n\nassociated action: Seeing - observational; observing the value of Y when X = x\n\n , observational distribution; What values Y would likely take on if X happened to equal x.\n\n\nIntervention\n\nassociated action (do-Calculus): Doing -  experimental; observing the value of Y after setting X = x\n\n , interventional distribution; What values Y would likely take on if X would be set to x.\nUsing the do operator allows us to make inferences about the population but not individuals.\ndo(X) means to cut all of the backdoor paths into X, as if we did a manipulative experiment. The do-operator changes the graph, closing the backdoors.\nThe do-operator defines a causal relationship, because Pr(Y|do(X)) tells us the expected result of manipulating X on Y, given a causal graph.\n\nWe might say that some variable X is a cause of Y when Pr(Y|do(X)) &gt; Pr(Y|do(not-X)).\n\n(makes more sense to me with a binary outcome, Pr(Y = 1|do(X), but maybe Y as a continuous variable can be defined a subset. …I dunno)\n\n\nThe ordinary conditional probability comparison, Pr(Y|X) &gt; Pr(Y|not-X), is not the same. It does not close the backdoor.\nNote that what the do-operator gives you is not just the direct causal effect. It is the total causal effect through all forward paths.\n\nTo get a direct causal effect, you might have to close more backdoors.\n\nThe do-operator can also be used to derive causal inference strategies even when some backdoors cannot be closed.\n\n\nCounterfactual\n\nassociated action: Imagining - what would be the outcome if the alternative would’ve happened.\nIndividual Causal Effects can be calculated but it requires stronger assumptions and deeper understanding of the causal mechanisms\n\nNeed to research this part further.\nIf the underlying SCM is linear then the ICE = ACE.\n\n\n\nA collider along a path blocks that path. However, conditioning on a collider (or any of its descendants) unblocks that path\n\nWhen a collider is conditioned upon, the change in the association between the two nodes it separates is called collider bias.\n\ne.g. if Z is a collider between X and Y, conditioning upon Z will induce an association between X and Y.\n\n\nA conditioning set, \\(L\\), is the set of nodes we condition on (it can be empty).\nConfounding is the situation where a (possibly unobserved) common cause obscures the causal relationship between two or more variables.\n\nThere is more than one causal path between two nodes.\nA causal effect of X on Y is confounded if  \nCollider bias is a type of confounding. When a collider is controlled for, a second (or more) path opens, and the effect is confounded\n\nX and Y are d-separated by [L if conditioning on all members in [L blocks all paths between the nodes, X and Y.\n\nTool for checking the conditional independencies which are visualized in DAGs.\n\nA descendant is a node connected to a parent node by that parent node’s outgoing arrow.\nFrontdoor Adjustment - In a causal chain with three nodes X→Z→Y, we can estimate the effect of X on Y indirectly by combining two distinct quantities: (Useful for when unobserved confounders prevent direct causal estimation)\n\nThe estimate of the effect of X on Z, P(Z|do(X))\nThe estimate of the effect of Z on Y, P(Y|do(Z), X)\n\nFrontdoor Path - a path that exits a causal variable in a DAG rather than enters it.\n\ne.g. the path that connects a causal variable, X, to an outcome variable, Y, has an arrow that points from X to Y.\n\nMarkov Equivalence - A set of DAGs, each with the same conditional independencies\nMediation Analysis - seeks to identify and explain the mechanism or process that underlies an observed relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable via the inclusion of a third hypothetical variable, known as a mediator variable (z-variable in the DAGs of “pipes” below)\n\nIncluding a mediator and the independent variable in a regression will result in the independent variable not being signficant and the mediator being significant.\n\nModeration Analysis - Like mediation analysis, it allows you to test for the influence of a third variable, Z, on the relationship between variables X and Y, but rather than testing a causal link between these other variables, moderation tests for when or under what conditions an effect occurs.\nA node is a parent of another node if it has an outgoing arrow to that node\nA path from X to Y is a sequence of nodes and edges such that the start and end nodes are X and Y, respectively.\nResidual Confounding occurs when a confounding variable is measured imperfectly or with some error and the adjustment using this imperfect measure does not completely remove the effect of the confounding variable.\n\nExample: Women who smoke during pregnancy have a decreased risk of having a Down syndrome birth.\n\nThis is puzzling, as smoking is not often thought of as a good thing to do. Should we ask women to start smoking during pregnancy?\nIt turns out that there is a relationship between age and smoking during pregnancy, with younger women being more likely to indulge in this bad habit. Younger women are also less likely to give birth to a child with Down syndrome. When you adjust the model relating smoking and Down syndrome for the important covariate of age, then the effect of smoking disappears. But when you make the adjustment using a binary variable (age&lt;35 years, age &gt;=35 years), the protective effect of smoking appears to remain.\n\n\nStructural Causal Models (SCMs) - relate causal and probabilistic statements; each equation is a causal statement\n\n\n\n“:=” is the assignment operator\nX is a direct cause of Y which it influences through the function f( )\n\nwhere f is a statistical model\n\nThe noise variables, ϵX and ϵY, are assumed to be independent.\n\nThere are Stochastic and Deterministic SCMs. Deterministic SCMs presented in article."

The most likely effect is a moderately positive one but it could also be negative.\nAdding more simulated data to this example will move the point estimate towards zero\n\n\n\nExample (Bayesian Peer Bias)\n\nAlso see Causal Design &gt;&gt; Bad Adjustment Variables &gt;&gt; Peer Bias\nHypothesis: racial discrimination in acceptance of applicatioon to Berkeley grad schools\n\nTruth: moderate negative effect, -0.8\n\nVariables:\n\nX is race, E is department, Q is an unobserved confound (latent variable: student quality), Y is binary; Admission/No Admission\nR1 and R2 are proxy variables for Q (e.g. test scores, lab work, extracurriculars, etc.)\n\nAssumptions: System is linear\nDAG and Code\n\n\nXX is the race variable with X as the coefficient in the code\n\nThis code uses his {rethinking} package so some of this syntax is unfamiliar\n\nR1 and R2 are shown in the DAG to be influenced by student quality, Q\nEvery prior is normal except for Q’s coefficient\n\nResults\n\n\nTruth: -0.8\n1st 3 glm models shows how the unobserved confound, Q, biases the estimate when using a typical logistic regression model to estimate the causal effect\nBayesian model isn’t fooled because Q is specified as an input to the function for Y\n\nInterpretation: There is a reliably negative effect (no 0 in the CI).

You’ll just have to calculate the effects by hand unless some outside package (e.g. sjstats) takes a brms model and does it for you.\n\nSee below for formulas. {mediation} papers should have other formulas for other types of models (e.g. poisson, binomial)\n\n{mediation} handles a lot for you. Method isn’t bayesian but is very similar to it in a frequentist-bootstrappy-simulation way.\n\nPackage has been substantially updated since that article was written.\n\n\nAlso see\n\nOther Articles &gt;&gt; Frontdoor Adjustment\nStatistical Rethinking &gt;&gt; Chapter 11 &gt;&gt; Conclusion of Berkeley Admissions example\n\nalso Lecture 9 2022 video\n\nebook (w/brms) Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis\n\nIncluding a mediator and the independent variable in a regression will result in the independent variable not being signficant and the mediator being significant.\n\nExample: Causal effect of education on income\n\nSay occupation is your mediator. Education has a big impact on your occupation, which in turn has a big impact on your income. You don’t want to control for a mediator if you are interested in the full effect of X on Y! Because a huge part of how X impacts on Y is precisely through the mediation of C, in our case choice of and access to occupation, given a certain level of education. If you ‘control’ for occupation you will be greatly underestimating the importance of education.\n\n\nWhen would you want to only measure the Direct Effect?\n\nExample: Determining the amount of remuneration for discrimination\n\nFrom Simulating confounders, colliders and mediators\nVariables\n\nOutcome: Pay Gap\nTreatment: Gender\n\nIn this case, this variable is actually “gender discrimination in the current workplace in making a pay decision” (for which we use actual, observed Gender as a proxy)\n\nMediators: Occupation and Experience\n\nWhen determining whether a type of descrimination exists, you don’t want to condtion on the mediators, because the effect of gender will be underestimated. So, you’d want the total effect. But here, discrimation is already determined and Gender is now a proxy variable. Under Gender’s new definition, Occupation and Experience might influence the amount of “gender discrimiation,” so they can’t be definitively labelled mediators any more.\nSo if you want to estimate that final “equal pay for equal work” step of the chain then yes it is legitimate to control for occupation and experience.\n\n\nShould always compare a mediation model to a model without mediation\n\nAn unnecessary mediation model will almost certainly be weaker and probably more confusing than the model you would otherwise have.\n\nAverage Causal Mediation Effect (ACME) (aka Indirect Effect)- the expected difference in the potential outcome when the mediator took the value that it would have under the treatment condition as opposed to the control condition, while the treatment status itself is held constant.\n\nIf this isn’t significant, there isn’t a mediation effect\nIt is possible that the ACME takes different values depending on the baseline treatment status. Shown by analyzing the interaction between the treatment variable and the mediator\nδ(t) = E[Y (t, M(t1)) − Y (t, M(t0))]\n\nwhere\n\nt, t1, t0 are particular values of the treatment T such that t1 ≠ t0,\nM(t) is the potential mediator\nY (t, m) is the potential outcome variable\n\n\n\nAverage Direct Effect (ADE) - the expected difference in the potential outcome when the treatment is changed but the mediator is held constant at the value that it would have if the treatment equals t.\n\nζ(t) = E[Y (t1, M(t)) − Y (t0, M(t))]\n\nThe Total Effect of the treatment on the outcome is ACME + ADE.\n\nConditions where you likely do NOT need mediation analysis :\n\nIf you cannot think of your model in temporal or physical terms, such that X necessarily leads to the mediator, which then necessarily leads to the outcome.\nIf you could see the arrows going either direction.\nIf when describing your model, everyone thinks you’re talking about an interaction (a.k.a. moderation).\nIf there is NO strong correlation between key variables (variables of interest) and mediator, and if there is NO strong correlation between mediator and the outcome.\n\nSobel test - tests whether the suspected mediator’s influence on the independent variable is significant.\n\nPerforming the test in R via bda::mediation.test - article\n\nMethods\n\nBaron & Kenny’s (1986) 4-step indirect effect method has low power\nProduct-of-Paths (or difference in coefficients)\n\nc - c’ = a*b (see figure at start of this section) where c - c’ is the indirect effect (aka ACME)\n\nif either a or b are nearly zero, then the indirect effect can only be nearly zero\nFormula only appropriate for the analysis of causal mediation effects when both the mediator and outcome models are linear regressions where treatment (IV) and moderator enter the models additively (e.g. without interaction)\n\nEffect formulas for models with an interaction between treatment and moderator (Paper)\n\nmediator: M = α2 + β2Ti + ξT2Xi + εi2(T~i`)\noutcome: Y = α~3 + β3Ti + γMi + κTiMi + ξT3Xi + εi3(Ti, Mi)\nACME = β2(γ + κt) where t = 0,1\nADE = β3 + κ{α2 + β2t + ξT2Ε(Xi)}\nATE = β2γ + β3 +κ{α2 + β2 + ξT2Ε(Xi)}\n\nAlternatively, fit Y = α1 + β1Ti + ξT1Xi + ηTTiXi + εi1\n\nThen ATE = β1 + ηTE(Xi)\n\n\nNotes\n\nVariables\n\nT is treatment, M is mediator, X is a set of adjustment variables\n\nThe exponentiated T in ξT is to let you know it can be a set of coefficients for a set of adjustment variables (I guess)\n\n\nCouldn’t figure out why curly braces are being used\nACME with have two estimates (t=0, t=1)\nATE (average total effect)\nΕ(Xi) is the sample average of each adjustment variable and it’s multiplied by its associated ξ2 coefficient\nSee paper for other types of models\n\n\n{lavaan}, {brms}\n\nTingley, Yamamoto, Hirose, Keele, & Imai, 2014\n\nQuasi-bayesian approach (paper ,esp Appendix D, for details)\n\nFits the mediation and outcome models (see 1st example)\nTakes the coefficients and vcov matrices from both models\n\nUses the coefs (means) and vcovs (variances) as inputs to a mvnorm function to simulate distributions for the coefficients.\nI do not understand what these are used for… would have to look at the code.\n\nSamples predictions of each model K times for treatment = 1, then for treatment = 0\nCalcs difference between predictions for each set of samples, then averages to get the ACME\n\nAssumes Sequential Ignorability\n\nRequires treatment randomization or an equivalent assignment mechanism\nmediator is also ignorable given the observed treatment and pre-treatment confounders. This additional assumption is quite strong because it excludes the existence of (measured or unmeasured) post-treatment confounders as well as that of unmeasured pretreatment confounders. This assumption, therefore, rules out the possibility of multiple mediators that are causally related to each other (see Section 6 for the method that is designed to deal with such a scenario).\nCan’t be tested but a sensitivity analysis can be conducted using mediation::medsens (see vignette)\n\n{mediation} (vignette)\n\nMultiple types of models for both mediator and outcome\n\nincluding multilevel model functions from {lme4} supported\n\nMethods for:\n\n‘moderated’ mediation\n\nthe magnitude of the ACME depends on (or is moderated by) a pre-treatment covariate. Such a pre-treatment covariate is called a moderator. (see Moderator Analysis)\nACME can depend on treatment status (i.e. interaction between treatment and mediator), but this situation is talking about a separate variable moderating the effect of the treatment on the mediator.\n\nmultiple mediators (which violates sequential ingnorability but can be handled)\nvarious experimental designs (e.g. parallel, crossover)\ntreatment non-compliance\n\nUses MASS (so may have conflicts with dplyr)\nNo latent variable capabilities\n\n\nEtsy article calculates generalized average causal mediation effect (GACME) and generalized average direct effect (GADE) and uses a known mediator to measure the direct causal effect even when the DAG has multiple unknown mediators (paper, video, R code linked in article)\n\nExample: Tingley, 2014 Method\n\nEquations\n\n\n\nPredictions for “job_seek” in the mediator model (top) are used as predictor values in the outcome model (bottom).\n\nData: data(jobs, package = 'mediation')\n\ndepress2: outcome, numeric: Measure of depressive symptoms post-treatment.

    "text": "Moderation Analysis\n\n\nMisc\n\nAlso see Introduction to Mediation, Moderation, and Conditional Process Analysis\n\nLike mediation analysis, it allows you to test for the influence of a third variable, Z (moderator), on the relationship between variables X and Y, but rather than testing a causal link between these other variables, moderation tests for when or under what conditions an effect occurs.\n\nModerators are conceptually different from mediators (“when” (moderator) vs “how/why” (mediator)).\n\nThere can be moderated mediation effect though. (see Mediation Analysis &gt;&gt; Methods &gt;&gt; {mediation})\n\nModerators can stengthen, weaken, or reverse the nature of a relationship.\nSome variables may be a moderator or a mediator depending on your question.\n\nAssumption: assumes that there is little to no measurement error in the moderator variable and that the DV did not CAUSE the moderator.\n\nIf moderator error is likely to be high, researchers should collect multiple indicators of the construct and use SEM to estimate latent variables.\nThe safest ways to make sure your moderator is not caused by your DV are to experimentally manipulate the variable or collect the measurement of your moderator before you introduce your IV.\n\nModeration can be tested by interacting variables of interest (moderator x IV) and plotting the simple slopes of the interaction, if present.\n\nSee Regression, Interactions for simple slopes/effects analysis\nMean center both your moderator and your IV to reduce multicolinearity and make interpretation easier. (“c” in variable names indicates variable was centered)\n\nExample: academic self-efficacy (moderator)(confidence in own’s ability to do well in school) moderates the relationship between task importance (independent variable (IV)) and the amount of test anxiety (outcome) a student feels (Nie, Lau, & Liau, 2011).\n\nStudents with high self-efficacy experience less anxiety on important tests (task importance) than students with low self-efficacy while all students feel relatively low anxiety for less important tests.\nSelf-efficacy (Z) is considered a moderator in this case because it interacts with task importance (X), creating a different effect on test anxiety (Y) at different levels of task importance.\n\nExample: What is the relationship between the number of hours of sleep (X, independent variable (IV)) a graduate student receives and the attention that they pay to this tutorial (Y, outcome) and is this relationship influenced by their consumption of coffee (Z, moderator)\nmod &lt;- lm(Y ~ Xc + Zc + Xc*Zc)\nsummary(mod)\n## Coefficients:\n##            Estimate Std.

But the data can tell us when a DAG is wrong. **\nMany dynamical systems cannot be usefully represented by DAGs, because they have complex behavior that is sensitive to initial conditions. But these models can still be analyzed and causal interventions designed from them.\nA DAG path means any series of variables you could walk through to get from one variable to another, ignoring the directions of the arrows.\nThe variable, U, in DAGs represents one or more unobserved variables\n\nUsually has circle around the U or is just represented by a dashed line\n\n“Conditioned upon,” “adjusted for,” or “controlled for” is all the same thing\n“a” or “α” is used in bayesian formulas to represent the intercept\nNotation\n\nX is not independent of Y, i.e \nconditional independence: Y is not associated with some variable X, after conditioning on some other variable Z, i.e. \n\nthey are statements of which variables should be associated with one another (or not) in the data.\nthey are statements of which variables become dis-associated when we condition on some other set of variables.\nThere is no other path of influence from X to Y except through Z\n\n\n(Total ) Causal Effect and Direct Causal Effect\n\n\nWeight (W) is the outcome, Height (H) and Sex (S) are explanatory\n(Total) Causal Effect is simply, W ~ S\nDirect Causal Effect shuts the backdoor paths, W ~ S + H\n\nSometimes we want the total causal effect and not the direct causal effect. (e.g. if H is a post-treatment variable, see SR, Ch.6)\n\n\n\n\n\nTestable Implications\n\nDiffering associations between plausible DAGs that are testable through statistical models\nAny DAG may imply that some variables are independent of others under certain conditions.\nNO conditional independencies → NO testable implications\nwww.dagitty.net - Enter DAG and it will give you the Adjustment Set and Testable Implications\nExample\n\nQuestion: What is the causal relationship between Divorce Rate (D), Marriage Rate (M), and Median Age at Marriage (A)\nData:\n\n2 regressions are fit\n\nD ~ α + βM\n\nShows that M is positively correlated with D\n\nD ~ α + βA\n\nShows that A is negatively correlated with D\n\n\n\nPlausible DAGs (note: marriage cannot influence your age… technically)\n\n\n\nA directly influences D\nM directly influences D\nA directly influences M\nReasoning: First, Age can have a direct effect, perhaps because younger people change faster than older people and are therefore more likely to grow incompatible with a partner. Second, it can have an indirect effect by influencing the marriage rate. If people get married earlier, then the marriage rate may rise, because there are more young people. Consider for example if an evil dictator forced everyone to marry at age 65. Since a smaller fraction of the population lives to 65 than to 25, forcing delayed marriage will also reduce the marriage rate. If marriage rate itself has any direct effect on divorce, maybe by making marriage more or less normative, then some of that direct effect could be the indirect effect of age at marriage.\n\n\n\nSimilar to 1 except M does not directly influence D\nReasoning This DAG is plausible even though there’s a correlation between M and D (regression 1). It could be that M derives it’s correlation with D through it’s association with A.\n\nThe direction of influence doesn’t prevent a correlation between M and D\n\n\n\nTestable implications\n\nDAG 1\n\nThe DAG shows all three are associated to each other, i.e. \nIt would be natural to think about measuring correlation and if a pair shows no correlation you could discard the DAG, but it is NOT a good test since there are many ways two variables can show correlation yet not be directly associated. (see reasoning under DAG 2 above and under DAG2 below)\nDAG1 has NO conditional independencies and therefore, NO testable implications\n\nDAG 2\n\nThis DAG also shows all three variables are associated with each other.\nD and M are associated with one another, because A influences them both. They share a cause, and this leads them to be correlated with one another through that cause. But suppose we condition on A. All of the information in M that is relevant to predicting D is in A. So once we’ve conditioned on A, M tells us nothing more about D\nThe testable implication is that D is independent of M, conditional on A, i.e. \n\n(Conditioning on A does not make D independent of M, because M really influences D all by itself in this model.)\n\ni.e A and M are marginally dependent\n\n\n\nOnly difference between both DAGs is the conditional independence in DAG2.\n\nTest\n\nRun a multiple regression D ~ α + βMM + βAA\nIf the effect measured from regression 1 disappears in the multiple regression, then we can discard DAG 1. If the effect remains, then we discard DAG 2.\n\n\nDAGs that are consistent with the data associations (M & N are associated but the causal relationship isn’t known)\n\nwhere U is an unknown variable. Unobserved variables are circled.\n\nAll three DAGs have no conditional independencies and therefore not testable implications\n\nA set of DAGs, each with the same conditional independencies known as a Markov Equivalence\n\nData cannot eliminate any of these DAGS. Domain knowledge must be used to reduce the number of Markov Equivalent DAGs.\n\n\n\n\n“Shutting the backdoor” to potential confounding paths\n\nSection 6.4\nwww.dagitty.net - Enter DAG and it will give you the Adjustment Set and Testable Implications\nRecipe\n\nList all of the paths connecting X (the potential cause of interest) and Y (the outcome).\nClassify each path by whether it is open or closed. A path is open unless it contains a collider.\nClassify each path by whether it is a backdoor path. A backdoor path has an arrow entering X.\nIf there are any backdoor paths that are also open, decide which variable(s) to condition on to close it.\n\nIf you have a choice between two variables where conditioning on either will close a backdoor path and one of them is causal to the outcome variable, then condition on the variable that is causal to the outcome variable. It will add precision to the estimate of the treatment effect.\nAny frontdoor paths that lead to backdoor paths must also be closed (see Misc &gt;&gt; Table 2 fallacy)\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nProblem: We want to measure the causal effect of X –&gt; Y\nPotential confounding paths: XUAC, XUBC\n\nXUAC doesn’t have a collider so a variable needs conditioned on (aka adjusted for)\n\nU is unobserved, so either A or C. C directly influences Y, so it’s more efficient and will “aid in precision.”\n\nXUBC has a collider, B. So, no need to condition on any variable\n\nSolution: Y ~ a + X + C\n\nlibrary(dagitty)\ndag_6.1 &lt;- dagitty( \"dag { \n    U [unobserved]\n    X -&gt; Y\n    X &lt;- U &lt;- A -&gt; C -&gt; Y\n    U -&gt; B &lt;- C\n}\")\nadjustmentSets( dag_6.1 , exposure=\"X\" , outcome=\"Y\" )\n#&gt; { C }\n#&gt; { A }\n\n\nProblem: We want to measure the causal effect of the number of Waffle Houses, W, on Divorce, D.\nPotential confounding paths: WSM, WSA, WSMA (Also WSAM but McElreath on says there are 3. Maybe a combo of same letters is equivalent?)\n\nWSM doesn’t have a collider and therefore either S or M needs conditioned on\nWSA doesn’t have a collider and therefor either S or A needs conditioned on\nWSMA has a collider, M. So that path is blocked\nM is a choice for WSM but it’s a collider so it’s out. S is in both WSM and WSA, so conditioning on it kills two birds.\n\nSolution: D ~ a + W + S\n\nlibrary(dagitty)\ndag_6.2 &lt;- dagitty( \"dag {\n    A -&gt; D\n    A -&gt; M -&gt; D\n    A &lt;- S -&gt; M\n    S -&gt; W -&gt; D\n}\")\nadjustmentSets( dag_6.2 , exposure=\"W\" , outcome=\"D\" )\n#&gt; { A, M }\n#&gt; { S }\n\nEvidently conditioning on A and M is also a solution\n\nConditioning on M does close WSM but would then open WSMA. So, by then conditioning on A which is on a fork (or pipe depending on the path) it closes WSMA.\n\nIn his brms ebook, Kurz fits these regressions and a couple others for comparison. There wasn’t a consensus point estimate for W in the regressions that adjust for S and A + M.\n\nMcElreath mentions, “This DAG is obviously not satisfactory–it assumes there are no unobserved confounds, which is very unlikely for this sort of data.”\nThe inconsistent point estimates are probably do to an omitted variable(s) that is confounding the regression.\n\nConditional independencies:\nimpliedConditionalIndependencies( dag_6.2 )\n#&gt; A _||_ W | S\n#&gt; D _||_ S | A, M, W\n#&gt; M _||_ W | S"

If the predicted risk is lower than the risk for a comorbidity taken on its own—such as, say, the estimated risk for heart disease alone being greater than the risk for heart disease and hypertension, or the risk for metabolic disorders being lower than the risk of someone with no listed comorbidities—our tool delivers the higher number instead. We also smoothed our estimates and confidence intervals, using five-year moving averages by age and gender.”"

It has a rigorous testing process and a conservative approach to updates, which makes it suitable for servers and systems where stability is crucial.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu is based on Debian but tends to be more up-to-date with software packages. It follows a time-based release cycle, with regular releases every six months. This can be appealing if you want access to the latest features and software.\n\nPackage Management:\n\nDebian: Debian uses the Debian Package Management System (dpkg) and Advanced Package Tool (APT) for package management. It has a vast repository of software packages.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu also uses dpkg and APT but adds its own software management tools like Snap and Ubuntu Software Center. This can make software installation more user-friendly.\n\nCommunity and Support:\n\nDebian: Debian has a large and dedicated community, and it’s known for its strong commitment to free and open-source software principles. It has a stable support structure, but community support may not be as user-friendly as Ubuntu’s.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu has a large and active community, and it offers both free and paid support options. The Ubuntu community is known for its user-friendliness and helpful forums, making it a good choice for beginners.\n\nVariants and Flavors:\n\nDebian: Debian offers different flavors, known as “Debian spins,” catering to various needs, such as Debian Stable, Debian Testing, and Debian Unstable. These variants differ in terms of software stability and freshness.\nUbuntu: Ubuntu has several official flavors (e.g., Ubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Server, Kubuntu, Xubuntu) that come with different desktop environments. This variety allows users to choose an environment that suits their preferences.\n\nLicensing:\n\nDebian: Debian has a strict commitment to free and open-source software, prioritizing software that adheres to its Free Software Guidelines.\nUbuntu: While Ubuntu also includes mostly free and open-source software, it may include some proprietary drivers and software by default, which can be a concern for users who prioritize a completely open-source system.\n\nPerformance (Google Search AI)\n\nDebian is considered lightweight and much faster than Ubuntu. It comes with few pre-installed software.\n\nHardware (Google Search AI)\n\nDebian works well on older hardware. Debian still offers a 32-bit version of the distro, while Ubuntu no longer offers a 32-bit version."

Saves from horrible unintended consequences, with typos in variable names.\nWhen you want to access a variable that may or may not have been set, use \"${VARNAME-}\" instead of \"$VARNAME\", and you’re good.\n\nUse set -o pipefail\n\nThis will ensure that a pipeline command is treated as failed, even if one command in the pipeline fails.\n\nUse set -o xtrace, with a check on $TRACE env variable.\n\nFor copy-paste: if [[ -n \"${TRACE-}\" ]]; then set -o xtrace; fi.\nThis helps in debugging your scripts, a lot.\nPeople can now enable debug mode, by running your script as TRACE=1 ./script.sh instead of ./script.sh .\n\n\nExample: Basic Execution a Bash Script\n\nCreate a directory bash_script: mkdir bash_script\nCreate a hello_world.sh file: touch hello_script.sh\nOpen hello_script.sh (text editor?)\nAdd code, save, and close\n    #!/bin/bash\n    echo ‘Hello World’\nMake file executable: chmod +x hello_world.sh\nExecute file: ./hello_world.sh\n\nTemplate\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -o errexit\nset -o nounset\nset -o pipefail\nif [[ -n \"${TRACE-}\" ]]; then\n    set -o xtrace\nfi\nif [[ \"$1\" =~ ^-*h(elp)?$ ]]; then\n    echo 'Usage: ./script.sh arg-one arg-two\nThis is an awesome bash script to make your life better.\n'\n    exit\nfi\ncd \"$(dirname \"$0\")\"\nmain() {\n    echo do awesome stuff\n}\nmain \"$@\"\n\n\n\nJob Management\n\nPrograms/Scripts will by default run in the foreground, and prevent you from doing anything else until the program is done.\nWhile program is running:\n\ncontrol+c - Will send a SIGINT (signal interrupt) signal to the program, which instructs the machine to interrupt the program immediately (unless the program has a way to handle these signals internally).\ncontrol+z - Will pause the program.\n\nAfter pausing the program can be continued either by bringing it to the foreground (fg), or by sending it to the backgroud (bg).\n\n\nExecute script to run in the background: python run.py &\njobs - shows all running jobs and process ids (PIDS)\nkill - sends signals to jobs running in the background\n\nkill -STOP %1 sends a STOP signal, pausing program 1.\nkill -KILL %1 sends a KILL signal, terminating program 1 permanently.\n\n\n\n\ntmux (‘terminal multiplexer’)\n\nEnables you to easily create new terminal sessions and navigate between them. This can be extremely useful, for example you can use one terminal to navigate your file system and another terminal to execute jobs.\nInstallation (if necessary): sudo apt install tmux\n\nTypically comes with the linux installation\n\nSessions\n\ntmux - starts an unnamed session\ntmux new -s moose creates new terminal session with name ‘moose’\ntmux ls - lists all running sessions\ntmux kill-session -t moose - kills session named “moose”\nexit - stops and quits the current session\nKill all sessions (various opinions on how to do this)\n\ntmux kill-session\ntmux kill-server\ntmux ls | grep : | cut -d. -f1 | awk '{print substr($1, 0, length($1)-1)}' | xargs kill\n\n\nAttach/Detach\n\nWhen you log out of a remote machine (either on purpose or accidentally), all of the programs that were actively running inside your shell are automatically terminated. On the other hand, if you run your programs inside a tmux shell, you can come simply detach the tmux window, log out, close your computer, and come back to that shell later as if you’ve never been logged out.\ntmux detach - detach current session\ncontrol+bthen pressd`: When you have multiple sesssions running, this will allow you to select the session to detach\nFrom inside bash and not inside a session\n\ntmux a : attach to latest created session\ntmux a -t moose : attach to session called ‘moose’\n\n\nPane Creation and Navigation\n\ncontrol+b then press ” (i.e. shift+’): add another terminal pane below\ncontrol+b then press % (i.e. shift+5) : add another terminal pane to the right\ncontrol+b then press → : move to the terminal pane on the right (similar for left, up, down)\n\n\n\n\nSSH\n\nTypically uses a key pair to log into remote machines\n\nKey pair consists of a public key (which both machines have access to) and a private key (which only your own machine has access to)\n“ssh-keygen” is a program for generating such a key pair.\n\nIf you run ssh-keygen, it will by default create a public key named “id_rsa.pub” and a private key named “id_rsa”, and place both into your “~/.ssh” directory\nYou’ll need to add the public key to the remote machine by piping together cat, ssh, and a streaming operator\n\ncat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remote 'cat &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'\n\n\n\nConnect to the remote machine: ssh remote -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nCreate a config file instead\n\nLocation: “~/.ssh/config”\nContents\nHost dev\n  HostName remote\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nConnect using config: ssh dev\nFor Windows and using Putty, see\n\nAWS &gt;&gt; EC2 &gt;&gt; Connect to/ Terminate Instance\nProjects Notebook &gt;&gt; Article, Nested Cross Validation &gt;&gt; Notes &gt;&gt; Running EC2 instances checklist\n\n\n\n\nVim\n\nCommand-line based text editor\nCommon Usage\n\nLogging into a remote machine and need to make a code change there. vim is a standard program and therefore usually available on any machine you work on.\nWhen running git commit, by default git opens vim for writing a commit message. So at the very least you’ll want to know how to write, save, and close a file.\n\n2 modes: Navigation Mode; Edit Mode\n\nWhen Vim is launched you’re in Navigation mode\nPress i to start edit mode, in which you can make changes to the file.\nPress Esc key to leave edit mode and go back to navigation mode.\n\nCommands (Cheatsheet)\n\nx deletes a character\ndd deletes an entire row\nb (back) goes to the previous word\nn (next) goes to the next word\n:wq saves your changes and closes the file\n:q! ignores your changes and closes the file\n\n\n\n\nPackages\n\nCommon package managers: apt, Pacman, yum, and portage\nAPT (Advanced Package Tool)\n\nInstall Packages\n# one pkg\nsudo apt-get install &lt;package_name&gt;\n# multiple\nsudo apt-get install &lt;pkg_name1&gt; &lt;pkg_name2&gt;\n\nInstall but no upgrade: sudo apt-get install &lt;pkg_name&gt; --no-upgrade\n\nSearch for an installed package: apt-cache search &lt;pkg_name&gt;\nUpdate package information prior to “upgrading” the packages\nsudo apt-get update\n\nDownloads the package lists from the repositories and “updates” them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies.\n\nUpgrade\n# all installed packages\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n# To upgrade only a specific program\nsudo apt-get upgrade &lt;package_name&gt;\n\n# Upgrades and handles dependencies; delete obsolete, add new\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\n# together\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n\n\n\nExpressions\n\nSort data, filter only unique lines, and write to file: cat adult_t.csv | sort | uniq -c &gt; sorted_list.csv"

If you can stand to wait or be redundant to spawn failures, maybe Google’s hardware acceleration customizability can win the day.\nStats\n\nAWS consistently spawned a new GPU in under 15 seconds (average of 11.4s).\nGCP on the other hand took closer to 45 seconds (average of 42.6s).\nAWS encountered one valid launch error in these two weeks whereas GCP had 84\n\nCaveats\n\nGCP allows you to attach a GPU to an arbitrary VM as a hardware accelerator - you can separately configure quantity of the CPUs as needed.\nAWS only provisions defined VMs that have GPUs attached\n\n\n\nRecommendations\n\nAzure\n\nYou use the Microsoft Office stack (Word, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, etc.) and/or C# programming language.\nYou head neither for the cheapest servers nor for the most expensive ones — you need something in the middle.\nYou need a memory-optimized solution rather than a general-purpose or a compute-optimized one.\nYou read about the current bugs and inconsistencies in Azure, and it does not scare you.\n\nAWS\n\nYou are rich.\nYou have AWS experts in your team.\nYou build an enterprise-level long-term project.\nOR you just want to rent a cheap virtual machine, and you don’t care about all the other facilities.\n\nGCP\n\nYou are a start-up company.\nYou can’t invest much time in learning AWS and dealing with Azure bugs.\nYou don’t need much flexibility and configuration facilities from the cloud.\nYou are ready to accept the approaches dictated by the platform.\nYou need either a general-purpose or a compute-optimized solution, but not a memory-optimized one."

Am I using the complete outputted join result or just a portion? If I end up only making use of column names, or values in one column (as with joins approximating lookup tables), or pairings between two columns, I may be able to instead use $.tbl_df or [.tbl_df (see above, Pull).\n\n\nFor problems even a little bit more complex, e.g. if there were possibly multiple matching or if I wanted to keep all rows, then expressing this join with more bare-bones operations quickly becomes less readable and more error-prone. In those cases, too, joins in dplyr have a relatively small amount of overhead when compared to the vctrs backends underlying them. So, optimize carefully.\nExample: inner_join vs vctrs::vec_slice (Note: *only 0 or 1 match possible*)\nsupplement_my_cars &lt;- function() {\n  # locate matches, assuming only 0 or 1 matches possible\n  loc &lt;- vec_match(my_cars$make_model, mtcars_tbl$make_model)\n\n  # keep only the matches\n  loc_mine &lt;- which(!is.na(loc))\n  loc_mtcars &lt;- vec_slice(loc, !is.na(loc))\n\n  # drop duplicated join column\n  my_cars_join &lt;- my_cars[setdiff(names(my_cars), \"make_model\")]\n  vec_cbind(\n    vec_slice(mtcars_tbl, loc_mtcars),\n    vec_slice(my_cars_join, loc_mine)\n  )\n}\nsupplement_my_cars()\n#&gt; # A tibble: 1 × 13\n#&gt;  make_model    mpg  cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb\n#&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 Honda Civic  30.4    4  75.7    52  4.93  1.62  18.5    1    1    4    2\n#&gt; # ℹ 1 more variable: color &lt;chr&gt;\n\nbench::mark(\n  inner_join = inner_join(mtcars_tbl, my_cars, \"make_model\"),\n  manual = supplement_my_cars()\n) %&gt;%\n  select(expression, median)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 2 × 2\n#&gt;  expression  median\n#&gt;  &lt;bch:expr&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt;\n#&gt; 1 inner_join    438µs\n#&gt; 2 manual      50.7µs\n\nnest\nbench::mark(\n  nest = nest(mtcars_tbl, .by = c(cyl, am)),\n  vctrs = {\n    res &lt;- \n      vec_split(\n        x = mtcars_tbl[setdiff(colnames(mtcars_tbl), nest_cols)],\n        by = mtcars_tbl[nest_cols]\n      )\n\n    vec_cbind(res$key, new_tibble(list(data = res$val)))\n  }\n) %&gt;%\n  select(expression, median)\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 2 × 2\n#&gt;  expression  median\n#&gt;  &lt;bch:expr&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt;\n#&gt; 1 nest        1.81ms\n#&gt; 2 vctrs      67.61µs\n\n# Results of nesting\n#&gt; # A tibble: 6 × 3\n#&gt;    cyl    am data             \n#&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;           \n#&gt; 1    6    1 &lt;tibble [3 × 10]&gt; \n#&gt; 2    4    1 &lt;tibble [8 × 10]&gt; \n#&gt; 3    6    0 &lt;tibble [4 × 10]&gt; \n#&gt; 4    8    0 &lt;tibble [12 × 10]&gt;\n#&gt; 5    4    0 &lt;tibble [3 × 10]&gt; \n#&gt; 6    8    1 &lt;tibble [2 × 10]&gt;\nglue and paste0\nvec_paste0 &lt;- function (...) {\n  args &lt;- vec_recycle_common(...)\n  exec(paste0, !!!args)\n}\n\nname &lt;- \"Simon\"\nbench::mark(\n  glue = glue::glue(\"My name is [{name}]{style='color: #990000'}.\"),\n  vec_paste0 = vec_paste0(\"My name is \", name, \".\"),\n  paste0 = paste0(\"My name is \", name, \".\"),\n  check = FALSE\n) %&gt;% \n  select(expression, median)\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;  expression  median\n#&gt;  &lt;bch:expr&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt;\n#&gt; 1 glue        38.99µs\n#&gt; 2 vec_paste0  3.98µs\n#&gt; 3 paste0    861.01ns\n\npaste0() has some tricky recycling behavior. vec_paste0 is a middle ground in terms of both performance and safety.\nUse glue() for errors, when the function will stop executing anyway.\nFor simple pastes that are intended to be called repeatedly, use vec_paste0()."

They’re within our prediction interval.\nRed: Very large conformal scores indicate high divergence from the true label. These conformal scores are statistically significant and thereby outside of our prediction interval.\n\nCompute confusion matrix (e.g. binary target where labels are 0 and 1)\n\nInterpretation\n\nTop-left: predictions where both labels are not statistically significant (i.e. inside the “prediction interval”).\n\nThe model predicts both classes well since both labels have low scores.\nDepending the threshold, maybe the model could be relatively agnostic (e.g. predicted probabilites like 0.50-0.50, 0.60-0.40)\n\nBottom-right: predictions where both labels are statistically significant  (i.e. outside the “prediction interval”).\n\nModel totally whiffs.

Fits relaxed Lasso and other models.\n\nHas many similarities to {glmnet}. Recommended that you read glmnet vignettes: “An Introduction to glmnet” and “The Relaxed Lasso”\n\n{nestedcv} - Implements nested k*l-fold cross-validation for lasso and elastic-net regularised linear models via the {glmnet} package and other machine learning models via {caret}. Cross-validation of ‘glmnet’ alpha mixing parameter and embedded fast filter functions for feature selection are provided.\n\nWhen you have a smallish dataset such that having sufficient sized (hold-out) test set is unfeasible, using normal k-fold cv for BOTH tuning and error estimation (algorithm comparison) produces biased error estimation.\n\nThe data used for training in some folds are used for testing in other folds which increases the bias of the average error that is calculated across the folds. This bias means the average error rate across the folds can’t be used as an estimate of the error rate of the model on an independent test set.\n\nRepeats should lower this bias and increase robustness in a nested cv framework so that both tuning and selection can be performed simultaneously. Number of repeats depends on how stable the results are.\nStandard deviations should be recorded along with mean scores on the outer loop. If the standard deviations widely vary, then more repeats may be required.\nIf repeats aren’t included, then the nested cv should only be used for algorithm comparison and a separate k-fold cv should be performed afterwards to find the optimal hyperparameters.\n\n\nUse a larger k, number of outer folds, for smaller sample sizes\n\nIn Kuhn’s example, he used 5 repeats of 10-fold cv with each fold comprised of 25 bootstrap resamples for just a 100 row dataset and the error estimate was pretty much balls on.\n\nKuhn used resamples for the inner-loop, but Raschka used folds. So either should be fine.\n\nSteps for algorithm selection:\n\nEntire nested cv procedure is executed for each candidate algorithm\nIf the algorithms make repeats too computationally intensive, then don’t do the repeats. After the algorithm is selected, perform a k-fold cv for hyperparameter tuning.\nFor each algorithm (using repeats):\n\nA complete grid search of all hyperparameters is computed in each inner-resample of each fold of each repeat\n\nIf we have 5 repeats of 10-fold cv with each fold comprised of 25 bootstrap resamples, then there will be 5 * 10 * 25 = 1250 grid search sessions completed\nIn a fold of a repeat, the mean score (e.g. RMSE) and standard deviation are calculated for each hyperparameter value combination across all the resamples’ assessment sets.\n\nThe hyperparameter value combination with the best mean score (e.g. lowest average RMSE) is selected\n\nRepeat for each fold in each repeat\n\nIn a fold of a repeat, the selected hyperparameter values are used to fit on the entire analysis set of the fold.\n\nThe fitted model is scored on the assessment set of the fold\nRepeat for each fold in each repeat\n\nCalculate the average score and standard deviation across all folds for every repeat (i.e. one score value)(e.g. average RMSE)\n\nWith 5 repeats of 10-fold cv:\n\\[\n\\overline {\\text{RMSE}} = \\frac{1}{50} \\sum_{\\text{fold}=1}^{50} \\text{RMSE}_{\\text{fold}}\n\\]\n\n\nThis score is what will be compared during algorithm selection\nThe standard deviations can be used to get a sense of the stability of the scores\n\nRepeat for each algorithm\nChoose the algorithm with the lowest average score\nFor the final model, use the hyperparameter combination chosen most frequently as best during the inner-loop tuning of the winning algorithm.\n\nBates, Hastie, Tibshirani 2021\n\n.632 Bootstrap intervals are typically, but not always, wider than the NCV intervals. The bootstrap point estimates are typically more biased that the NCV point estimates.\nFound that a large number (e.g., 200) of random splits (aka Repeats) of nested CV were needed to obtain stable estimates of the standard error\n“We anticipate that nested CV can be extended to give valid confidence intervals for the difference in prediction error between two models.”\n\nNo details given on this procedure.

    "text": "Time Series\n\nMisc\n\nUsually, the forecast horizon (prediction length), H, equals the number of time periods in the testing data\nAt a minimum, the training dataset should contain at least three times as many time periods as the testing dataset\nIn time series model comparison, CV variance is likely to dominate, and it is more important to reduce the variance than bias. Leave-Few-Observations with joint log score is better than use of Leave-Future-Out (LFO). Cooper et al. (2023) (Vehtari)\n\nTypes\n\n\n(Blue) Training set (including validation fold); (Orange) Test set; (White) Unused\n\nPaper: Evaluating time series forecasting models: An empirical study on performance estimation methods\n\nCode in R\nAlgorithm used: rule-base regression system Cubist (trees)\n\n“other learning algorithms were tested, namely the lasso and a random forest. The conclusions drawn using these algorithms are similar to the ones reported in the next sections.”\nData:\n\nEach of the 62 time series had lengths of either 949, 1338, or 3000.\nhalf-hourly, hourly, and daily frequencies\nIndustries: bike sharing, stock prices from aerospace companies, air quality, solar radiation, and water consumption\n\nBest Performing (i.e. cv error closest hold-out error) (i.e better estimation of generalized performance)\n\nRep-Holdout - Repeated holdout. It’s similar to holdout, but it consists of n estimates. Moreover, differently from holdout, not all the observations are used in a single estimate. A block (e.g. 70%) of the dataset is randomly selected, the first part of that block is used for training and the subsequent part for testing. This procedure is repeated n (e.g. 5) times\n\nVaried length of dataset from a size of 100 to a size of 3000, by intervals of 100 (100, 200, …, 3000). The experiments did not provide any evidence that the size of the synthetic time series had a noticeable effect on the error of estimation methods.\nIn a stationary setting the cross-validation variants are shown to have a competitive estimation ability. However, when non-stationarities are present, they systematically provide worse estimations than the out-of-sample approaches.\nBest method based on summary stats of time series\n\n\nSummary Stats used in the Decision Tree (Tree only used 4 of the stats as splits)\n\nSkewness: For measuring the symmetry of the distribution of the time series;\n5th and 95th Percentiles (Perc05, Perc95) of the standardized time series;\nAcceleration (Accel.): As the average ratio between a simple moving average and the exponential moving average;\nInter-Quartile Range (IQR): as a measure of the spread of the standardized time series;\nSerial Correlation - Estimated using a Box-Pierce test statistic;\nLong-Range Dependence: A Hurst exponent estimation with wavelet transform;\nMaximum Lyapunov Exponent: A measure of the level of chaos in the time series;\nStationary: A boolean variable, indicating whether or not the respective time series is stationary according to the wavelet spectrum test\n\nInterpretation: Rep-Holdout, which is the best method most of the time across the 62 time series, should be used unless the acceleration is below 1.2. Otherwise, the tree continues with more tests in order to find the most suitable estimation method for each particular scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle: 12 Ways to Test Your Forecasts like A Pro\n\nCode in Python\nAlgorithm used: Linear Regression with lags and day-of-the-week variable.\nData: Hyndman datasets - “TSDL consists of 648 datasets, but I selected only the univariate time-series with at least 1,000 observations.” (Turns out to be around 58 datasets I think)\nExperiment: 90% used to perform cv method (cv error); model trained on 90% and tested on the 10% hold-out (hold-out error)\nBest Performing (i.e. cv error closest hold-out error) (i.e better estimation of generalized performance)\n\nInverse holdout: (13 wins) It’s the opposite of holdout: the latest part of the data (usually 75% or 80%) is used for training and the preceding part is used for testing.\npreq_grow: (7 wins) Prequential growing window. n iterations are carried out. At the first iteration, the test set is made of the latest part of observations (e.g. the latest 20%), whereas the first part is used for training. In the following iterations, the test set dimension is progressively reduced, and all the remaining observations are used for training.\npreq_sld_bls: (7 wins) Prequential sliding blocks. Each fold is made only of adjacent points. For each model, one fold is used for training and the subsequent fold is used for testing.\n\n\nExpanding Window or Forward Chaining or Online Training\n\n\nSimulates production environment\npreq-grow method above"

Seems like doing this would result in wasting time rerunning the same dependencies multiple times\n* base\\_orders and base\\_payments are independent in that they can also be used in other models\n* creates more dependable code because you’re using the same logic in all your models\n* Makes runs faster since you aren’t wasting time and resources running the same blocks of code over and over again\n\nYou can schedule running sets of models by tagging them (e.g. #daily, #weekly)\nVersion Control\n\nsnapshots provide mechanism for versioning datasets\nWithin every yaml file is an option to include the version\n\npackage add-ons that allow you to interact with spark, snowflake, duckdb, redshift, etc.\nDocumentation for every step of the way\n\n.yml files can be used to generate a website (localhost:8080) around all of your dbt documentation.\n\n\ndbt docs generate\ndbt docs serve\nCurrent understanding\n    Data is brought in from warehouses via base models and basic transformations are performed (models &gt;&gt;

Therefore, it makes sense to materialize them as tables.\n        * If a table takes too much time to be created (or perhaps it costs too much), then you may also need to consider configuring it as an incremental model.\n    * A mart model should be relatively simple and therefore, too many joins should be avoided\n    * Example\n        * A monthly recurring revenue (MRR) model that classifies revenue per customer per month as new revenue, upgrades, downgrades, and churn, to understand how a business is performing over time.\n            * It may be useful to note whether the revenue was collected via Stripe or Braintree, but they are not fundamentally separate models.\n    Base/Intermediate\n        Base\n            basic transformations (e.g. cleaning up the names of the columns, casting to different data types)\n            \n            Other models use these models as data sources\n                prevents errors like accidentally casting your dates to two different types of timestamps, or giving the same column two different names.\n                    two different timestamp castings can cause all of the dates to be improperly joined downstream, turning the model into a huge disaster\n                    \n            Usually occuring in staging\n            \n            read directly from a source, which is typically a schema in your data warehouse\n                Source object\n                    `{{ source('campaigns', 'channel'){style='color: goldenrod'}[}}]{style='color: goldenrod'}`\n                    \n                * campaigns is the name of the source in the .yml file\n                * channel is the name of a table from that source\n        Intermediate\n            Brings together the atomic building blocks that reside on staging layer such that more complex and meaningful models are constructed\n            \n            Usually occuring in marts\n            \n            Additional transformations that particular marts-models require\n            * Created to isolate complex operations\n                Typically used for joins between multiple base models\n                \n        * Should not be directly exposed to end users via dashboards or applications\n        * Other models should reference them as Common Table Expressions although there may be cases where it makes sense to materialize them as Views\n            * Macros called via `run-operation` cannot reference ephemeral objects such as CTEs\n            * Recommended to start with ephemeral objects unless this doesn’t work for the specific use case\n            * Whenever you decide to materialize them as Views, it may be easier to to do so in a [custom schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/custom-schemas), that is a schema outside of the main schema defined in your dbt profile.\n        * If the same intermediate model is referenced by more than one model then it means your design has probably gone wrong.\n            * Usually indicates that you should consider turning your intermediate model into a macro.\n            reference the base models rather than from a source\n            * Reference object\n                * `{{ ref('base_campaign_types'){style='color: goldenrod'}[}}]{style='color: goldenrod'}`\n                * base\\_campaign\\_types is a base model\n\nTagging\n\nAllows you to run groups of models\n\nExample dbt run --models tag:daily\n\n\nDirectories models Sources (i.e. data sources) are defined in src_ .yml files in your models directory * .yml files contain definitions and tests * .doc files contain source documentation * Models (i.e. sql queries) are defined stg__yml * .yml files contain definitions and tests * .doc files contain source documentation * The actual models are the .sql files Example  * staging: * Different data sources will have separate folders underneath staging (e.g. stripe). * marts: * Use cases or departments have different folders underneath marts (e.g. core or marketing) data contains all manual data that will be loaded to the database by dbt.\n      To load the .csv files in this folder to the database, you will have to run the `dbt seed` command.\n\n      For github or other repos, do not put large files or files with sensitive information here\n          acceptable use cases: yearly budget, status mappings, category mappings, etc\n\nsnapshots\n\ncaptures of the state of a table at a particular time\ndoc\nbuild a slowly changing dimension (SCD) table for sources that do not support change data capture (CDC)\nExample\n\nEvery time the status of an order change, your system overrides it with the new information. In this case, there we cannot know what historical statuses that an order had.\nDaily snapshots of this table builds a history and allows you to track order statuses\n\n\n\nMacros\n\nsimilar to functions in excel\ndefine custom functions in the macros folder or override default macros and macros from a package\nSee bkmks for tutorials on writing custom macros with jinja\n{dbtplyr} macros\n\ndplyr tidy selectors, across, etc.\n\n\nSeeds\n\nSeeds are csv files that you add to your dbt project to be uploaded to your data warehouse.\n\nUploaded into your data warehouse using the dbt seed command\n\nBest suited to static data which changes infrequently.\n\nExamples of use cases:\n\nA list of unique codes or employee ids that you may need in your analysis but is not present in your current data.\nA list of mappings of country codes to country names\nA list of test emails to exclude from analysis\n\n\nReferenced in downstream models the same way as referencing models — by using the ref function\n\n\nPackages\n\npackages.yml\n\nlist of external dbt packages you want to use in your project\n\navailable packages: link\nformat\n\n        packages:\n            - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils\n              version: 0.7.3\n\nInstall packages - dbt deps\nsome of the packages (there are a lot of packages and I didn’t get through them all)\n\n{audit-helper}\n\ncompares columns, queries;

Instead, we can execute one batch at a time. This allows us to execute queries on data that is bigger than memory.\nComplex Data Types: DuckDB can efficiently process complex data types that can be stored in Arrow vectors, including arbitrarily nested structs, lists, and maps.\nAdvanced Optimizer: DuckDB’s state-of-the-art optimizer can push down filters and projections directly into Arrow scans. As a result, only relevant columns and partitions will be read, allowing the system to e.g., take advantage of partition elimination in Parquet files. This significantly accelerates query execution.\n\nExample (using a SQL Query; method 1)\n# open dataset\nds &lt;- arrow::open_dataset(dir_out, partitioning = \"species\")\n# open connection to DuckDB\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())\n# register the dataset as a DuckDB table, and give it a name\nduckdb::duckdb_register_arrow(con, \"my_table\", ds)\n# query\ndbGetQuery(con, \"\n  SELECT sepal_length, COUNT(*) AS n\n  FROM my_table\n  WHERE species = 'species=setosa'\n  GROUP BY sepal_length\n\")\n\n# clean up\nduckdb_unregister(con, \"my_table\")\ndbDisconnect(con)\n\nfiltering using a partition, the WHERE format is ‘&lt;partition_variable&gt;=&lt;partition_value&gt;’\n\nExample (using SQL Query; method 2)\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Reads Parquet File to an Arrow Table\narrow_table &lt;- arrow::read_parquet(\"integers.parquet\", as_data_frame = FALSE)\n\n# Gets Database Connection\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())\n\n# Registers arrow table as a DuckDB view\narrow::to_duckdb(arrow_table, table_name = \"arrow_table\", con = con)\n\n# we can run a SQL query on this and print the result\nprint(dbGetQuery(con, \"SELECT SUM(data) FROM arrow_table WHERE data &gt; 50\"))\n\n# Transforms Query Result from DuckDB to Arrow Table\nresult &lt;- dbSendQuery(con, \"SELECT * FROM arrow_table\")\nExample (using dplyr)\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Open dataset using year,month folder partition\nds &lt;- arrow::open_dataset(\"nyc-taxi\", partitioning = c(\"year\", \"month\"))\n\nds %&gt;%\n  # Look only at 2015 on, where the number of passenger is positive, the trip distance is\n  # greater than a quarter mile, and where the fare amount is positive\n  filter(year &gt; 2014 & passenger_count &gt; 0 & trip_distance &gt; 0.25 & fare_amount &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  # Pass off to DuckDB\n  to_duckdb() %&gt;%\n  group_by(passenger_count) %&gt;%\n  mutate(tip_pct = tip_amount / fare_amount) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    fare_amount = mean(fare_amount, na.rm = TRUE),\n    tip_amount = mean(tip_amount, na.rm = TRUE),\n    tip_pct = mean(tip_pct, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(passenger_count) %&gt;%\n  collect()\n\nIn the docs, the example has to_duckdb after the group_by.

    "section": "Terms",
    "text": "Terms\n\nACID - A database transaction, by definition, must be atomic, consistent, isolated and durable. These are popularly known as ACID properties.  These properties can ensure the concurrent execution of multiple transactions without conflict. Guarantees data validity despite errors and ensure that data does not become corrupt because of a failure of some sort.\n\nCrucial to business use cases that require a high level of data integrity such as transactions happening in banking.\n\nBatch processing - performing an action on data, such as ingesting it or transforming it, at a given time interval.\nBTEQ - Batch Teradata Query (like SQL) is simply a utility and query tool for Teradata which is a relational database system Creating a BTEQ script to load data from a flat-file.\nConcurrency - multiple computations are happening at the same time\nData Dump - A file or a table containing a significant amount of data to be analysed or transferred. A table containing the “data dump” of all customer addresses.\nData Mart - A subset of a data warehouse, created for a very specific business use case. Finance data mart storing all the relevant financial information required by the Accounting team to process their month-end cycles.\nData Integration - Usually, the hardest part of the project, where multiple sources of data are integrated into a singular application/data warehouse. Integrating finance and customer relationship systems integrating into an MS SQL server database.\nData Lake - A repository for all kinds of structured and unstructured data. Mainly based on Hadoop storage technology. Called a lake as it is flexible enough to store anything from raw data to unstructured email files. Hadoop Data Lake. Storing logs of all customers called into the inbound call centre including call duration.\nData Mesh - Decentralized design where data is owned and managed by teams across the organisation that understands it the most, known as domain-driven ownership. tl;dr - Each department controls they’re own data from ingestion to “data products.” This data product is then made a available to the other departments for them to use in their projects. Each department has their own engineers, scientists, and analysts.\n\nEach business unit or domain aims to infuse product thinking to create quality and reusable data products — a self-contained and accessible data set treated as a product by the data’s producers — which can then published and shared across the mesh to consumers in other domains and business units — called nodes on the mesh.\nEnables teams to work independently with greater autonomy and agility, while still ensuring that data is consistent, reliable and well-governed.\nYou don’t have to figure out who’s in charge of what data, who gets to access it, who needs to protect it and what controls and monitoring is in place to ensure things don’t go wrong.\nExample: Banking\n\nCredit risk domain’s own data engineers can independently create and manage their data pipelines, without relying on a centralised ingestion team far removed from the business and lacking in credit expertise. This credit team will take pride in building and refining high-quality, strategic, and reusable data products that can be shared to different nodes (business domains) across the mesh.\n\n\nData Models - A way of organising the data in a way that it can be understood in a real-world scenario. Taking a huge amount of data and logically grouping it into customer, product and location data.\nData Quality - A discipline of measuring the quality of the data to improve and cleanse it. Checking Customer data for completeness, accuracy and validity.\nData Replication - There are multiple ways to do this, but mainly it is a practice of replicating data to multiple servers to protect an organisation against data loss. Replicating the customer information across two databases, to make sure their core details are not lost.\nDenormalization - database optimization technique in which we add redundant data to one or more tables. Designers use it to tune the performance of systems to support time-critical operations. Done in order to avoid costly joins. Me: Seems like it’s kind of like a View except a View might have calculated columns in it.\nDimensions - A data warehousing term for qualitative information. Name of the customer or their country of residence.\nDistributed SQL -  a single logical database deployed across multiple physical nodes in a single data center or across many data centers if need be; all of which allow it to deliver elastic scale and resilience. Billions of transactions can be handled in a globally distributed database.\nEDW - The same as a data warehouse except it includes all the data within an organisation. This means that the entire enterprise can rely on this warehouse for their business decisions. Organising sales, customer, marketing and finance data in an enterprise data warehouse to be able to create several key management reports.\nEmbedded aka In-Process\n\nEmbedded database as in a database system particularly designed for the “embedded” space (mobile devices and so on.) This means they perform reasonably in tight environments (memory/CPU wise.)\nEmbedded database as in databases that do not need a server, and are embedded in an application (like SQLite.) This means everything is managed by the application.\n\nFacts - A data warehousing term for quantitative information. The number of orders placed by a customer.\nFlat File - Commonly used to transfer data due to their basic nature; flat files are a single table storing data in a plain text format. All customer order numbers stored in a comma-separated value (.csv) file\nHTAP - Hybrid Transactional Analytical Processing - System that attempts be good at both OLAP and OLTP\nMaster Data - This is data that is the best representation of a particular entity in the business. This gives you a 360 view of that data entity by generally consolidating multiple data sources. Best customer data representation from multiple sources of information.\nMulti-Master - allows data to be stored by a group of computers, and updated by any member of the group. All members are responsive to client data queries. The multi-master replication system is responsible for propagating the data modifications made by each member to the rest of the group and resolving any conflicts that might arise between concurrent changes made by different members.\n\nAdvantages\n\nAvailability: If one master fails, other masters continue to update the database.\nDistributed Access: Masters can be located in several physical sites, i.e. distributed across the network.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nConsistency: Most multi-master replication systems are only loosely consistent, i.e. lazy and asynchronous, violating ACID properties. (mysql’s multi-master is acid compliant)\nPerformance: Eager replication systems are complex and increase communication latency.\nIntegrity: Issues such as conflict resolution can become intractable as the number of nodes involved rises and latency increases.\n\nCan be contrasted with primary-replica replication, in which a single member of the group is designated as the “master” for a given piece of data and is the only node allowed to modify that data item. Other members wishing to modify the data item must first contact the master node. Allowing only a single master makes it easier to achieve consistency among the members of the group, but is less flexible than multi-master replication.\n\nNiFi - It is an open-source extract, transform and load tool (refer to ETL), this allows filter, integrating and joining data. Moving postcode data from a .csv file to HDFS using NiFi.\nNormalization - A method of organizing the data in a granular enough format that it can be utilised for different purposes over time. Organizing according to data attributes reduces or eliminates data redundancy (i.e. having the same data in multiple places). Usually, this is done by normalizing the data into different forms such as 1NF (normal form) or 3NF (3rd normal form) which is the most common. (See DB, Relational &gt;&gt; Normalization)\n\nTaking customer order data and creating granular information model; order in one table, item ordered in another table, customer contact in another table, payment of the order in another table. This allows for the data to be re-used for different purposes over time.\n\nNULL indexes - These are the indexes that contain a high ratio of NULL values\nObject-Relational Mapping (ORM) - Allows you to define your data models in Python classes, which are then used to create and interact with the database. See {{SQLAlchemy}}\nODS - Operational data store generally stores limited and current information to help simple queries. Unable to handle historical or complex data queries. An ODS for daily stock fluctuations in a warehouse help the warehouse manager decide what to prioritise in the next order delivery.\nOLAP - Online Analytical Processing - large chunks of tables are read to create summaries of the stored data\n\nUse chunked-columnar data representation\n\nOLTP - Online Transactional Processing - rows in tables are created, updated and removed concurrently\n\ntraditionally use a row-based data representation\npostgres excels at this type of processing\n\nRDBMS - Relational database management system. All of the above examples are RDBMS, meaning they store data in a structured format using rows and columns.\n\nA Microsoft SQL server database.\n\nReal-Time Processing (aka Event Streaming) - each new piece of data that is picked up triggers an event, which is streamed through the data pipeline continuously\nReverse ETL - Instead of ETL where data is transformed before it’s stored or ELT where data is stored and transformed while in storage, Reverse ETL performs transformations in the pipeline between Storage and the Data Product.\n\nSCD Type 1–6 - A method to deal with changes in the data over time in a data warehouse. Type 1 is when history is overwritten whereas Type 2 (most common) is when history is maintained each time a change occurs.\n\nWhen a customer changes their address; SCD Type 1 would overwrite the old address with the new one, whereas Type 2 would store both addresses to maintain history.\n\nSchemas - A term for a collection of database objects. These are generally used to logically separate data within the database and apply access controls.\n\nStoring HR data in HR schema allows logical segregation from other data in the organisation.\n\nSharding - Horizontal Partitioning — divides the data horizontally and usually on different database instances, which reduces performance pressure on a single server.\n\nStaging - The name of a storage area that is temporary in nature; to allow for processing of ETL jobs (refer to ETL).\n\nA staging area in an ETL routine to allow for data to be cleaned before loading into the final tables.\n\nTransactional Data - This is data that describes an actual event.\n\nOrder placed, a delivery arranged, or a delivery accepted.\n\nUnstructured Data - Data that cannot be nicely organised in a tabular format, like images, PDF files etc.\n\nAn image stored on a data lake cannot be retrieved using common data query languages."

AND number &gt; 1000\nBest Pactices\n\nAvoid too many indexes\n\nA copy of the indexed column + the primary key is created on disk\nIndexes add to the cost of inserts, updates, and deletes because each index must be updated\nBefore creating an index, see if you can repurpose an existing index to cater to an additional query\nCreate the least possible number of indexes to cover most of your queries (i.e. Covering Indexes).\n\nMakes effective use of the index-only scan feature\nAdd INCLUDE to the create index expression\nExample\n-- query\nSELECT y FROM tab WHERE x = 'key';\n-- covering index, x\nCREATE INDEX tab_x_y ON tab(x) INCLUDE (y);\n-- if the index, x, is unique\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX tab_x_y ON tab(x) INCLUDE (y);\n\ny is called a non-payload column\n\nDon’t add too many non-payload columns to an index. Each one duplicates data from the index’s table and bloat the size of the index.\n\n\nExample: Query with function\n-- query\nSELECT f(x) FROM tab WHERE f(x) &lt; 1;\n-- covering index, x\nCREATE INDEX tab_f_x ON tab (f(x)) INCLUDE (x);\n\nWhere f() can be MEAN, MEDIAN, etc.\n\n\n\nFix unusable indexes\n\nIssues related to data types, collation (i.e. how it’s sorted), character set (how the db encodes characters), etc\nSometimes you can make the indexes work by explicitly forcing the optimizer to use them. (?)\n\nRepurpose or delete stale indexes\n\nIndexes are designed to serve an existing or a future load of queries on the database\nWhen queries change, some indexes originally designed to serve those queries might be completely irrelevant now\nAutomate stale index removal. Dbs keep statistics. Write a script to either notify you or just delete the index if it’s older and not been used past a certain threshold\n\nUse the most cost efficient index type\n\nExample: If your use case only needs a regular expression search, you’re better off having a simple index than a Full Text index.\n\nFull Text indexes occupy much more space and take much more time to update\n\n\nDon’t index huge tables (&gt; 100M rows), partition instead\n\nThen prune the partitions (partition pruning) you don’t need and create indexes for the partitioned tables you do keep.\n\n\nPartitioning\n\nAlso see Google, BigQuery &gt;&gt; Optimization &gt;&gt; Partition and Cluster\nSplits your table into smaller sub-tables under the hood\n\nNot viewable unless you check the table directory to see the multiple files that have been created\n\nThe same goes for indexes on that table.\n\n\nUse on tables with at least 100 million rows (BigQuery recommends &gt; 1 GB) Partitioning helps reduce table size and, in turn, reduces index size, which further speeds up the Data Warehouse (DWH) operations. But, partitioning also introduces complexity in the queries and increases the overhead of managing more data tables, especially backups. So try a few of the other performance techniques before getting to Sharding.\nPartition columns should always be picked based on how you expect to use the data, and not depending on which column would evenly split the data based on size.\n\nExample: partition on county because your analysis or transformations will largely be done by county even though since some counties may be much larger than others and will cause the partitions to be substantially imbalanced.\n\n\nUse ELT (e.g. load data from on-prem server to cloud, then transform) instead of ETL (transform data while on-prem, then load to cloud) for data pipelines\n\nMost of the time you have a lot of joins involved in the transformation step\n\nSQL joins are one of the most resource-intensive commands to run. Joins increase the query’s runtime exponentially as the number of joins increases.\nExample\n\nRunning 100+ pipelines with some pipelines having over 20 joins in a single query.\nEverything facilitated by airflow (see bkmk for code)\nETL: postgres on-prem server, sql queries with joins, tasks ran 12+ hours, then the transformed data is loaded to google storage\n\n13+ hrs for full pipeline completion\n\nELT: running the queries with the joins, etc. with bigquery sql on the data after it’s been loaded into google storage.\n\n6+ hrs for full pipeline completion\n\n\n\n\nUse Materialized Views\n\nA smaller data object that contains the subset of data resulting from a specific query\nWhereas a query happens after data is loaded, a materialized view is a precomputation\nThe computation is done once, and changes to the data are incorporated as they occur, making subsequent updates to the view much cheaper and more efficient than querying the entire database from scratch\n\nFetching a large table will be slower if you try to use multiple cores.\n\nYou have to divide up the table and recombine it. Plus setting up parallel network processes takes time.\nThe time used to fetch some data from the internet depends massively on the internet bandwidth available on your router/network.\n\nUse Random Access via http range header + sparse-hilbert index to optimize db for query searches\nCITEXT extension makes it so you don’t have use lower or upper which are huge hits on performance (at least they are in WHERE expressions) GIN custom indexes for LIKE and ILIKE\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gin;\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;\nCREATE INDEX index_users_on_email_gin ON users USING gin (email gin_trgm_ops);\n\nCREATE EXTENSION adds btree and pg_trgm extensions\nindex_users_on_email_gin is the name of the index\nusers is the table\nUSING gin (email gin_trgm_ops)\n\ngin specifies that it’s a gin index\nemail is the field\ngin_trgm_ops is from the pg_trgm extension. It splits the index into trigrams which is necessary for the gin index to work with LIKE or ILIKE\n\nSlower to update than the standard ones. So you should avoid adding them to a frequently updated table.\n\nGiST indexes are very good for dynamic data and fast if the number of unique words (lexemes) is under 100,000, while GIN indexes will handle 100,000+ lexemes better but are slower to update.\n\n\nNULLS LASTputs the NULLS in a field in any sorting operations at the end\n\nThe default behavior of ORDER BY will put the NULLS first, so if you use LIMIT , you might get back a bunch of NULLS.\nUsing NULLS LAST fixes this behavior but its slow even on an indexed column\n\nExample: ORDER BY email DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 10\n\nInstead use two queries\nSELECT *\nFROM users\nORDER BY email DESC\nWHERE email IS NOT NULL LIMIT 10;\n\nSELECT *\nFROM users\nWHERE email IS NULL LIMIT 10;\n\nThe first one would fetch the sorted non-null values. If the result does not satisfy the LIMIT, another query fetches remaining rows with NULL values.\n\n\nRebuild Null Indexes\nDROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY users_reset_token_ix;\nCREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY users_reset_token_ix ON users(reset_token)\nWHERE reset_token IS NOT NULL;\n\nDrops and rebuilds an index to only include NOT NULL rows\nusers_reset_token_ix is the name of the index\nusers is the table\nI assume “reset_token has to be the field\n\nWrap multiple db update queries into a single transaction\n\nImproves the write performance unless the database update is VERY large.\nA large-scale update performed by a background worker process could potentially timeout web server processes and cause a user-facing app outage\nFor large db updates, add batching\n\n[Example]{.ribbon-highlight: db update has a 100K rows, so update 10K at a time.\nUPDATE messages SET status = 'archived'\n  WHERE id IN\n  (SELECT ID FROM messages ORDER BY ID LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 0);\nUPDATE messages SET status = 'archived'\n  WHERE id IN\n  (SELECT ID FROM messages ORDER BY ID LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 10000);\nUPDATE messages SET status = 'archived'\n  WHERE id IN\n  (SELECT ID FROM messages ORDER BY ID LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 20000);\n\nmessages is the table name\nI guess OFFSET is what’s key here."

    "section": "Database Triggers",
    "text": "Database Triggers\n\n\nA database trigger is a function that gets triggered every time a record is created or updated (or even deleted) in the source table (in this case, a transactional table)\nDatabase triggers provide an effective, solution to extracting data from the transactional system and seamlessly integrating it into the data warehouse while also not adversely impacting that system.\nUse case — You see a couple of data points in your transactional system’s tables that you would require for your reporting metrics but these data points are not being provided by your transactional system’s API endpoints. So, there is no way you can write a script in Python or Java to grab these data points using the API. You cannot use direct querying on your transactional system as it can negatively impact its performance.\nMisc\n\nNotes from Harnessing Triggers in the Absence of API Endpoints\n\nProvides a detailed step-by-step\n\nIf your transactional system does not have a lot of traffic (or) is not directly used by end-user applications, then it can be set up as a synchronous process. In that case, the lambda or the Azure functions would need to have the trigger event as the transactional database’s staging table. The appropriate database connection information would also need to be provided.\n\nDatabase Triggers\n\nDDL Triggers - Set up whenever you want to get notified of structural changes in your database\n\nUseful when you wish to get alerted every time a new schema is defined; or when a new table is created or dropped. Hence, the name DDL (Data Definition Language) triggers.\n\nDML Triggers - Fired when new records are inserted, deleted, or updated\n\ni.e. You’re notified anytime a data manipulation change happens in a system.\n\n\nSyntax: &lt;Timing&gt; &lt;Event&gt;\n\nTrigger Event - The action that should activate the trigger.\nTrigger Timing - Whether you need the trigger to perform an activity before the event occurs or after the event occurs.\n\nSpecialized triggers provided by cloud services\n\nAWS\n\nLambda Triggers: These triggers help initiate a lambda function when a specified event happens. Events can be internal to AWS, or external in nature. Internal events can be related to AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB streams, or Amazon Kinesis. External events can come in from the database trigger of a transactional system outside of AWS or an IoT event.\nCloudwatch Events: If you have used standalone relational databases such as Microsoft SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), you may have used SQL Server Agent to notify users of a job failure. Cloudwatch is specific to AWS and is used not only to notify users of a job failure but also to trigger Lambda functions and to respond to events. The important difference between a CloudWatch Event and a Lambda Trigger is that while Lambda triggers refer to the capability of AWS Lambda to respond to events, CloudWatch Events is a broader event management service that can handle events from sources beyond Lambda. On a side note, while SQL Server Agent requires an email server to be configured, Cloudwatch has no such requirement.\n\nAzure\n\nBlob Trigger: Azure blobs are similar to S3 buckets offered by AWS. Similar to how Amazon S3 notifications can be used to get alerts about changes in S3 buckets; blob triggers can be used to get notified of changes in Azure blob containers.\nAzure Function Trigger: These are the Azure equivalent of AWS Lambda Function Triggers. These triggers can be used to initiate an Azure function in response to an event within Azure or an external event, such as an external transactional database trigger, an HTTP request, or an IoT event hub stream. Azure functions can also be initiated based on a pre-defined schedule using a Timer Trigger.\n\n\nExample: Transfer data from a transactional database to a warehouse (See article for further details)\n\nIdentify table in transactional db with data you want\nCreate a staging table that’s exactly like the transaction table\n\nEnsure that you don’t have any additional constraints copied over from the source transactional table. This is to ensure as minimal impact as possible on the transactional system.\nFor a bulk data transfer of historical transaction data:\n\nCREATE TABLE AS SELECT (SELECT * INTO in SQL Server) while creating the staging table. This will create the staging table pre-populated with all the data currently available in the transaction table.\nDo an empty UPDATE on all the records in the transaction table\n\ne.g. UPDATE TABLE Pricing_info SET OperationDate=OperationDate\nThis is not a recommended approach as it could bog down the transactional system due to the number of updates and undo statements generated. Moreover, the transaction table will also be locked during the entire update operation and will be unavailable for other processes thus impacting the transactional system. This method is okay to use if your transaction table is extremely small in size.\n\n\nIn addition to that, also have a column to indicate the operation performed such as Insert, Update, Delete).\n\nSet up a DML trigger directly on the transaction table\n\nAll DML events namely Insert, Delete, and Update in the transaction table should have a separate trigger assigned to them.\n\nThe below example shows the trigger for Insert. The rest of the triggers are created similarily — just by substituting 2 INSERTs (trigger event, select statement) for DELETE or UPDATE (See article for code) and using a different name in CREATE\n\nInsert trigger in (SQL Server)\n-- Create the trigger\nCREATE TRIGGER TransactionTrigger_pricing_Insert\nON Pricing_info\n--Trigger Event\nAFTER INSERT\nAS\nBEGIN\n    -- Insert new records into the staging table\n    INSERT INTO StagingTable_pricing (ID, Column1, Column2, OperationType)\n    SELECT ID, Column1, Column2, 'INSERT'\n    FROM inserted\nEND;\n\n“Pricing_info” is the name of transactional table with the data you want\n“StagingTable_pricing” is the name of the staging table\nAFTER INSERT where AFTER is the trigger timing and INSERT is the trigger event\nIn the SELECT statement, “INSERT” is the value for that extra column in the staging table that tells us which type of operation this was.\n\n\nSet-up the specialized trigger in the warehouse\n\nAWS \n\nA database DML trigger in the transactional system’s database. Whenever a new record comes into the transactional database table, the trigger would insert the new data into a staging table within the transactional database.\n\nIf you based it on a schedule (using AWS Cloudwatch events), the Lambda trigger would trigger a lambda function to grab the data from the staging table to a table in the datawarehouse (Redshift)\n\n\nAzure \n\nWhen the timer trigger activates, it would run the Azure Function which would then pick up the new/updated/deleted records from the staging table."

cost, etc.\nHarm is set to 1 / 30 = 0.03333…\n\n\nharm_marker = 0.0333\n\n# conditional approach: only patients at intermediate risk have their marker measured\nintermediate_risk = ifelse(risk_group==\"intermediate\", c(1), c(0))\n\n# harm of the conditional approach is proportion of patients who have immediate risk multiplied by the harm\n# 0.014874\nharm_conditional = mean(intermediate_risk)*harm_marker\n\n#Run the decision curve\ndca(data=data.set, outcome=\"cancer\", predictors=c(\"high_risk\", \"joint\",\n\"conditional\"), harm=c(0, harm_marker, harm_conditional),\nxstop=0.35)\n\nharm arg\n\nharm = 0 for predictor == high_risk (i.e. harm not applied)\nharm_marker for predictor == joint (i.e. constant)\nharm_conditional for predictor == conditional (i.e. proportion of patients who have immediate risk multiplied by the harm_marker)\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nConditional approach now consistently has the higher net benefit but at a risk threshold around 0.34 it has less benefit than Treat All\n\nFewer genetic marker tests means less harm for the Conditional approach\nHarm has a sizeable effect on the Joint approach by lowering it’s net benefit a few points.\n\nJoint approach has negative benefit at about 0.31 risk threshold.\n\n\nExample Unnecessary interventions avoided\ndca(data=data.set, outcome=\"cancer\", predictors=\"marker\", probability=FALSE,\nintervention=TRUE, xstart=0.05, xstop=0.35)\n\nThis seems to be the FP calculation (See Steps: dca function)\nInterpretation: “At a probability threshold of 15%, the net reduction in interventions is about 33 per 100 patients. In other words, at this probability threshold, biopsying patients on the basis of the marker is the equivalent of a strategy that reduced the biopsy rate by 33%, without missing any cancers.”\n\nComparing Traditional Decision Analysis with Model-Based DCA (article)\n\n\nIn traditional decision analysis, all potential outcomes must be assigned a utility.\n\nTrue Negative → no biopsy, no cancer: utility = 1\n\nthe outcome of no biopsy in a patient without cancer, the best possible outcome\n\nFalse Positive → biopsy, no cancer: utility = 0.95\n\nUnnecessary intervention\nAssigning this 0.95 is confusing to me since usually higher utility is related to higher satisfaction. It may be that if you’re given a positive test, and even with the painful biopsy, it’s extremely satisfying to get a confirmation of a negative result.\n\nTrue Positive → biopsy, cancer: utility = 0.80\n\nfinding a high-grade cancer\n\nFalse Negative → no biopsy, cancer: utility = 0.35\n\nMissing a cancer increases the risk of toxic treatment, metastasis and death\n\n\n(traditional) net benefit = (Expected utility of the model – utility of false negative) ÷ (utility of true positive – utility of false negative)\nTraditional Net Benefit vs DCA Net Benefit\n\nTraditional net benefit equals the DCA net benefit at the rational risk threshold (bolded row)\n\nRational risk threshold Pt can be obtained as Pt ÷ (1 - Pt ) = (utility of true positive – utility of false negative) ÷ (utility of true negative – utility of false positive)\nPt ÷ (1 - Pt ) = (utility of 0.8 – 0.35) ÷ (1 – 0.95) = 9 and hence Pt = 10%\n\nAs shown in the chart, the “treat-all” model (blue) can only be used when the threshold probability is less than the prevalence (i.e. treat-all net benefit &gt; 0). This rule is violated when using traditional DA. Therefore, DCA is better suited for model comparison.\n\nI didn’t include the table that shows this. For details, see table 1 at the 25% cut-point in the article."

App not performing as well in production as it did during CV How does your algorithm work exactly?\n\nWhat’s the app ecosystem like in which the algorithm exists?\nHow are the algorithm’s music curations linked to the user’s current mood?\n\n\nIdentify key entities and sort them Create a list of the key entities that impact the problem and are linked to it. These entities might be people, algorithms, processes, places, protocols, and more. (commonly around 20 entities)\n\nSort the list by specificity and/or importance.\nHelps you to uncover the hierarchy\n\nOutline the map and fill it in Start adding entities according to your hierarchy and understanding of the problem\n\nWrite the actual action of the said connection by adding phrases to the arrows like “adds to”, “creates”, “selects from”, “picks according to” Some of these boxes (e.g. algorithm) might have their specific concept maps. It all depends on the level of specificity you need/want to use.\nExample (see example description above)\n\n\n\n\nIceberg Model\n\nHelps you to notice what are the underlying causes and implications of a system or event\nComponents Events: What is happening right now? What is being asked? What do we know for sure?\n\nPatterns: Are there any trends? Has this happened before? What historical data do we have?\nStructures: What might produce the patterns? How are the parts connected? Where do the parts originate from and where do they end?\nMental Models: Are there any beliefs, assumptions, or other mental models on which the system is built? What kind of Mental Models are they and how do they behave?\n\nExample: Bank needs forecast of the amount of money taken out from their ATMs, 30 days in advance, and daily Events Follow-up questions: Why? For what use case? Why 30 days? Why daily? How often do they provision the ATM?\n\nFollow-up answers:\n\n30 days seems like a convenient number so they picked that one\n\nknowing when an ATM will run out would make them fill it sooner and/or prioritize it hence the daily request\nthey provision the ATMs every week\nSince they’re provisioned weekly, should the forecast be made weekly instead of daily\n\nDoes making more forecasts (daily) add more uncertainty to the prediction than a weekly forecast?\n\nPatterns and Structions\n\nsalary – when people get paid, ATMs get used more often\nlocation – ATMs at urban locations will be used more often\nweather – if the weather is horrible people won’t go outside that much\ncalendar – before events like Christmass people might use the ATMs more. What about other ethnicities and religions?\n\n\n\nSix Thinking Hats Approaching the problem from different standpoints should lead us to the right decision\n\nEach team member get one type of hat\n\ncreativity – brainstorm ideas and let them run wild in many directions.\npositivity – ponder all the benefits of an approach/decision.\nnegativity – ponder all the downsides and look for weaknesses.\nemotions – how do you feel about this? What does your gut say? Why?\nanalytical – focus on the data and be VERY rational.\ncontrolling – moderate the other hats so that you make progress. Watch out if one of them becomes too prominent and blocks the others from speaking.\n\n\nThe Cynefin Framework\n\nProblem categories\n\nClear - everything is clearly defined if straightforward cause-and-effect knowledge\n\nOften solely requires the use of best practices to solve a problem and the solutions are easy to spot.\nCourse of action: understand the problem - categorize it - respond\n\nComplicated - requires some pondering and might have multiple competing solutions\n\nCharacterized by known unknowns that often require some domain expert guidance\nCourse of action: understand the problem - analyze it - respond\n\nComplex - obscure problems that aren’t clear enough at first and require investigation of the problem and its context\n\nCourse of action: investigate and bring the problem to the Complicated category\n\nChaotic - causal relationships are unclear The goal is to bring the problem down to the Complex category\nDisorder - you don’t know in what category your problem is in.\n\nCourse of action: dissect the problem into multiple smaller ones and try categorizing those\n\n\n\nFirst Principles\n\nBoil down the problem to the most basic components that don’t need/can’t be boiled down further What is the first principle (aka basic truth) for a domain expert might not be the one for you\nProcess:\n\nBreak the problem down into basic truths\n\nSocratic Method: you start with one question and pose another one when you get the answer and you go until you reach the basic truth. 5 Whys: Ask ourselves 5 times Why is something the case\n\nUse the basic truths to find the solution\n\nExample: see Iceberg Model &gt;&gt; Example: Bank ATM forecasting\n\nFirst Principles\n\nATMs need to be refilled\nsome ATMs need to be refilled sooner than others\nATMs differ in the amount of money in them\nthe bank wants something that works\nthe problem we’re facing is (?)\n\nPotential approaches based on first principles\n\nRegression\n\nTotal money left in an ATM daily\nDaily prediction of taken out money\n\nClassification\n\nDaily % chance for the ATM to empty out\n\nAggregation\n\nSummed amount of predicted ATM money take-outs\n\nOptimization\n\nThe best route to take for money transportation\n\nSurvival\n\nHow many days until an ATM is empty?\n\n\n\n\nInversion Approach\n\nView the problem from a different angle and/or consider the worst possible scenarios Start thinking of bad solutions and ask yourself why is it bad and how can it be improved upon\nExample: Imagine a project/solution failed. Ask why did it fail. Ask the team to brainstorm together why it failed, what was done/gone wrong, what mistakes we made, what we didn’t consider, and more."

When k &gt; 0.5, then the distribution has infinite variance. PSIS weights perform well as long as k &lt; 0.7. Large k values can be used to identify influential observations (i.e. rare observations/potential outliers).\n\nFor brms, warnings for high k values will show when using add_criterion(brms_mod, \"loo\") \nOutliers make it tough to estimate out-of-sample accuracy, since rare values are unlikely to be in the new sample. (i.e. overfitting risk)\nAlso, warnings about high k values can occur when the sample size is small\n\nWhen looking at the posterior, keep in mind that “influential” data values might be significantly affecting the posterior distribution.\n\nSolutions\n\nIf there are only a few outliers, and you are sure to report results both with and without them, dropping outliers might be okay.\nIf there are several outliers, then a form of Robust Regression can be used or a Mixture Model.\n\nCommon to use a Student’s T distribution instead of a Gaussian for the outcome variable specification\n\nThe Student-t distribution arises from a mixture of Gaussian distributions with different variances. If the variances are diverse, then the tails can be quite thick.\nHas an extra shape parameter, ν, that controls how thick the tails are.\n\nν = ∞ is a Gaussian distribution\nAs v –&gt; 1+ , tails start becoming fat\nν can be estimated with very large datasets that have plenty of rare events\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n# shows k values for all data points below 0.5 threshold\nloo::loo(b8.3) %&gt;% \n  plot()\n# K values\ntibble(k = b8.3$criteria$loo$diagnostics$pareto_k, \n      row = 1:170) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(k))\n# k value diagnostic table - shows how many are points have bad k values and that group's min n_eff\nloo(b8.3) %&gt;% loo::pareto_k_table()\n\nWidely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC)\n\nDeviance with a penalty term based on the variance of the outcome variable’s observation-level log-probabilities from the posterior\nEstimates out-of-sample deviance\n\nloo pkg: brms::waic\n\n“elpd_waic”: larger is better\n“waic”:  is just (-2 * elpd_waic) to convert it to deviance scale, therefore smaller is better\nMay need to use add_criterion(brms_fit, \"waic\") in order to use the waic function\n\nRethinking pkg: smaller is better\n\nEffective number of parameters, pwaic (aka the penalty term or overfitting penalty)\n\nSays compute the variance in log-probabilities for each observation i, and then sum up these variances to get the total penalty.\nCalled such because in ordinary linear regressions the sum of all penalty terms from all points tends to be equal to the number of free parameters in the model\n\nWhen the sum is larger than the number of free parameters, it can indicate an outlier is present which will increase the overfitting risk.\n\nSee Solutions for outliers under PSIS &gt;&gt;  Shape parameter, k\n\n\nWeights\n\nThese weights can be a quick way to see how big the differences are among models.\nEach model weight is essentially a proportion of it’s WAIC or PSIS difference compared to the total of all the WAIC or PSIS differences.\n\nLarger is better\n\nExample\n\n\nbrms::model_weights(b8.1b, b8.2, b8.3, weights = \"loo\") %&gt;%\n        round(digits = 2)\n## b8.1b  b8.2  b8.3 \n##  0.00  0.03  0.97\n\nInterpretation:\n\nb8.3 has more than 95% of the model weight. That’s very strong support for including the interaction effect, if prediction is our goal.\nThe modicum of weight given to b8.2 suggests that the posterior means for the slopes in b8.3 are a little overfit.\n\nBayes Factor\n\nThe ratio (or difference when logged) of the average likelihoods (the denominator of bayes theorem) of two models.\nSince the average likelihood has been averaged over the priors, it has a natural penalty for more complex models\nProblems\n\nEven when priors are weak and have little influence on posterior distributions within models, priors can have a huge impact on comparisons between models.\nNot always possible to compute the average likelihood"

A well-calibrated model is one that minimizes residuals.\nCalibration-in-the-Large - mean calibration\n\nHarrell: “compares the average Y-hat with the average Y (does the model get the right result on average).”\n\naverage predicted risk compared with the overall event rate\n\nConcerned with gross measurements of calibration, such as:\n\nWhether the model’s overall expected number of events exceeds the observed number\nWhether the proportion of expected over observed events departs significantly from “1”\n\n\nCalibration-in-the-Small - means that each of your model’s predicted probabilities, i.e. 0.01, 0.02, …, 0.99, occur exactly at that proportion in the observed data/real world\n\ni.e., for all the times when the predicted risk was 0.4, the outcome happened about 0.4 of the time.\nMore important than calibration-in-the-large. Required for good decision making using risk models.\nHarrell: Assesses the absolute forecast accuracy at the individual levels of Y-hat.\nSmooth calibration curves visualizes this (See Calibration &gt;&gt; Calibration Plots &gt;&gt; Harrell)\n\nA curve close to the diagonal indicates that predicted risks correspond well to observed proportions\n\n“calibration-in-the-tiny” the next step: for males in which the prediction was 0.4 was the outcome present 0.4 of the time, then for females.\n\nDiscrimination - The ability of the predictive model to predict the observed class. It’s not a particular performance measure. Typically AUROC, Somers’ Dxy\n\nPredictive discrimination is the ability to rank order subjects\nExample: The higher the ratio of patients who have high predicted risk probabilities / patients who actually have the disease, the better the discrimination by the model\n\n“High” is determined by a cutpoint or threshold\n\n\nExternal Validity - The extent to which your results can be generalized to other contexts. Assesses the applicability or generalizability of the findings to the real world. So, your study had significant findings in a controlled environment. But will you get the same results outside of the lab?\nInternal Validity - The degree of confidence that the causal relationship you are testing is not influenced by other factors or variables. Evaluates a study’s experimental design and methods. Studies that have a high degree of internal validity provide strong evidence of causality.\n\nUsing CV or bootstrapping is sometimes referred to as performing internal validation\n\nProper Scoring Rule (SO discussion + Harrell links) - A score assesses whether a probabilistic forecast is close to the true distribution. A score that is minimized in expectation if the predictive density is the true density.\n\nLoss functions that map predicted probabilities and corresponding observed outcomes to loss values, which are minimized in expectation by the true probabilities (p,1−p). The idea is that we take the average over the scoring rule evaluated on multiple (best: many) observed outcomes and the corresponding predicted class membership probabilities, as an estimate of the expectation of the scoring rule\nAlso\n\nStrictly proper scoring rules -rules that are only minimized in expectation if the predictive density is the true density\nImproper scoring rules - (e.g. Accuracy)"

If you look at the mean value in the prostate dataset for recurrence, it is 0.1708861, which means that 17% of the participants experienced a recurrence of prostate cancer. If you are calculating the mean of 315 of the 316 observations, and you know the overall mean of all 315, you (mathematically) know the value of the last observation - recurrence or not - it has no degrees of freedom. So for 316 observations, you have n-1 or 315, degrees of freedom. For each predictor in your model you ‘use up’ one degree of freedom.

    "text": "Deviance Metrics\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from Saturated Models and Deviance video\nDeviance is 2 * Log Likelihood\n\nLog likelihood can usually be extracted from the model object (e.g. ll_proposed &lt;- mod$logLik)\n\nSaturated Model also called the Full model (Also see Regression, Discrete &gt;&gt; Misc)\n\nThe full model has a parameter for each observation and describes the data perfectly while the reduced model provides a more concise description of the data with fewer parameters.\nUsually calculated from the data themselves\ndata(wine, package = \"ordinal\")\ntab &lt;- with(wine, table(temp:contact, rating))\n## Get full log-likelihood (aka saturated model log-likelihood)\npi.hat &lt;- tab / rowSums(tab)\n(ll.full &lt;- sum(tab * ifelse(pi.hat &gt; 0, log(pi.hat), 0))) ## -84.01558\n\nGOF: as a rule of thumb, if the deviance about the same size as the difference in the number of parameters (i.e. pfull - pproposed), there is NOT evidence of lack of fit. ({ordinal} vignette, pg 14)\n\nExample (have doubts this is correct)\n\nLooking at the number of params (“no.par”) for fm1 in Example: {ordinal}, model selection with LR tests below and the model summary in Proportional Odds (PO) &gt;&gt; Example: {ordinal}, response = wine rating (1 to 5 = most bitter), the number of parameters for the reduced model is the number of regression parameters (2) + number of thresholds (4)\nFor the full model (aka saturated), the number of thresholds should be the same, and there should be one more regression parameter, an interaction between “temp” and “contact”. So, 7 should be the number of parameters for the full model\nTherefore, for a good-fitting model, the deviance should be close to pfull - preduced = 7 - 6 = 1\nThis example uses “number of parameters” which is the phrase in the vignette but I think it’s possible he might mean degrees of freedom (dof) which he immediatedly discusses afterwards. In the LR Test example below, under LR.Stat, which is essentially what deviance is, the number is around 11 which is quite aways from 1. Not exactly an apples to apples comparison, but the size after adding 1 parameter just makes me wonder if dof would match this scale of numbers for deviances better.\n\n\n\nResidual Deviance (G2): Dresid = Dsaturated - Dproposed\n\n2*log_likelihood between a saturated model and the proposed model\n\n2 *(LL(sat_mod) - LL(proposed_mod))\n-2 * (LL(proposed_mod) - LL(sat_mod))\n\nSee example 7, pg 13 ({ordinal} vignette) for (manual) code\nYour residual deviance should be lower than the null deviance. You can even measure whether your model is significantly better than the null model by calculating the difference between the Null Deviance and the Residual Deviance. This difference [281.9 - 246.8 = 35.1] has a chi-square distribution. You can look up the value for chi-square with 2 degrees (because you had 2 predictors) of freedom. Or you can calculate this in R with pchisq(q = 35.1, df=2, lower.tail = TRUE) which gives you a p value of 1.\n\nNull Deviance: Dnull = Dsaturated - Dnull\n\nAs a GOF for a single model, a model can be compared to the Null model (aka intercept-only model)\n2*log_likelihood between a saturated model and the intercept-only model (aka Null model)\n\n2 *(LL(sat_mod) - LL(null_mod))\n-2 * (LL(null_mod) - LL(sat_mod))\n\n\nMcFadden’s Pseudo R2 = (LL(null_mod) - LL(proposed_mod)) / (LL(null_mod) - LL(saturated_mod))\n\nThe p-value for this R2 is the same as the p-value for:\n\n2 * (LL(proposed_mod) - LL(null_mod))\nNull Deviance - Residual Deviance\n\nFor the dof, use proposed_dof - null_dof\n\ndof for the null model is 1\n\n\n\nExample: Getting the p-value\nm1 &lt;- glm(outcome ~ treat)\nm2 &lt;- glm(outcome ~ 1)\n(ll_diff &lt;- logLik(m1) - logLik(m2))\n## 'log Lik.' 3.724533 (df=3)\n1 - pchisq(2*ll_diff, 3)\n\nLikelihood Ratio Test (LR Test) - For a pair of nested models, the difference in −2ln L values has a χ2 distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in number of parameters estimated in the models being compared.\n\nRequirement: Deviance tests are fine if the expected frequencies under the proposed model are not too small and as a general rule they should all be at least five.\n\nAlso see Discrete Analysis notebook\n\nExample\n\nχ2 = (-2)*log(model1_likelihood) - (-2)*log(model2_likelihood) = 4239.49 – 4234.02 = 5.47\n\n-2*log can probably be factored out\n\ndegrees of freedom = model1_dof - model2_dof = 12 – 8 = 4\npval &gt; 0.05 therefore the likelihoods of these models are not signficantly different\n\n\nCompare nested models\n\nExample: LR Test Manually\n\nModels\nmodel1 &lt;- glm(TenYearCHD ~ ageCent + currentSmoker + totChol, \n              data = heart_data, family = binomial)\nmodel2 &lt;- glm(TenYearCHD ~ ageCent + currentSmoker + totChol + \n                as.factor(education), \n              data = heart_data, family = binomial)\n\nAdd Education or not?\n\nExtract Deviances\n# Deviances\n(dev_model1 &lt;- glance(model1)$deviance)\n## [1] 2894.989\n(dev_model2 &lt;- glance(model2)$deviance)\n## [1] 2887.206\nCalculate difference and test significance\n# Drop-in-deviance test statistic\n(test_stat &lt;- dev_model1 - dev_model2)\n## [1] 7.783615\n\n# p-value\n1 - pchisq(test_stat, 3)  # 3 = number of new model terms in model2 (i.e. 3(?) levels of education)\n## [1] 0.05070196\n\n\nExample: LR test with anova\nanova(fm2, fm1)\n\nLikelihood ratio tests of cumulative link models:\n    formula:                link:  threshold:\nfm2 rating ~ temp          logit  flexible\nfm1 rating ~ temp + contact logit  flexible\n    no.par AIC    logLik  LR.stat df Pr(&gt;Chisq)\nfm2 5      194.03 -92.013\nfm1 6      184.98 -86.492  11.043  1  0.0008902 ***"

You need to specify directly the model-object, the data frame used for fitting the model, the function that should be used to compute predictions, and the model label.\n{DALEXtra} has helper functions set-up to support {{sklearn}}, {{keras}}, {h2o}, {mlr3}, {tidymodels}, and {xgboost} models.\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory Levels\n\n\nInstance Level\n\nThe model exploration for an individual instance starts with a single number — a prediction. This is the top level of the pyramid.\nTo this prediction we want to assign particular variables, to understand which are important and how strongly they influence this particular prediction. One can use methods as SHAP, LIME, Break Down, Break Down with interactions. This is the second from the top level of the pyramid.\nMoving down, the next level is related to the sensitivity of the model to change of one or more variables’ values. Ceteris Paribus profiles allow to explore the conditional behaviour of the model.\nGoing further, we can investigate how good is the local fit of the model. It may happen, that the model is very good on average, but for the selected observation the local fit is very low, errors/residuals are larger than on average. The above pyramid can be further extended, i.e. by adding interactions of variable pairs.\n\nDataset Level\n\nThe exploration for the whole model starts with an assessment of the quality of the model, either with F1, MSE, AUC or LIFT/ROC curves. Such information tells us how good the model is in general.\nThe next level helps to understand which variables are important and which ones make the model work or not. A common technique is permutation importance of variables.\nMoving down, methods on the next level help us to understand what the response profile of the model looks like as a function of certain variables. Here you can use such techniques as Partial Dependence Profiles or Accumulated Local Dependence.\nGoing further we have more and more detailed analysis related to the diagnosis of the errors/residuals.\n\n\n\n\nInstance Level\n\nUse Case:\n\nInvestigate extreme response values\nInvestigate observations not predicted well by your model\n\n\n\nBreak-Down (BD)\n\nAllows you to see how predictor variables contribute to prediction.\nBD Charts shows additive contributions of variables when they are sequentially added to the model\nBreak-down (BD) plots and Shapley values are most suitable for models with a small or moderate number of explanatory variables. Neither of those approaches is well-suited for models with a very large number of explanatory variables, because they usually determine non-zero attributions for all variables in the model.\n\nFor data with many predictors, use LIME.\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nModel predicts survival probability of a person on the Titanic\nintercept is the mean of all the predictions from of the model on the training data\nFixing age = 8 adds 0.27 probability points to the mean overall prediction\nFixing age = 8 and class = 1st adds \\((0.27 + 0.086 = 0.356)\\) to the mean overall prediction\nprediction is the point prediction for an observation that has all of these predictors fixed at these values\n\nWhen interactions, whether explicit like in linear regression models or implicit like in Random Forest models, are present in the model, the order that the predictors are presented to the DALEX function affects the estimated contribution.\n\n\nWhen interactions aren’t present in the model, then contributions should be the same regardless of ordering of the predictors.\nHere class and age have been presented to the DALEX function is different orders and have different contributions which shows that the RF model is using an interaction of the two predictors.\n\nExample: Assume No Interactions\nlibrary(\"randomForest\")\nlibrary(\"DALEX\")\nexplain_rf &lt;- \n  DALEX::explain(model = titanic_rf,  \n                 data = titanic_imputed[, -9],\n                 y = titanic_imputed$survived == \"yes\", \n                 label = \"Random Forest\")\nbd_rf &lt;- \n  predict_parts(explainer = explain_rf,\n                new_observation = henry,\n                type = \"break_down\")\nbd_rf\n##                                     contribution\n## Random Forest: intercept                   0.235\n## Random Forest: class = 1st                 0.185\n## Random Forest: gender = male              -0.124\n## Random Forest: embarked = Cherbourg        0.105\n## Random Forest: age = 47                   -0.092\n## Random Forest: fare = 25                  -0.030\n## Random Forest: sibsp = 0                  -0.032\n## Random Forest: parch = 0                  -0.001\n## Random Forest: prediction                  0.246\n\nplot(bd_rf) will plot the BD chart\ntype - The method for calculation of variable attribution; the possible methods are “break_down” (the default), “shap”, “oscillations”, and “break_down_interactions”\norder - A vector of characters (column names) or integers (column indexes) that specify the order of explanatory variables to be used for computing the variable-importance measures; if not specified (default), then a one-step heuristic is used to determine the order\nkeep_distributions - A logical value (FALSE by default); if TRUE, then additional diagnostic information about conditional distributions of predictions is stored in the resulting object and can be plotted with the generic plot() function.\n\nWhen this is TRUE, plot will output the BD plot, but instead of point estimates of the contributions for each predictor, violin plots visualize the distribution of contribution values.\nThere are also lines that connect predictions from one distribution to the next distribution which indicates how each model prediction changed wthen the next predictor was added.\nNot very aesthetically pleasing. If you want to use these distributions in a presentation and aren’t concerned with the lines, I’d recommend getting the values and making a raincloud plot with {{ggdist}} or some other package.\n\n\nExample: Assume Interactions\n\n##                                             contribution\n## Random Forest: intercept                           0.235\n## Random Forest: class = 1st                         0.185\n## Random Forest: gender = male                      -0.124\n## Random Forest: embarked:fare = Cherbourg:25        0.107\n## Random Forest: age = 47                           -0.125\n## Random Forest: sibsp = 0                          -0.032\n## Random Forest: parch = 0                          -0.001\n## Random Forest: prediction                          0.246\n\nSame code as before except in predict_parts, type = “break_down_interactions”\n\nFinds an ordering of the predictors in which the most important predictors are placed at the beginning\n\niBD detects an important interaction between fare and class\nCan be time consuming as the running time is quadratic depending on the number of predictors, \\(O(p^2)\\). \\(\\frac{p(p+1)}{2}\\) net contributions for single variables and pairs of variables have to be calculated.\nFor datasets with a small number of observations, the calculations of the net contributions will be subject to a larger variability and, therefore, larger randomness in the ranking of the contributions.\n\n\n\n\nLime\n\nArtificial data is generated around the neighborhood of instance of interest. Predictions are generated by the black-box model. A glass-box model (e.g. lasso, decision-tree, etc.) is trained on the artificial data and predictions. Then, the glass-box model is used as a proxy model for the black-box model for interpreting that instance.\nWidely adopted in the text and image analysis but also suitable for tabular data with many predictors\n\nFor models with large numbers of variables, sparse explanations with a small number of variables offer a useful alternative to BD and SHAP.\n\nIssues\n\nRequires numeric predictors, so different LIME methods will have different transformations of the categorical variables and will provide different results.\nThe glass-box model is selected to approximate the black-box model, and not the data themselves, the method does not control the quality of the local fit of the glass-box model to the data. Thus, the latter model may be misleading.\nSometimes even slight changes in the neighborhood where the artificial data is generated can strongly affect the obtained explanations.\n\nSee Ch. 9.6 for discussion of some of the differences in LIME implementation between {lime}, {localModel}, and {iml}.\nExample: {localModel}\nlibrary(\"localModel\")\nlocMod_johnny &lt;- \n  DALEXtra::predict_surrogate(explainer = explain_rf, \n                              new_observation = johnny_d, \n                              size = 1000, \n                              seed = 1,\n                              type = \"localModel\")\nlocMod_johnny[,1:3]\n##     estimated                        variable original_variable\n## 1  0.23530947                    (Model mean)                  \n## 2  0.30331646                     (Intercept)                  \n## 3  0.06004988                   gender = male            gender\n## 4 -0.05222505                    age &lt;= 15.36               age\n## 5  0.20988506     class = 1st, 2nd, deck crew             class\n## 6  0.00000000 embarked = Belfast, Southampton          embarked\n\ntype = “localModel” says which package to use\n\n{lime} and {iml} available\n\nestimated shows the coefficients of a LASSO glass-box model\nNote the dichotomization of the continuous variable, age\n\nCutpoint chosen using ceteris-paribus profiles.

For a variable that exercises little or no influence on a model’s prediction, the profile will be flat or will barely change.\nFor categoricals or discrete variables, bar graphs are used to visualize the CP values.\nIssues\n\nCorrelated explanatory variables may lead to misleading results , as it is not possible to keep one variable fixed while varying the other one.\nIf an interaction is present, whether explicit like in linear regression models or implicit like in Random Forest models, results can be misleading.\n\nPairwise interactions require the use of two-dimensional CP profiles that are more complex than one-dimensional ones.\n\n\nProcess\n\nSupply a single observation with values of your choice and a predictor.\nThat predictor varies while the others in the model are held constant, and predictions are calculated.\nResponses are plotted vs the predictor.\n\nExample: Compare 2 observations\n\nvariable_splits = list(age = seq(0, 70, 0.1), \n                       fare = seq(0, 100, 0.1))                      )\ncp_titanic_rf2 &lt;- \n  predict_profile(explainer = explain_rf, \n                  new_observation = rbind(henry, johnny_d),\n                  variable_splits = variable_splits)\nlibrary(ingredients)\nplot(cp_titanic_rf2, \n     color = \"_ids_\", \n     variables = c(\"age\", \"fare\")) + \n  scale_color_manual(name = \"Passenger:\", \n                     breaks = 1:2, \n                     values = c(\"#4378bf\", \"#8bdcbe\"), \n                     labels = c(\"henry\" , \"johny_d\")) \n\npredict_profile\n\nvariables - (Not used in this example) Names of explanatory variables, for which CP profiles are to be calculated.

Available if you want to use a custom grid of variables and values.\ntype\n\ntype = “oscillations” is used when variable_splits is used. An average residual is what’s being calculated, and one main difference in the types is the divisor (e.g. number of unique values, sample size) that’s used. Here, I’m guessing this argument value sets the divisor to the number of grid values in variable_splits.\ntype = “oscillations_uni” assumes a uniform distribution of the “residuals” which are differences between the CP value and prediction for that instance.\n\nFilters variables to only unique values\nQuicker to compute\n\ntype = “oscillations_emp” assumes an empirical distribution of the “residuals”\n\nPreferred when there are enough data to accurately estimate the empirical distribution and when the distribution is not uniform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Diagnostics\n\nCheck how the model behaves locally for observations similar to the instance of interest.\nNeighbors of the instance of interest are chosen using a distance metric that includes all variables — default being the gower distance which handles categorical and continuous variables.\nLocal Fidelity\n\nCompares the distribution of residuals for the neighbors with the distribution of residuals for the entire training dataset.\nA histogram with both sets of residuals is created.\n\nBoth distributions should be similar. But, if the residuals for the neighbors are shifted towards positive or negative values, then the model has issues predicting instances with variable values in this space.\n\nNon-parametric tests such as Wilcoxon or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can also be used to test for differences.\n\nLocal Stability\n\nChecks whether small changes in the explanatory variables, as represented by the changes within the set of neighbors, have got much influence on the predictions.\nCP profiles are calculated for each of the selected neighbors\n\nAdding residuals to the plot allows for evaluation of the local model-fit.\n\nInterpretation\n\nParallel lines suggests the relationship between the variable and the response is additive.\nA small distance between the lines suggests model predictionss are stable for values of that variable around the supplied value.\n\n\nExample\n\nLocal-Fidelity\n\nid_rf &lt;- \n  predict_diagnostics(explainer = explain_rf,\n                      new_observation = henry,\n                      neighbours = 100)\nid_rf\n##  Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\n## \n## data:  residuals_other and residuals_sel\n## D = 0.47767, p-value = 4.132e-10\n## alternative hypothesis: two-sided\nplot(id_rf)\n\nKS-Test indicates a statistically significant difference between the two distributions\nThe plot suggests that the distribution of the residuals for Henry’s neighbours might be slightly shifted towards positive values, as compared to the overall distribution.\nI don’t think the y-axis values are informative.

However, a small fraction of the random forest-model residuals is very large, and it is due to them that the RMSE is comparable for the two models.\nThe separation of the red dot (mean) and line (median) indicate that the residual distribution is skewed to the right.\n\nResiduals vs Observation ID\n\nmd_rf &lt;- model_diagnostics(explainer_ranger)\nplot(md_rf, variable = \"ids\", yvariable = \"residuals\")\n\nShows an asymmetric distribution of residuals around zero, as there is an excess of large positive (larger than 500) residuals without a corresponding fraction of negative values (i.e. right-skewed distribution)\n\nResiduals vs Fitted - plot(md_rf, variable = \"y_hat\", yvariable = \"residuals\")\n\n\nShould be symmetric around the horizontal at zero\nSuggests that the predictions are shifted (biased) towards the average.\n\nResiduals vs Observed - plot(md_rf, variable = \"y\", yvariable = \"residuals\")\n\n\nShould be symmetric around the horizontal at zero\nShows that, for the large observed values of the dependent variable, the residuals are positive, while for small values they are negative. This trend is clearly captured by the smoothed curve included in the graph. Thus, the plot suggests that the predictions are shifted (biased) towards the average.

See if one of the models that has the variable ranked higher captures a different (e.g. non-linear) relationship with response better than the other models\n\nThe permutation step means there some randomness involved, so it should be repeated many times. This will give you a distribution of importance values for each variable. Then, you can calculate a an interval based on a chosen quantile to represent the uncertainty.\nOverview\n\nTakes a variable, randomizes its rows, measures change in loss function from full model.\nVars that have largest changes are of greater importance (longer bars).\n\nSome of the Args\n\nN = 1000 (default), = NULL to use whole dataset (slower).\nB = 10 (default) - Number of iterations (i.e. number of times you go through the permutation process for each variable)\nType = “raw” (default) is just the value of loss function.

For models with interactions, CP profiles may not be parallel.\n\nUse Cases\n\nAgreement between profiles for different models is reassuring. Some models are more flexible than others. If PD profiles for models, which differ with respect to flexibility, are similar, we can treat it as a piece of evidence that the more flexible model is not overfitting and that the models capture the same relationship.\nDisagreement between profiles may suggest a way to improve a model. If a PD profile of a simpler, more interpretable model disagrees with a profile of a flexible model, this may suggest a variable transformation that can be used to improve the interpretable model. For example, if a random forest model indicates a non-linear relationship between the dependent variable and an explanatory variable, then a suitable transformation of the explanatory variable may improve the fit or performance of a linear-regression model.\n\nExample:\n\npdp_lmr &lt;- \n  model_profile(explainer = explainer_lmr, \n                         variables = \"age\")\npdp_rf &lt;- \n  model_profile(explainer = explainer_rf, \n                        variables = \"age\")\nplot(pdp_rf, pdp_lmr) +\n    ggtitle(\"Partial-dependence profiles for age for two models\") \n\nLeft: Indicates that the linear regression isn’t capturing u-shape relationship\nRight: Indicates that the RF may be underestimating the effect\n\n\nEvaluation of model performance at boundaries. Models are known to have different behaviour at the boundaries of the possible range of a dependent variable, i.e., for the largest or the lowest values. For instance, random forest models are known to shrink predictions towards the average, whereas support-vector machines are known for a larger variance at edges. Comparison of PD profiles may help to understand the differences in models’ behaviour at boundaries.\n\nChecks\n\nHighly Correlated Variables\n\nPD profiles inherit the limitations of the CP profiles. In particular, as CP profiles are problematic for correlated explanatory variables may offer a crude and potentially misleading summarization\nIf highly correlated, use Accumulated Local Profies\n\nCheck CP profile for consistent behavior\n\nPD profiles are estimated by the mean of the CP profiles for all instances (observations) from a dataset (i.e. CP profiles are instance-level PD profiles).\nThe mean (i.e. PD) may not be representative of the relationship of the variable and the response\nIf the CP prole lines are parallel, then the PD profile is representative\nSolutions (If not parallel):\n\nCluster CP profiles - Cluster the CP profiles (e.g. k-means) and the entroids will be the PD lines\n\nExample\n\npdp_rf_clust &lt;- \n  model_profile(explainer = explainer_rf, \n                variables = \"age\", \n                k = 3)\nplot(pdp_rf_clust, \n     geom = \"profiles\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Clustered partial-dependence profiles for age\") \n\nGrouped-by CP profiles - Group CP profiles by a moderator variable\n\nDistinctive PD lines can indicate an interaction\nExample\n\npdp_rf_gender &lt;- \n  model_profile(explainer = explainer_rf, \n                variables = \"age\", \n                groups = \"gender\")\nplot(pdp_rf_gender, \n     geom = \"profiles\") + \n    ggtitle(\"Partial-dependence profiles for age, grouped by gender\") \n\nGender looks like a good candidate for an interaction\n\n\n\nExample: RF survival model\n\n\nThe shape of the PD profile does not capture, for instance, the shape of the group of five CP profiles shown at the top of the panel.\nIt does seem to reflect the fact that the majority of CP profiles (predicted probabilities below 0.75) suggest a substantial drop in the predicted probability of survival for the ages between 2 and 18.\n\n\n\nSteps\n\nDetermine grid space of j evenly spaced values across distribution of selected predictor, x\nFor value i in {1,…,j} of grid space\n\nset x == i for all n observations (x is a constant variable)\napply given ML model\nestimate n predicted values\ncalculate the average predicted value\n\ngraph y_hat vs x\n\nCode\npdp_rf &lt;- model_profile(explainer = explainer_rf, variables = \"age\")\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nplot(pdp_rf) +  ggtitle(\"Partial-dependence profile for age\") \n\nOther Args\n\nN - The number of (randomly sampled) observations that are to be used for the calculation of the PD profiles (N = 100 by default); N = NULL implies the use of the entire dataset included in the explainer-object.\nvariable_type - A character string indicating whether calculations should be performed only for “numerical” (continuous) explanatory variables (default) or only for “categorical” variables.\ngroups - The name of the explanatory variable that will be used to group profiles, with groups = NULL by default (in which case no grouping of profiles is applied).\nk - The number of clusters to be created with the help of the hclust() function, with k = NULL used by default and implying no clustering.\ngeom = “profiles” in the plot function, we add the CP profiles to the plot of the PD profile.\n\n\n\n\n\nFunnel Plot\n\nFrom {DALEXtra}, lets us find subsets of data where one of models is significantly better than other ones.\nVery useful in situations where we have models that have similiar overall performance, but where predictive performance of units with certain characteristics are more important to our business than others.\nCan be used to create a sort of ensemble model where predictions from different models are used depending on the values of the predictors.\nExample\n\nexplainer_lm &lt;- \n  explain_mlr(model_lm, \n              apartmentsTest, \n              apartmentsTest$m2.price, \n              label = \"LM\", \n              verbose = FALSE, \n              precalculate = FALSE)\nexplainer_rf &lt;- \n  explain_mlr(model_rf, \n              apartmentsTest, \n              apartmentsTest$m2.price, \n              label = \"RF\",\n              verbose = FALSE, \n              precalculate = FALSE)\n\n plot_data &lt;- \n   funnel_measure(explainer_lm, \n                  explainer_rf,\n                  partition_data = cbind(apartmentsTest,\n                                         \"m2.per.room\" = apartmentsTest$surface/apartmentsTest$no.rooms),\n                  nbins = 5, \n                  measure_function = DALEX::loss_root_mean_square, \n                  show_info = FALSE)\n\nnbins is the number of bins to partition continuous variables into.\nmeasure_function is the metric used to judge each model. Here RMSE is used.\nLength of segment is the difference in prediction performance. The longer the segments are, the better that model is at predicting for those subsets of data.\nFor the most expensive and the cheapest (i.e. first and last bin of m2.price), the linear regression model performs best, while the random forest model performs best average priced (i.e. middle 3 bins of m2.price) apartments.\nThe linear regression is extremely better at predicting prices for apartments in the Srodmiescie district."

    "section": "auditor",
    "text": "auditor\n\nFor GOF measure, model similarity comparison using residuals. Also, uses residual plots and scores to check for asymmetry (around zero) in the distribution, trends, and heteroskedacity.\nAuditor objects only require a predict function and response var in order to be created.\nUsually scores use score(auditor_obj, type = “?”, …), plots use plot(auditor_obj, type = “?”, … )\nPlot function can facet multiple plots, e.g. plot(mod1, mod2, mod3, type = c(“ModelRanking”, “Prediction”), variable = “Observed response”, smooth = TRUE, split = “model”). smooth = TRUE adds a trend line. Split arg splits prediction vs observed plot into plots for each model.\nRegression Error Characteristic (REC) plot- GOF measure - type = “REC” - The y-axis is the percentage of residuals less than a certain tolerance (i.e. size of the residual) with that tolerance on the x-axis. The shape of the curve illustrates the behavior of errors. The quality of the model can be evaluated and compared for different tolerance levels. The stable growth of the accuracy does not indicate any problems with the model. A small increase of accuracy near 0 and the areas where the growth is fast signalize bias of the model predictions (jagged curve).\nArea Over the REC Curve (AOC) score - GOF measure - type = “REC” - is a biased estimate of the expected error for a regression model. Provides a measure of the overall performance of regression model. Smaller is better I’d think.\nRegression Receiver Operating Characteristic (RROC) plot - type = “RROC” - for regression to show model asymmetry. The RROC is a plot where on the x-axis we depict total over-estimation and on the y-axis total under-estimation.\nArea Over the RROC Curve score - GOF measure - type = “RROC” - equivalent to the error variance. Smaller is better I’d think\nModel Ranking plot and table - Multi-GOF measure - type = “ModelRanking” - radar plot of potentially five scores: MAE, MSE, RMSE, and the AOC scores for REC and RROC. They’ve been scaled in relation to the model with the best score for that particular metric. Best model for a particular metric will be farthest away from the center of the plot. In the table, larger scaled score is better while lower is better in the plain score column. You can also add a custom score function but you need to make sure that a lower value = best model.\nResiduals Boxplot - asymmetry measure - type = “ResidualBoxplot” - Pretty much the same as a regular boxplot except there’s a red dot which stands for the value of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Values are the absolute value of the residuals. Best models will have medians around zero and small spreads (i.e. short whiskers). Example in the documentation has a good example showing how a long whisker pulls the RMSE which is sensitive to outliers towards the edge of the box.\nResidual Density Plot - asymmetry measure - type = “ResidualDensity” - detects the incorrect behavior of residuals. For linear regressions, residuals should be normally distributed around zero. For other models, non-zero centered residuals can indicate bias. Plot has a rug which makes it possible to ascertain whether there are individual observations or groups of observations with residuals significantly larger than others. Can specify a cat predictor variable and see the shape of the density of residuals w.r.t. the levels of that variable.\nTwo-sided ECDF Plot - type = “TwoSidedECDF” - stands for Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions. There’s an cumulative distribution curve for each positive and negative residuals. The plot shows the distribution of residuals divided into groups with positive and negative values. It helps to identify the asymmetry of the residuals. Points represent individual error values, what makes it possible to identify ‘outliers’\nResiduals vs Fitted and autocorrelation plots - type = “Residual”, type = “Autocorrelation” - same thing as base R plot. Any sort of grouping, trend, or pattern suggests an issue. Looking for randomness around zero. Can specify a cat predictor variable and see the trend of residuals w.r.t. the levels of that variable.\nAutocorrelation Function Plot (ACF) - autocorrelation check - type = “ACF” - same evaluation as a ACF plot for time series\nScale-Location Plot - type = “ScaleLocation” - The y-axis is the sqrt(abs(std_resids)) and x-axis is fitted values. Different from Resid vs Fitted since that plot uses raw residuals instead of scaled. Equation shows the resids are divided by their std.dev, so that should fix the variance at 1. The presence of any trend suggests that the variance depends on ﬁtted values, which is against the assumption of homoscedasticity. Not every model has an explicit assumption of homogeneous variance, however, the heteroscedasticity may indicates potential problems with the goodness-of-ﬁt. Residuals formed into separate groups suggest a problem with model structure (specification?)\nPeak Test - - type = “Peak” - tests for heteroskedacity. Score’s range is (0, 1]. Close to 1 means heteroskedacity present.\nHalf-Normal Plot - GOF measure - type = “HalfNormal” - graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. Method takes info from the model and simulates response values. Your model is then fitted with the simulated response variable and residuals created. A dotted line 95% CI envelope is created from these simulated residuals. If your residuals come from the normal distribution, they are close to a straight dotted line. However, even if there is no certain assumption of a speciﬁc distribution, points still show a certain trend. Simulated envelopes help to verify the correctness of this trend. For a good-ﬁtted model, diagnostic values should lay within the envelope.\nHalf-Normal Score - GOF measure - scoreHalfNormal(auditor_obj)\n\nCount the number of simulated residuals for observation_i that are greater or equal than resid_i. If the number is around 0.5 the number of simulated residuals, m, then the model residual doesn’t differ that much from the simulated residuals which is a good thing.\nThat calc is repeated for each residual.\nScore = sum(abs(count_i - (m/2)))\nScore’s range = [0, (nm)/2], where n is the number of observations\nLower value indicates better model fit.\n\nModel PCA Plot - Similarity of models comparison - type = “ModelPCA” - vector arrows represent the models and the gray dots are the model residuals. The smaller the angle between the models, the closer their residual structure. Arrows perpendicular the residual dots mean that model’s residuals likely represent that structure. Parallel means not likely to represent that structure.\nModel Correlation Plot - Similarity of models comparison - type = “ModelCorrelation” - Densities in the diagonal are each models fitted response values. Correlations in upper right triangle are between models and between each model and the observed response.\nPredicted Response Plot (aka predicted vs observed) - GOF measure - type = “Prediction” - Should randomly envelop the diagonal line. Trends can indicate values of the response where the model over/under predicts. Groupings of residuals suggest problems in model specification.\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve - classification GOF measure - type = “ROC” - True Positive Rate (TPR) (y-axis) vs False Positive Rate (FPR) (x-axis) on a threshold t (probability required to classify something as an event happening) where t has the range, [0,1]. Each point on the ROC curve represents values of TPR and FPR at different thresholds. The closer the curve is to the the left border and top border of plot, the more accurate the classiﬁer is.\nAUC score - GOF measure - type = “ROC” - guideline is &gt; 0.80 is good.\nLIFT charts - classification GOF measure - type = “LIFT” - Rate of Positive Prediction (RPP) plotted (y-axis) vs number of True Positives (TP) (x-axis) on a threshold t.\n where P is the total positive classifications (TP + FP) predicted for that threshold and N is the total negative (TN + FN). The ideal model is represented with a orange/yellow curve. The model closer to the ideal curve is considered the better classifier.\nCook’s Distances Plot - influential observations - type = “CooksDistance” - a tool for identifying observations that may negatively affect the model. They can be also used for indicating regions of the design space where it would be good to obtain more observations. Data points indicated by Cook’s distances are worth checking for validity. Cook’s Distances are calculated by removing the i-th observation from the data and recalculating the model. It shows an inﬂuence of i-th observation on the model. The 3 observations (default value) with the highest values of the Cook’s distance are marked with the row number of the observation. The guideline seems to be a Cook’s Distance (y-axis) &gt; 0.5 warrants further investigation."

The “output value” is the model’s prediction.\nThe feature values for the largest effects are printed at the bottom of the plot.\n\ndecision plot - Examines influences behind one predicted value that you input to the function. Pretty much the same exact thing as the breakdown plot in DALEX.\n\nThe straight vertical line marks the model’s base value. The colored line is the prediction.\nStarting at the bottom of the plot, the prediction line shows how the SHAP values (i.e., the feature effects) accumulate from the base value to arrive at the model’s predicted output at the top of the plot.\nThe feature name on the y-axis is bordered by 2 horzontal grid lines. In the graph, the way the prediction line behaves in between these horizontal grid lines of the feature visualizes the SHAP value, e.g. a negative slope would be equal to the blue arrow in the force plot.\nThe feature values for the largest effects are in parentheses.\nFor multi-variate classification\n\nUsing lines instead of bars (like in breakdown plots) allows it to visualize the influences behind a multi-class outcome prediction where each line is for a category level probability. But the x-axis actually represents the raw (SHAP?) score, not a probability. (I think there’s an option for x-axis as probabilities)\nThe magnitude of score shows strength of confidence in the prediction. A negative score says the model thinks that category level is not the case. For example, if the category level is “no disease”, then a large negative score means the model says there’s strong evidence that disease is present (score was -2.12 so I guess that’s strong).\n\nCan vary one predictor between a range or set of specific values and keep the rest of predictors constant. For classification, you could ask which predictors dominate influence for high probability predictions? Then use the plot to compare predictor behavior.\nCan compare how influences are different for an observation by multiple models."

Alternatively, I also spun up an instance of Label Studio with a PostgreSQL backend but I decided not to use it for this competition due to the unnecessary overhead.\nFor the pre-trained model, I used ResNet50 trained on ImageNet.\nI used the Annoy package to perform approximate nearest neighbor search.\nThe number of nearest neighbors to retrieve per misclassified validation image is a hyper-parameter.\n\n\n\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) \n\nMisc\n\nNotes from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture Explained in Plain English Using Simple Diagrams\n\nEspecially designed to work with images. They are widely used in the domain of computer vision\n\nTo use MLPs with images, we need to flatten the image. If we do so, spatial information (relationships between the nearby pixels) will be lost. So, accuracy will be reduced significantly. CNNs can retain spatial information as they take the images in the original format.\nCNNs can reduce the number of parameters in the network significantly. So, CNNs are parameter efficient.\n\nImages\n\ngrayscale image is represented as (height, width, 1) or simply (height, width) since the 3rd dim is 1\nRGB image is represented as (height, width, 3), where 3 is the number of color channels in the image (3D array)\n\nLayers\n\nConvolutional layers\n\nThe first convolutional layer takes the images as the input and begins to process\n\nThere can be multiple convolutional layers\nThe ReLU activation is used in each convolutional layer\n\nExtracts a set of features from the image while maintaining relationships between the nearby pixels\nComponents and Operations (fig: Gray scale, 1 Filter)\n\nConvolutional Operation is a partial matrix multiplication: 1st row (image) * 1st col (kernel) + 2nd row (image) * 2nd col (kernel) +…\n\ne.g. (0*0 + 3*0 + 0*1) + (2*1 + 0*1 + 1*0) + (0*1 + 1*0 + 3*0) = 3\nExample is row*col but evidently it can also be row*row or col*col. Probably doesn’t matter as long as it’s consistent.\n\nKernel (aka Filter or Feature Detector)\n\nThere can be multiple filters in a single convolutional layer\n\nMultiple filters are used to identify a different set of features in the image\n\nThe number of filters increases in each convolutional layer\n\ne.g if we use 16 filters in the first convolutional layer, we usually use 32 filters in the next convolutional layer, and so on\n\nThe size of the filter and the number of filters should be specified by the user as hyperparameters.\nThe size should be smaller than the size of the input image.\nThe elements inside the filter define the filter configuration.\n\nImage section\n\nSection of the input image matrix that is multiply-summed by the kernel\nThe size of the image section should be equal to the size of the filter(s) we choose.\nWe can move the filter(s) vertically and horizontally on the input image to create different image sections.\nThe number of image sections depends on the stride we use.\n\nStride: The number of steps (pixels) that we shift the filter over the input image\n\nstride = 1 is moving the filter on the image horizontally by one step to the right (see 2nd row of images)\n\n\n\nFeature map\n\nOutput matrix from the Convolutional Operations\n\nStores the outputs of different convolution operations between different image sections and the filter(s)\nSize depends on the stride\n\nThe number of elements in the feature map is equal to the number of different image sections that we obtained by moving the filter(s) on the image.\nInput for the next pooling layer.\n\nImage Input is the input matrix\n\nPadding adds additional pixels with zero values to each side of the image which helps to keep the feature map of the same size as the input\n\nIf there are several convolutional layers in the CNN, the size of the feature map will be further reduced at the end so that we cannot do other operations on the feature map\nExample: new size of the input image is (8,8)\n\nIf we do the convolution operation now with Stride=1, we get a feature map of size (6x6) that is equal to the size of the original image before applying Padding\n\n\n\nExample: Gray Scale, Multiple Filters\n\nFeature map is now an array\n\nExample: RGB image\n\nBecause a RGB image has 3 color channels, 3-channel filters are needed to do the calculations\nfinal result (i.e. for one cell in the feature map) is obtained by adding all outputs of each channel’s convolution operation calculations\n\nExample: RGB, mulitple filters\n\nFeature map is now an array\n\n\n\nPooling layers\n\nConvolution and pooling layers are used together as pairs (i.e. one is followed by the other)\nObjectives\n\nExtract the most important (relevant) features by getting the maximum number or averaging the numbers.\nReduce the dimensionality (number of pixels) of the output returned from previous convolutional layers.\nReduce the number of parameters in the network.\nRemove any noise present in the features extracted by previous convolutional layers.\nIncrease the accuracy of CNNs.\n\nComponents and Operations (max pooling, stride = 2)\n\nThe Pooling Operation happens between a section of the feature map and the filter. It outputs the pooled feature map\n\nFor RGB, pooling operations will be done on each channel independently.\nTypes\n\nMax pooling: Get the maximum value in the feature map section where the filter is applied.\nAverage pooling: Get the average of the values in the feature map section where the filter is applied.\nglobal-average-pooling: similar to average-pooling but instead of using N×N patches of the feature maps, it uses all feature maps area at once\n\n\nFilter: empty so no transformation, it only sets the size of the image section where the pooling operation takes place\n\nSize of the filter should be specified by the user as a hyperparameter.\nSize should be smaller than the size of the feature map\nIf the feature map has multiple channels, we should use a filter with the same number of channels\n\nFeature Map: Input to the pooling layer\n\nSize of the feature map sections should be equal to the size of the filter we choose\nThe number of sections depends on the Stride\n\nPooled Feature Map: Output of the pooling layer\n\nInput for the next convolution layer (if any) or for the flatten operation.\nFor RGB, there are same number of channels in the feature map and the pooled feature map (see examples in Covolutional layers section)\n\nOther hyperparameters\n\nStride: The Stride is usually equal to the size of the filter. If the filter size is (2x2), we use Stride=2. (also see Convolutional layers section)\nPadding: Padding is applied to the feature map to adjust the size of the pooled feature map (also see Convolutional layers section)\n\nThe Flatten Operation flattens the pooled feature map output to a single column so that it can be fed the Multiayer Perceptron (MLP) and the image can be classified\n\nOccurs after the final pooling layer is completed\nUnlike flattening the original image (i.e if a MLP was used to classify an image), important pixel dependencies are retained when pooled maps are flattened.\nExample: Grayscale\nExample: RGB\n\n\n\nFully connected (dense) layers\n\nLayers of the MLP that’s used to classify the image\nInput is the flattened, pooled feature map\nThe ReLU activation is used in each fully connected layer except in the final layer in which we use the Softmax activation for multiclass classification.\n\n\nArchitectures\n\nAlexNet\n\n5 convolution layers with non-increasing kernel sizes\n\nLRN is applied on the first and second convolution layers after applying ReLU\n\n3 fully connected layers\n\nReLU activation in the hidden layers\nsoftmax activation for the output layer"

    "text": "19.3 Paper Summaries\n\nFrom pytorch-widedeep, deep learning for tabular data IV: Deep Learning vs LightGBM\n\nExperiment compared LightGBM performance vs a bunch of tabular data designed DL algorithms from pytorch-widedeep LIB (including TabNet)\n\nLightGBM destroyed them\n\n“the DL algorithm that achieves similar performance to that of LightGBM is a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)”\n“In my experience, DL models on tabular data perform best on sizeable dataset that involve many categorical features and these have many categories themselves.”\nCases where DL models can complement ML models for tabular data\n\nUsing the categorical feature embeddings from DL models as features in other models\n\nI don’t get this. This article makes it sound like they’re an artefact of the DL model itself. I just always thought this was a preprocessing step.\n\nI wonder how these are produced and extracted from the model.\n\n“the embeddings acquire a more significant value, i.e. we learn representations of those categorical features that encode relationships with all other features and also the target for a specific dataset. Note that this does not happen when using GBMs. Even if one used target encoding, in reality there is not much of a learning element there (still useful of course).”\n“Assume that you have a dataset with metadata for thousands of brands and prices for their corresponding products. Your task is to predict how the price changes over time (i.e. forecasting price). The embeddings for the categorical feature brand will give you information about how a particular brand relates to the rest of the columns in the dataset and the target (price). In other words, if given a brand you find the closest brands as defined by embeddings proximity you would be”naturally” and directly finding competitors within a given space (assuming that the dataset is representative of the market).”\n\nImprove performance on a small dataset by “transferring”(?) whats learned from using a DL model on a similar much larger dataset\n\nThe transferring comes from Transfer learning which I have no idea how it works.\n“Assume you have a large dataset for a given problem in one country but a much smaller dataset for the exact same problem in another country. Let’s also assume that the datasets are, column-wise, rather similar. One could train a DL model using the large dataset and”transfer the learnings” to the second, much smaller dataset with the hope of obtaining a much higher performance than just using that small dataset alone.”\n\n\n\n(Raschka summary) On Embeddings for Numerical Features in Tabular Deep Learning (paper, code)\n\nInstead of designing new architectures for end-to-end learning, the authors focus on embedding methods for tabular data: (1) a piecewise linear encoding of scalar values and (2) periodic activation-based embeddings. Experiments show that the embeddings are not only beneficial for transformers but other methods as well – multilayer perceptrons are competitive to transformers when trained on the proposed embeddings.\nUsing the proposed embeddings, ResNet, multilayer perceptrons, and transformers outperform CatBoost and XGBoost on several (but not all) datasets.\nSmall caveat: I would have liked to see a control experiment where the authors trained CatBoost and XGboost on the proposed embeddings.\n\n  (Raschka summary) Why do tree-based models still outperform deep learning on tabular data? (paper)\n\nThe main takeaway is that tree-based models (random forests and XGBoost) outperform deep learning methods for tabular data on medium-sized datasets (10k training examples). The gap between tree-based models and deep learning becomes narrower as the dataset size increases (here: 10k -&gt; 50k).\nSolid experiments and thorough investigation into the role of uninformative features: uninformative features harm deep learning methods more than tree-based methods.\nSmall caveats: some of the recent tabular methods for deep learning were not considered; “large” datasets are only 50k training examples (small in many industry domains.)\nExperiments based on 45 tabular datasets; numerical and mixed numerical-categorical; classification and regression datasets; 10k training examples with balanced classes for main experiments; 50k datasets for “large” dataset experiments."

The container is running for some time and then being stopped for some reason.\n\nclick task id\n\nlogs tab – select container\n\nshows errors that have occurred\n\nDetails tab\n\nContainers (bottom)\n\nclick expand-arrow on desired container\n\nclick view logs in CloudWatch\n\ntakes you to CloudWatch console\n\nview the logs of the task\n\nable to filter log by events\n\ngo up one level to see log streams\n\ncan match containers and tasks to see if it might be a task issue\nend hash is the task id\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails tab\n\nLoad Balancing – click target group name\n\ntargets tab\n\nshows the individual targets (ip addresses), ports, statuses\nstatus by region (if you have resources in different zones)\n\nexample: there were 2 zones -  us.east.2a and 2b and one had all healthy and the other had zero healthy, but he didn’t mention anything about it. Think that’s just how nodes are taken on and offline and not that there’s a regional issue.\n\n\nhealth checks tab\n\nhealthy threshold\n\nnumber of code 200s i.e. healthy responses required in order for a node to be considered healthy\n\nunhealthy threshold\n\nnumber of code 300s i.e. error responses required in order for the node to be considered unhealthy\n\n\n\n\nLogs tab\n\nshows the aggregate of the logs for each container (all tasks included)\nselect a container from the dropdown\n\ntimestamp, message, task id\nexample: shows a “bind” error that says the container can’t a bind to port 80 because it’s already in use.  In the Update task definition to share data volumes section, the second container he added was a duplicate of the nginx container and both were trying to bind to port 80. Hence the error\n\n\n\n\nCluster metrics\n\nClusters – EC2 cluster – metrics tab\n\nonly useful for EC2 clusters\ncompute and memory resources being used\n\nshows time series of min, max, and average percent usage\n\n\nClusters – fargate cluster – services tab\n\nclick service name – metrics tab\n\nsame stuff as EC2 metrics tab\ncan click on the different metrics (cpu, memory utilization) and create custom metric functions, change period length, etc.\n\nleft panel has alarms (autoscaling trigger history), events, logs, and settings"

A combination of a file system and parameters. A package that rolls up everything you need to run an application.\n\nComposed of stacked layers where the layers are self-contained files\nYou can download, build, and run image, but they cannot be changed (immutable)\n\nYou can have many running containers of the same image.\nDocker Hub is a registry for docker repositories. It’s like a github for images. Each repo has 1 image but the repo can store many tagged versions of that image (version control)\nPull and run a docker image from Docker Hub from local cli\n\ndocker run url/repo/image\n\nexample: docker run docker.io/library/hello-world\n\ndocker.io = docker hub\nlibrary = repo name for all “official” images\nhello-world = name of image\n\n\n\nTwo ways to create a image\n\nWhile inside a container, make changes. Then use commit command to create the new image with the changes\n\nNever used. Creating a dockerfile is superior.\n\nUsing a dockerfile\n\nimages on docker hub\n\nmdancho/h2o-verse\n\nh20, tidyverse, tensorflow, keras \n~2 GB\n\n\n\nCreating a dockerfile (example of a toy python flask app)\n\nArchitecture \n\nstart with FROM base:tag\n\nEssentially copy-pastes the base image\nusually good to start with a base image\n\nFROM python:2.7-alpine\n\npython is the base image and 2.7-alpine is the tag\n\n\n\nRUN executes commands or scripts as if you were in the container’s OS\n\nRUN mkdir /app\n\nmakes a directory called “app”\n\n\nWORKDIR sets the working directory for everything that happens after this command\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY has source path+file (local) and a destination path+file (container) as args\n\nCOPY requirements.txt requirements.txt\n\nthe first requirements.txt is in the same dir as the docker file so no “/other-dir/” required\nthe second “requirements.txt” says the file is to be placed into the /app dir\n\nequivalent to “/app/requirements.txt” because /app is our working directory\n\n\nCannot use .. to move above the dockerfile directory. Every path must be below it.\n\nInstall packages\n\nRUN pip -install  -r requirements.txt\n\ninside requirements.txt says Flask==0.12\n\n\nCopy entire local directory to the working directory\n\nCOPY . .\n\nfirst period says copy everything is the current local directory\nsecond period says put everything in the working dir\n\n\nLABELs have key-value pairs. can be useful in production settings. The can be retrieved with a command later on. \n\nSome uses:\n\nfilter a container’s output based on a label  \ncan include scripts for automatic load balancing (also see aws load balancer section below)\n\nLABEL maintainer=“Eric Book ericbook@email.com”\\\n\n\n\n\n                         version=“1.0”    \n\nOften changed or added to, so they should be close to the end of the dockerfile (but not the last line)\nCMD gives the default instruction when the image gets ran which is different from RUN commands, which are executed when the image is built.\n\nCMD flask run –host=0.0.0.0 –port=5000\nUnder-the-hood: CMD instructions are arguments to an entrypoint script and get run through a default docker entrypoint (see waaaaay below for info about entrypoints)\n\nA \\\\ is Linux operator that chains together instructions so they can be in separate lines of code for easier reading. Think a space also does the same thing, but you can’t see it in the code.\nThe ordering of the inputs in the dockerfile will affect its size and efficiency\n\nThe source code is much more likely to change in the future than the package dependencies. Therefore even though there would be fewer COPY commands, it’s best to install the dependencies before copying the source code.\nWhenever changes to the source code occur Docker has a caching mechanism, so that it doesn’t rebuild everything above the layer where the changes occur. COPY . . executes in millisecs so the rebuild happens almost instantly while installing dependencies could take minutes.\n\nAttaching packages and libraries\n\nDownload and install R packages\n\nRUN R -e “install.packages(c(‘shinydashboard’, ‘reticulate’, ‘shiny’))”\n\nDownload, install Python libraries (ubuntu image)\n\nRUN ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python && \\\n\n\n\n                                                               ln -s /usr/bin/pip3 /usr/bin/pip    \n\nRUN apt-get update\nRUN apt-get install -y libpython-dev\nRUN apt-get install -y libpython3-dev\nImages\n\nBuild image from dockerfile (** don’t forget the dot at the end **)\n\ndocker image build -t web1 .\n\nimage is the management command\nbuild is the sub-command of image\n-t is the flag for “tag”\nweb1 is the tag. This allows us to to refer to this image as “web1” instead of a hash\n. says build the image and place in current directory\n\nEnd of build shows hash id “successfully built ”\ndocker image build -t web1:1.0\n\nversioning the image\nfor just “web1” the version will be web1:latest\n\n\nInspect the image\n\ndocker image inspect web1\ninfo in json format\nAt the top complete hash id\nshows the versions of the image under “repotag”\nvarious info about how the layers were created\nthe number of layers created is shown at the bottom by the lines preceded by a “sha” and a hash\n\nList of images in local docker host\n\ndocker image ls\n\nbase images loaded from dockerfiles listed alongside the images we create\n images are “dangling images.” They are failed image builds or images that were built on top of already existing images\n\nsafe to delete; frees up disk space\n\n\n\nDelete local image\n\nUsing name and version tag\n\ndocker image rm web1:1.0\n\nUsing id\n\ndocker image rm -f 633f\n\n-f is the “force” flag\n\nnecessary when image has been tagged/copied (like when pushing to docker hub) and you want to remove both images.\n\n633f - only need the first four characters of the hash id\n\nids in docker image ls\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker Hub\n\nLogin to Docker Hub\n\nHave to do it once then a config file is created so you don’t have to do it again\nInput your username and password for your Docker Hub acct\ndocker login\n\nPush image to Docker Hub\n\nTag image with docker hub username\n\ndocker image tag web1 ercbk/web1:latest\n\nweb1 is the image we want to push\nercbk/web1:latest\n\nercbk is the username\nweb1 is the repo\nlatest is the tag\n\n\ndocker image ls will show the newly tagged image\n\nPush image to docker hub\n\ndocker image push ercbk/web1:latest\n\n\n\nRunning Containers\n\n** Unless you include -d in the run command, you will need to open a separate terminal (i.e. different from the one you ran the run command in) in order run more docker cli commands while an app is running **\n** container names and ports need to be unique for each running container **\ndocker container ls\n\nlists all running containers, container_id, image, creation time, runtime, name\n-a\n\nshows all stopped containers\n\n\ndocker container rm &lt;name&gt;\n\ndeletes a stopped container\ncan also use 1st four characters of &lt;container_id&gt;\n\nshown in ls (see above)\n\n\ndocker container run\n\nthe basic run command\nhardly ever want to use just the basic commmand\n\nsee flags and examples below\n\n\ndocker container stop &lt;name&gt;\n\nstops a container\nadd more s to stop more than one container\n\nwith spaces between the names\n\nalso, ctrl + c\n\nuse it in the same terminal you used the run command in.\nonly works if you included the -it flag when you started it.\n\nalso see –rm below\ndocker container stop $( docker container ls -q)\n\nStops all running containers\n-q flag says list them quietly, so it doesn’t print them out\nif you a “stop requires at least one argument” error, then there aren’t any containers running\n\n\ndocker container logs &lt;name&gt;\n\ncan also use 1st four characters of &lt;container_id&gt;\nfor active or inactive containers\nshows times container was accessed\n-f\n\nruns log in the foreground (i.e. you can view accesses in real-time)\nctrl + c to kill it\n\n\ndocker container stats\n\nreal-time monitoring of active containers\nshows cpu and memory usage for each container\nnetwork input/output\n\nflags\n\n** Don’t think order matters except for that the name of the image needs to be last **\n-d\n\nruns the container in the background\nallows you to run commands in the same terminal window that you used the container run command in\n\n-e\n\nallows you to pass an environment variable into the container\nNot always necessary\n\nFlask requires one (e.g. -e FLASK_APP=app.py)\n\napp.py is the name of the app script\n\n\nmultiple -e flags are allowed\n\n-e FLASK_DEBUG=1\n\nturns debug mode on when you run the container\nuse along with -v to make real-time changes to the app while the container is running\n\n\n\n-it\n\nallows for unix commands such as ctrl c to kill a process (such as a running container)\nmakes the docker container interactive. Which allows you to go into the container, navigate the file system, and make changes.\n\n--name\n\ndocker automatically provide a name for a container but this flag allows you to provide your own\n--name moose\n\n-p \n\nports\n\nmap ports from local machine to ports within docker\n\nexpected to supply two ports separated by a colon\n-p 5000:5000\n\nThe first 5000 is the host port. The port you use to interact with the app in your browser (e.g. localhost:5000)\n\nAll containers running on your docker host need to have unique ports to run on. (e.g. -p 5001:8000)\nSo, I think this can be any port you want as long something else isn’t already using it.\n\nThe second 5000 is the container port that was specified in the dockerfile\n\nTried 5000:5000 and the app didn’t run in the browser even when the dockerfile had 5000 specified, but after specifying 800 in the dockerfile, -p 5000:8000 did work\n\nThis was run on the default docker network\n\nRunning -p 5000:5000 DID work on a custom network.\n\nAlso these are 2 different apps. The 1st one was stand-alone (03-lecture cloud guru docker fundamentals), and the 2nd ran in conjunction with a redis server (see custom network section below)(09-lecture in cloud guru docker fundamentals). Not sure if that makes a difference\n\n\n\nWhen running the container, if it’s an app, it can be viewed in a browser at localhost:5000 (i.e. the first port specified)\n-p 5000\n\ndocker will attach a random port number\n\nYou can specify more than one port mapping e.g. -p 5000:5000 -p 3838:3838\nports (second port specified) for common images\n\nredis (storage) - 6379\nnginx (web server) - 80\n\nopen source, handles a lot of connections efficiently, used to host a lot of websites\n\nRStudio: -p 3838:3838\nShiny apps launched from within RStudio: -p 8787:8787\n\n\n--restart\n\nwith value, on-failure\n\nsays restart the container if there’s some catastrophic failure (e.g. docker daemon dies and restarts)\nuseful in production\n\ncannot be included if –rm is also used\n\n--rm\n\ndeletes the container once it has been stopped\ncannot be included if –restart is also used\n\n-v\n\nvolumes\nUse cases\n\nwhile developing. Makes changes inside the container in real-time.\nstore data in a db\nMapping to a folder on your local machine allows you to work on projects stored within the container\n\n(1st half) requires address (local machine) to the directory with the script (e.g. app script not dockerfile) where you’re making changes  (2nd half) address inside the container where this directory should be “mounted” (i.e. where the script you’re making changes to is located inside the container)\n\n1st half\n\nFor Linux, you can used the shortcut, “$PWD” which is a linux environment variable that stores the path to the working directory. It has the same value as the command “pwd -L” which Prints Working Directory.\n\nfyi the -L has something to do with “symlinks” which are thinks that can be created that point to another directory. If you’re in in the symlink directory -L will print that directory and -P will print the directory that the symlink points to.\nsame thing for Mac, except the quotes might need to be included\n\nFor windows, “/c/users/&lt;user_name&gt;/path/to/directory”\n\n2nd half\n\n“/app” which is where the app script is (also the working directory specified in the dockerfile for the example)\n\nExample in Linux, docker container run -it -p 5000:5000 -e FLASK\\_APP=app.py --rm -name web1 -e FLASK\\_DEBUG=1 -v $PWD:/app web1\nExample in Windows, docker container run --rm -itd -p 5000:5000 -e FLASK\\_APP=1 -e FLASK\\_DEBUG=1 --name web2 -v /C/Users/tbats/Documents/R/Projects/Docker/Courses/cloud-guru-docker-fund/09-linking-containers-with-docker-networks:/app web2\n\nWhile running, if you open a new terminal and docker container inspect &lt;name&gt;, then there should be a “mount” section with type = “bind”\nTroubleshooting if changes don’t show up in the container in real-time\n\nit’s probably the path specifications for the value of the -v tag. Docker is picky, esp w/WIndows.\nMake sure code script and docker are on same drive\nNext try replacing Alpine Linux with Slim Linux in the dockerfile –&gt; rebuild image –&gt; run container with volume flag + the addresses like stated above\n\nSomething about inotify in Alpine not doing something\n\nsee exec command below\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\ndocker container run -it -p 5000:8000 -e FLASK\\_APP=app.py web1\n\nweb1 is the name of the image.\nThis is probably least number of flags necessary to run an app in a container\n\ndocker container run -it --rm --name web2 -p 5000:8000 -e FLASK\\_APP=app.py -d --restart on-failure web2\n\nexec\n\nexecutes an interactive bash session in the container\nContainer must be running, so open a new terminal window and type the code line:\n\ndocker container exec -it web1 bash\n\nwhere web1 in the name of the container\nbash is for the Slim distribution of Linux; use sh for Alpine\n\nOr run a bash command detached in the background docker exec -t -d web1 bash \"ls -al\"\n\nyou’ll be logged in under “root” and dropped into wherever you designated the working directory in the dockerfile\nType ls -la to view the files\nExample of a debug\n\nPython app isn’t showing changes after running it with a volume flag (-v)\nyou exec a bash session inside the container\ndelete some .pyc files (might be corrupted somehow) that are created when python runs flask\n\nrm *.pyc\nls -la to confirm\n\ngo to local script and make changes, save\ngo to terminal window where container is running and see changes to scripts detected in the terminal\ngo to browser where app is running and refresh\nwait a few secs and changes show up. Yay.\ngo back to bash terminal window, ctrl + d to kill it\n\n\n\nNetworking Containers\n\nInternal networks (LANs), external networks (WAN)\n\nWAN is a wide area network. Can be public or private. Stretches across city or industrial park, etc\n\nAccess addresses\n\nservers bound to 0.0.0.0: give access to any computers on your LAN or WAN\nif localhost:, then only laptop running the server can connect to it\nif : then any computer on your LAN, WAN, or on the internet can connect\n\ne.g. 192.168.1.4:5000\n\n\nList of Docker networks\n\ndocker network ls\nipconfig (windows) ifconfig (Linux, Mac)\n\nshows info about networks\n\nbridge network is docker0 which is the docker supplied network\n\nfyi docker0 didn’t show up on Windows for me\n\n\nPing from one container to another\n\nNote: ping and ifconfig removed from Alpine and Slim image\n\nto reinstall, add this to 2nd line of dockerfile\n\nAlpine\n\nRUN apk update && apk add iputils\n\nSlim\n\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y net-tools iputils-ping\n\n\n\ndocker exec web2 ping 172.17.0.2\n\nwhere 172.17.0.2 is the other container’s eth0 inet address\n\nfound by docker exec &lt;container name&gt; ifconfig\n\n\nctrl + c to stop the pinging\n\nView etc file\n\ndocker exec &lt;container name&gt; cat /etc/hosts\nshows eth0 inet address is mapped to container id\n\nCreate custom network\n\nallows us to connect containers by name which means if the addresses change, the apps won’t break.\ndocker network create --driver bridge &lt;name&gt;\n\nthe bridge driver is used for networking containers on the same docker host\nfor networking across multiple docker hosts, the overlay driver is used. (would need to research this further)\n\nInspect network\n\ndocker network inspect &lt;name&gt;\n\nadd container to custom network\n\nadd –net  to the run-container instruction\n\nexample: docker container run -it --rm name web2 -p 5000:5000 -e FLASK\\_APP=app.py -d --net firstnetwork web2\nexample: docker container run -it --rm name redis -p 6379:6379 -d --net firstnetwork redis:3.2-alpine\n\nThis containers only linked up with the app running on the browser when they were run on the custom network and not the default docker bridge network\nin debug mode: docker container run -it --name web2 -p 5000:5000 -e FLASK\\_APP=app.py -e FLASK\\_DEBUG=1 -v /C/Users/tbats/Documents/R/Projects/Docker/Courses/cloud-guru-docker-fund/09-linking-containers-with-docker-networks:/app -d --rm --net firstnetwork web2\n\ncontainers will show up when you inspect firstnetwork\ncan now ping using container names (assuming both containers have been added to the network)\n\ndocker exec web2 ping redis\n\nweb2 is the container doing the pinging\nredis being pinged \n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Volumes\n\nallows data to persist on docker host after the container is stopped\n\nShould save on the host for apps because they should be portable\nFor databases, not so bad\n\nA volume is nothing more than a folder on your computer that is linked to a folder inside the Docker container.\nDefault volume path on host, “/var/lib/docker/volume/”\ndocker volume create web2\\_redis\n\nweb2_redis is the name of the volume\n\ngood idea to pick a name that’s relevant to job\n\n\ndocker volume ls\n\nlist of volumes\n\ndocker volume inspect web2\\_redis\n\nshows info about volume\n“Mountpoint” shows where the volume will be stored on the host machine\n\ndocker volume rm &lt;volume1 name&gt; &lt;volume2 name&gt;\n\nremove specific volumes by name\n\ndocker volume prune\n\nremoves all volumes\n\ndocker rm -v &lt;container name&gt;\n\nremoves container and anonymous volume\n\nWill not remove a named volume\n\n-v required else a “dangling” is created\n\ndocker volume ls -qf dangling=true docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)\n\nremoves dangling volumes\n\nAdd volume flag, data volume name, and destination to container\n\ndocker container run -it --rm name redis -p 6379:6379 -d --net firstnetwork -v web2\\_redis:/data  redis:3.2-alpine\n\nweb2_redis is the name we gave to the data volume\n/data is designated by the redis people\n\nThis technique works for mysql, postgres, elasticsearch, etc. You just have to figure out the WHERE they decided that they want you to store your data (i.e. the /data part)\n\ngo to their docker hub image page –&gt; view readme –&gt; look for section on persistent storage\nExample I went to postgres page and did an ctrl+f “persistent” and found a section describing when to use /data or /pgdata\n\n\n\n\nSaving the data\n\nredis does it automatically every 30 sec\nManual save if you need to save right away:\n\ndocker exec redis redis-cli SAVE\n\n\nExample: Named Volume\n\n\n            version: '3.8'\n            services:\n              db:\n                image: mysql\n                restart: always\n                environment:\n                  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root\n                  MYSQL_DATABASE: test_db\n                ports:\n                  - \"3306:3306\"\n                volumes:\n                  - db_data:/var/lib/mysql\n            volumes:\n              db_data:\n\n“db_data” is the name\n“/var/lib/mysql” is the path inside the container\nAdvantages\n\nData persists after we restart or remove a container\nAccessible by other containers\n\nExample: Unnamed (aka Anonymous) Volume\n\n            version: '3.8'\n            services:\n              db:\n                image: mysql\n                restart: always\n                environment:\n                  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root\n                  MYSQL_DATABASE: test_db\n                ports:\n                  - \"3306:3306\"\n                volumes:\n                  - /var/lib/mysql\n\nNo volume name here but still has the path inside the container\nData will persist on restart of the container, but not after the container is stopped and removed\nNot accessible by other containers\nActually… even without the “volumes” instruction, the “mysql” image/dockerfile has a “VOLUME” instruction, so an anonymous volume would still be created.\nExample (Bind Mounts)\n\n            version: '3.8'\n            services:\n              db:\n                image: mysql\n                restart: always\n                environment:\n                  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root\n                  MYSQL_DATABASE: test_db\n                ports:\n                  - \"3306:3306\"\n                volumes:\n                  - $PWD/data:/var/lib/mysql\n\nInstead of using the default host directory for the volume, you can specify a location yourself\nfirst half (before colon) : where on the host machine to mount (i.e. create) the volume\n\nIn the example, it’s located in the working directory + /data\nFor Linux, you can used the shortcut, “$PWD” which is a linux environment variable that stores the path to the working directory. It has the same value as the command “pwd -L” which Prints Working Directory.\n\nfyi the -L has something to do with “symlinks” which are thinks that can be created that point to another directory. If you’re in in the symlink directory -L will print that directory and -P will print the directory that the symlink points to.\nsame thing for Mac, except the quotes might need to be included\n\nFor windows, “/c/users/&lt;user_name&gt;/path/to/directory”\n\nsecond half (after colon): specify the path inside the container you want to use for the volume. Usually specified by the db software.\n\nIn the example, it’s “/var/lib/mysql” which has been specified by the mysql image\n\nSharing data between containers\n\nContainers sharing and receiving need to be on the same docker host\nAdd to app dockerfile\n\nVOLUME [“/app/public”]\n\nLine location in the dockerfile wasn’t specified but he put his right before the CMD line\nlocal directory with app has a folder named “public” that will be shared with other containers.\n\n\nSteps\n\nbuild app image\nrun app image\nrun redis image with flags, –volume -from  \n\ndocker container run -it --rm name redis -p 6379:6379 -d --net firstnetwork -v web2\\_redis:/data --volume -from web2  redis:3.2-alpine\n\n\nFiles in app’s public folder will be in redis’s container\n\nSteps\n\ngo into redis container\n\ndocker container exec -it redis sh\n\nchange directory to the public folder\n\ncd /app/public\n\ncontents of app’s public folder are in this folder too\n\nexamine contents by printing to the terminal\n\ncat main.css\n\n\n\n\nWhile containers are running, you can exec into volume container (e.g. web2) add files, make changes to files, etc., and the files in the other containers will be updated in real time.\nAlternate method (*not recommended for production*)\n\nDon’t put the VOLUME instruction in the dockerfile\nAdd -v /app/public to the app run command\nAdd the –volume -from flags to the redis container run command like before\n\n\nOptimizing container file size\n\n.dockerignore\n\nContains file paths to files in the local project directory that you don’t want on the image (e.g. files with private data, .git files can be huge)\nDuring the image build, when docker runs the COPY/ADD instructions it will bypass the files in the .dockerignore file\nFile paths in the .dockerignore file begin wherever you’ve designated the working directory in WORKDIR in the dockerfile\nExamples:\n\n.git/\n\nadding a trailing “/” isn’t necessary but lets people know it’s a directory and not a file\n\nmay want to include the .dockerignore itself\nfolder/*\n\nThe folder itself will be added to the image but all the content will be ignored\n\n**/*.txt\n\nsays ignore all files with the .txt extension\n\n!name.txt\n\nthis grants an exception to the name.txt file. It will be added to the image even with the **/*.txt\n\nYou can negate the .dockerignore file\n\nJust a * on line 1\nbegin each file path with a “!” to specify which files to include\n\n\n\nRemoving the build dependency files of the system dependency files (** only for Alpine Linux **)\n\nIn other words the files used to build the system dependency files\nHe uses the example of a postgres dependency in the video, but no dependencies are actually listed in the dockerfile in the files folder.\n\n2 hypotheses on what he’s talking about:\n\nThe package you use in python to interact with the sql db has dependencies and files are needed to build those dependencies (build dependencies). After the dependencies are built, the build dependencies get deleted.\nThis image with include the sql db and that db has build dependencies. They get deleted\n\nI think it’s 1., but I dunno. In the Installing packages section above, there are examples of python-dev files being installed, but I’m not sure which hypothesis that favors.\n\n\n\nIt’s a bear of a bash script, so see dockerfile for details in cloud guru docker fund course, 012 lecture files folder on optimizing\n\nscript stays above the COPY . . instruction\nIf you use this script, thoroughly check everything and make sure the packages are working as intended.\n\nSteps\n\nfirst line (indent of the lines is the same in the file)\n\n\n\n\nRUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps \\\n\nsecond line, add dependencies\n\n    postgressql-dev dependency2 dependency3 \\\n\nThen add the rest of the bash gunk\n\n    && pip install -r requirements.txt \\\n    && find /usr/local \\\n        \\( -type d -a -name test -o -name tests \\) \\\n        -o \\( -type f -a -name '*.pyc' -o -name '*.pyo' \\) \\\n        -exec rm -rf '{}' + \\\n    && runDeps=\"$( \\\n        scanelf --needed --nobanner --recursive /usr/local \\\n                | awk '{ gsub(/,/, \"\\nso:\", $2); print \"so:\" $2 }' \\\n                | sort -u \\\n                | xargs -r apk info --installed \\\n                | sort -u \\\n    )\" \\\n    && apk add --virtual .rundeps $runDeps \\\n    && apk del .build-deps\n\nRunning scripts when a container starts\n\nInstead of making multiple similar dockerfiles/images, you can use entry points into one dockerfile/image\n\nExamples:\n\nFor a postgressql image, you pass a run instruction inside the dockerfile that sets up your user authorization and password as an environment variable. It also has an ENTRYPOINT, so that if you have other projects that use a postgres sql db, they can gain access to that information through the entry point.\nRunning a db migration after a container starts\n\nrun_db_migration1 as environment variable but with a default value set to off. You can control that action through entrypoint and a script\n\ncontrol stuff in a nginx config to set an external ip after the container is running\n\n\nThe docker_entrypoint scripts aren’t in your dockerfile so they don’t add layers to an image\nSteps\n\nAdd lines to dockerfile\n\n\n\n                    COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /\n\ndocker-entrypoint.sh should be a file in the root project directory\n\nNot in app directory, because it’s best practice to keep entrypoint files separate.\nFor details see section below\n\n\n                    RUN chmod +x /docker-entrypoint.sh\n\ntells Linux to give the entrypoint script permission to run\n\n                    ENTRYPOINT [\"/docker-entrypoint.sh\"]\n\nentry point instruction that points to where the script is located.\nRun redis container as before\nBuild app image as before (gave it the name, “webentrypoint”)\nRun app container\n\ndocker container run -it --name webentrypoint -p 5000:5000 -e FLASK_APP=app.py -e FLASK_DEBUG=1 --rm --net firstnetwork webentrypoint\n\nname and image values changed to webentrypoint\nremoved -d flag because we want it to run in the foreground\nIf you go to localhost:5000 it has some message printed from the docker-entrypoint.sh script\nStop the app container\nRe-run the app container\n\ndocker container run -it --name webentrypoint -p 5000:5000 -e FLASK_APP=app.py -e FLASK_DEBUG=1 -e WEB2_COUNTER_MSG=\"Docker fans will have visited this page\" --rm --net firstnetwork webentrypoint\n\nWEB2_COUNTER_MSG is an environment variable that was given a default value inside the docker-entrypoint.sh script.\nSo we were able to change the environment variable without having to run the container, exec into the container, then change it.\nDetails on the dockerentrypoint.sh file\n\nWhen you run the container, this script gets run before the dockerfile\nExports an environment variable that gets accessed by the app.py script\n\n\n                    #!/bin/sh\n\nComment that tells us that we’re running a shell script\n\n                    set -e\n\nsays abort if there’s an error in the script\n\n                    echo \"The Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT has been executed!\"\n\nLine that prints in the terminal when we run the container\n\n                    export WEB2_COUNTER_MSG=\"${WEB2_COUNTER_MSG:-carbon based life forms have sensed this website}\"\n\nWhere the custom scripting takes place\nIn this case, WEB2_COUNTER_MSG environment variable is created and a default value set\n\nI think the syntax after the = has something to do with making the value a default value\n\n\n                    exec \"$@\"\n\nSays that after running everything in this script, then run the CMD stuff in the dockerfile\nDocker utility functions (can be run in any directory)\n\ndocker system df\n\nshows resources being used by docker\nadding -v tag at the end, produces a verbose output all the info is broken down further\n\ndocker system info\n\ninfo about your docker installation\n\nuseful when reporting bugs, creating issues\nverify docker installation\n\n\ndocker system prune\n\ndeletes all the crud\n\nstopped containers that you forgot to include –rm\nvolumes not used by at least one container\nnetworks not used by at least one container\nall dangling images\n\nadd -f flag to execute the prune without the confirmation message\n\nuseful for automating through cron jobs, etc.\n\nadd -a flag to remove ALL unused images\n\n**only run if want every image not being used by a running container to be deleted**\n\n\n\nDocker Compose (note dash between docker and compose in commands)\n\ndocker-compose.yml properties\n\nyaml files do not need to be in the same directory as your dockerfiles.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk itself uses EC2 instances for running your application and S3 storage for storing data, but you as a user don’t have to bother with these things. You can simply upload your Docker image and AWS Elastic Beanstalk handles the remaining stuff for you.\n\nA “docker-compose.yml” file is used by AWS Elastic Beanstalk to create and run the Docker container and has to be placed in the same directory as the Dockerfile\n\n\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  deploy:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile\n    ports:\n      - '80:5000'\n\nport 80 is mapped to the port 5000 of the container.

The predicted response for a Random Utility Model.\nChoice Settings - Can describe in general the choice set itself, or can also be used to describe the context in which the choice by the decision-maker is taking place.\n\ne.g. binary, ordered multinomial, unordered multinomial, and count data frameworks\ne.g. educational setting, marketing setting\ne.g. costs associated with each alternative for each individual\n\nConsumer Surplus - Monetary gain to a consumer from “purchasing” a good for less than the value the consumer places on the good\nCost Trade-Offs - How changes in one in a choice attribute can be offset by another.\n\ne.g. If the operating cost were to increase by $1, what reduction the purchase price would result in the same utility/choice probability for the consumer.\n\nDiscounted Utility - The utility of some future event, such as consuming a certain amount of a good, as perceived at the present time as opposed to at the time of its occurrence. It is calculated as the present discounted value of future utility, and for people with time preference for sooner rather than later gratification, it is less than the future utility.\nMarginal Utility - Coefficients in the logit model (log odds ratios). The added satisfaction that a consumer gets from having one more unit of a good or service. The concept of marginal utility is used by economists to determine how much of an item consumers are willing to purchase.\nMarket Level - Environment or category where a class or brand of products share the same attributes\n\ne.g. All Cokes should cost the same in Indianapolis but that price may be different from the price of Cokes in Nashville. Therefore, Indianapolis and Nashville are separate markets.\n\nMarket Share - The percentage of total sales in an industry or product category that belong to a particular company during a discrete period of time. For a Random Utility Model, when the data is at the market level instead of the individual level, the predicted response is the Market Share.\nOutside Product (aka Outside Option) - Typically a “purchase nothing” indicator variable/variable category\n\nCan just be a vector of 0s\n\nRandom Utility Models - These models rely on the hypothesis that the decision maker is able to rank the different alternatives by an order of preference represented by a utility function, the chosen alternative being the one which is associated with the highest level of utility. They are called random utility models because part of the utility is unobserved and is modeled as the realization of a random deviate."

    "text": "Random Utility Models\n\nMisc\nRandom Utility - utility theory can readily be understood as the idea that people behave in line with self-interset where self-interest reflects peoples’ needs to save time and economize on effort.\n\nThese models rely on the hypothesis that the decision maker is able to rank the different alternatives by an order of preference represented by a utility function, the chosen alternative being the one which is associated with the highest level of utility. They are called random utility models because part of the utility is unobserved and is modeled as the realization of a random deviate.\n\nData sets used to estimate random utility models have therefore a specific structure that can be characterized by three indexes: the alternative, the choice situation, and the individual. The distinction between choice situation and individual indexes is only relevant if we have repeated observations for the same individual.\n\nExamples of variable types\n\nData Descriptions\n\nEach individual has responded to several (up to 16) scenarios.\nFor every scenario, two train tickets A and B are proposed to the user, with different combinations of four attributes: price (the price in cents of guilders), time (travel time in minutes), change (the number of changes) and comfort (the class of comfort, 0, 1 or 2, 0 being the most comfortable class).\n\nChoice Situation Specific\n\ndata1: Length of the vacation and the Season\ndata2: values of dist, income and urban are repeated four times.\n\ndist (the distance of the trip)\nincome (household income)\nurban (a dummy for trips which have a large city at the origin or the destination)\nnoalt the number of available alternatives\n\n\nIndividual Specific\n\ndata1: Income and Family Size\ndata2: None\n\nAlternative Specific\n\ndata1: Distance to Destination and Cost\ndata2:\n\ntransport modes (air, train, bus and car)\ncost for monetary cost\nivt for in vehicle time\novt for out of vehicle time\nfreq for frequency\n\n\n\nThe unit of observation is typically the choice situation, and it is also the individual if there is only one choice situation per individual observed, which is often the case\n\nAgent/Decison-Maker gets some amount of utility from each of the alternatives (set of actions the user can choose from)\nThe amount of utility for each alternative and each decision maker can depend on:\n\nobserved characteristics of the alternative themselves\nobserved characteristics of the decision maker\nunobserved characteristics\n\nUtility is not observed but can be inferred by factors that are observed (and how each factor affects Utility):\n\nChosen alternative, i, by each decision maker, n\nSome attributes about each alternative\nSome attributes about each decision maker.\n\nTotal Utility: \\(U_{nj} = V_{nj} + \\epsilon_{nj}\\)\n\nWhere Representative (or Observed) Utility, \\(V_{nj} = V(x_{nj}, s_n)\\)\n\n\\(x_{nj}\\) is the vector of attributes for alternative j specific to decison maker n\n\\(s_n\\) is the vector of attributes for decision maker n\\\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{nj}\\) is called the “Random Utility” which is unobserved (i.e. the stuff we didn’t adjust for).\n\nUtility Model: \\(U_{nj} = \\hat{\\beta}x_{nj} + \\epsilon_{nj}\\)\n\n\\(V_j = \\hat{\\beta} \\boldsymbol{x}\\)\nSince \\(U_{nj}\\) is unobserved, decision maker choice from alternatives is used as the response variable to proxy Utility.\n\\(\\beta\\) is called a “structural parameter”\n\nChoice Probabilities\n\\[\nP_{ni} = \\int_{\\epsilon} \\mathbb{1} (\\epsilon_{nj} - \\epsilon_{ni} &lt; V_{ni} - V_{nj} \\;\\; \\forall j \\neq i) f(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_n) d \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_n\n\\]\n\nAssuming the decision maker makes choices that maximize utility allows us to use choice probabilities to model which alternative maximizes utility.\nSee video for the derivation from \\(\\text{PR}(U_{ni} &gt; U_{nj} \\;\\; \\forall j \\neq i)\\)\nThis is the cumulative distribution for \\(\\epsilon_{nj} - \\epsilon_{ni}\\) which is a multidimensional integral over the density of unobserved utility, \\(f(\\epsilon_n)\\).\nAssumptions about \\(f(\\epsilon_n)\\) are what yields different discrete choice models"

Therefore the blue bus and the red bus have the same choice probability: \\(P_{bb} = P_{rb}\\)\nBut from the IIA property, the ratio of choice probability between car and blue bus is not changed after introduction of the red bus. Therefore, \\(P_c = P_{bb} = P_{rb} = 1/3\\)\nIn reality, the choice probability for car has NOT decreased, since for decision maker, the choice is actually between car and bus — color isn’t a relative factor\n\nExample: Hummer, Escalade, Prius\n\nHummer lowers price.\nWill Hummer attract more Escalade drivers than Prius?\nThe logit model says that “proportional substitution to the Hummer will be equal for the Escalade and the Prius.\n\ni.e. The lowering of the Hummer price will have an equal effect on Escalade sales and Prius sales which is unrealistic\n\n\n\nProportional Substitution\n\nNote the logit cross-elasticity equation for alternative, i, given a change in alternative, j (See below, Elasticity &gt;&gt; Cross Elasticity). The change in choice probability for alternative i only depends on the change to the attribute for alternative, j.\nThis means that we can substitute any alternative for i (other than j) and the cross-elasticity will be the same and therefore the change in choice probability will be the same.\n\ni.e. We change the value of an attribute for alternative j. Then, all choice proabilities for the other alternatives (other than j) change by the same proportion. Doesn’t matter if alternative j is correlated more strongly with another alternative or not.\n\nShows a lack of flexibility in the logit model — there is no structure to model the correlation between alternatives. (See Mixed Logit)\n\n\nMarginal Effects\n\\[\n\\text{ME} = \\frac {\\partial P_{ni}} {\\partial z_{ni}} = \\beta_z P_{ni}(1-P_{ni})\n\\]\n\nThe change in the probability of choosing alternative, i, after a change in the attribute of alternative, i.\n\\(P_{ni}\\) is the probability of decision maker, n, choosing alternative i.\nCross Marginal Effect \\[\n\\text{CME} = \\frac {\\partial P_{ni}} {\\partial z_{nj}} = -\\beta_z P_{ni}P_{nj}\n\\]\n\nThe change in the probability of choosing alternative, \\(i\\), after a change in the attribute of alternative, \\(j\\).\n\n\nElasticity\n\\[\nE_{iz_{ni}} = \\beta_z z_{ni} (1-P_{ni})\n\\]\n\nMarginal Effects and Elasticities are similar except elasticities are percent change.\n\ne.g. a percentage change in a regressor results in this much of a percentage change in the response level probability\n\n\\(E_{iz_{ni}}\\) is the elasticity of the probability of alternative, i, with respect to \\(z_{ni}\\), an observed attribute of alternative, i\n\\(P_{ni}\\) is the predicted probability of alternative, i, for decision maker, n.\nCross Elasticity \\[\nE_{iz_{ni}} = -\\beta_z z_{nj} P_{nj}\n\\]"

Moreover, and more fundamentally, fitted probabilities and hence the likelihood for the nested-dichotomies model depend on how the nested dichotomies are defined.\nExample: 2 methods of splitting a 4-level response into dichotomies\n\n\nLeft: Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} → {1,2} vs {3,4} → {1} vs {2} and {3} vs {4}\nRight: (Continuous Logit) Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} → {1} vs {2, 3, 4} → {2} vs {3, 4} → {3} vs {4}\n\n{1} vs. {2,3,4} could represent highschool graduation\n{2} vs. {3,4} could represesnt enrollment in post-secondary education\n{3} vs. {4} could represent completion of a post-secondary degree.\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nAssumes Gumbel distribution of errors but relax the i.i.d. hypothesis\n\nAllows for the unobserved (and random) components of utility, \\(\\epsilon_{nj}\\) , to be correlated for the same decision maker\nExample: {drive} vs {carpool} and {bus} vs {train}\n\nModel allows from unobserved components of utility (i.e. residuals of the model) of drive and carpool to correlated for the same decision maker but not the unobserved components of utility for carpool and train.\n\n\nAssumes Exogenity (See Multinomial Logit &gt;&gt; Assumptions)\n\nThis model is also bad for panel data\n\n\nChoice Probability for alternative, i, and decision-maker, n\n\\[\nP_{ni} = \\frac {e^{V_{ni}/\\lambda_k}(\\sum_{j\\in B_k}e^{V_{nj}/\\lambda_k})^{\\lambda_k - 1}}{\\sum_{\\ell=1}^K (\\sum_{j\\in B_\\ell}e^{V_{nj}/\\lambda_\\ell})^{\\lambda_\\ell}}\n\\]\n\nThe probability that decision-maker, \\(n\\), chooses alternative, \\(i\\)\n\nPredicted probability output from the model\nWhen data is at the market level, the \\(n\\) index (i.e. individual) is removed from the equation above and the LHS becomes Market Share (See Terms).

The larger this coefficient the more cases fluctuate in their outcomes\nExample: Survey data with individual incomes over time\n\nHow the measure is different in a particular year compared to the individual average (e.g., do they have a lower or higher income compared to their normal income).\n\n\nExamples\n\nWhether obtaining more education leads to higher earnings.\nWhether wealthier countries tend to be more democratic than poorer countries\n\n\nFixed Effects or First Difference Estimator (FD)?\n\nTaking the first difference is an alternative to the demeaning step in the FE model\nIf the error terms are homoskedastic with no serial correlation, the fixed effects estimator is more efficient than the first difference estimator.\nIf the error follows a random walk, however, the first difference estimator is more efficient. If T=2, then they are numerically equivalent, and for T &gt; 2, they are not.\n\nIs the panel data balanced?\n\nplm::is.pbalanced(&lt;data&gt;, index = c(\"&lt;id_var&gt;\", \"&lt;time_var&gt;\"))\nBalanced - Has the same number of observations for all groups/units at each time point\nUnbalanced - At least one group/unit is not observed every period\n\ne.g. Have missing values at some time observations for some of the groups/units.\n\nCertain panel data models are only valid for balanced datasets.\n\nFor such models, data will need to be condensed to include only the consecutive periods for which there are observations for all individuals in the cross section.\n\n\nOmitted variable bias\n\nMultiple regression can correct for observable omitted variable bias, however, this cannot account for omitted unobservable factors that differ (e.g. from state to state) \n\nThis refers to doing two multivariable regression models - one for each time period\n\nFE models control for any omitted variables that are constant over time but vary between individuals by explicitly including a separate intercept term for each individual (\\(\\alpha_i\\)) in the regression equation\nYou can difference the outcome and difference predictor variables from period 1 to period 2 in order to remove the effects of unobserved omitted variables that are constant between the time periods\nFrom Kubinec differs regarding omitted variables\n\nAny statistical model should have, as its first requirement, that it match the researcher’s question. Problems of omitted variables are important, but necessarily secondary.\nFixed effects models do not control for omitted variables. What fixed effect models do is isolate one dimension of variance in the model. As a result, any variables that don’t vary on that dimension are by definition removed from the model. This side-effect is trumpeted as the great inferential benefit of fixed effect models, but it has nothing to do with inference. Fixed effects (or their cousin, random effects/hierarchical models) are simply about selecting which part of the panel dataset is most germane to the analysis."

There is no clear research question that matches this model.\nThe one known use of the model is for difference-in-difference estimation, but only with two time points. Says to read his paper for more details.\n\nIs this what the eor book is describing for unobserved omitted variables? (see above)\n\n\nSlope Value Unreliable\n\nOnly identifiable if there’s a different effect of x on y for each time point/case\n\nI think he’s saying if there is no variation in one of your fixed effects and you fit a two-way model anyways, the calculated effect is unreliable. He says the data looks normal and you wouldn’t recognize what happened necessarily.\n\nWhen this model is unidentifiable, R fixes the problem by deleting the last dummy variable (created by factor(fixed_effect_var)) and spits out the estimate.\n\nThe coefficient estimate for the removed dummy variable shows-up as an NA in the summary\n\n\n\nIt’s best to choose whether within-case or between-case effect is more important and fit the 1-way model.\n\ni.e. It is important to think about which dimension is more relevant, and then go with that dimension.\nAssumptions for a model with just an cases fixed effect\n\nResiduals have mean = 0 (i.e. errors uncorrelated with X)\n\nif violated, then omitted variable bias\n\nX (variable of interest) is i.i.d\n\nwithin-cases, autocorrelation is allowed (e.g. states)\n\nlarge outliers unlikely\nno perfect multicollinearity between variables\n\n\n\nPotential danger of biased effects when treatment is assigned during different periods for each group\n\nExample: group 1 is untreated at periods 1 and 2 and treated at period 3, while group 2 is untreated at period 1 and treated both at periods 2 and 3\nWhen the treatment effect is constant across groups and over time, FE regressions estimate that effect under the standard “common trends” assumption.\n\nRequires that the expectation of the outcome without treatment follow the same evolution over time in every group\n\nEstimates can be severely biased – and may even be incorrectly signed – when treatment effects change over time within treated units (aka hetergeneous treatment effects)\nFundamentally, the main reason TWFE estimates get weird and biased with differently-timed treatments is because of issues with weights—in TWFE settings, treated observations often get negative weights and vice versa\nAccording to Jakiela (2021, 5), negative weights in treated observations are more likely in (1) early adopter countries, since the country-level treatment mean is high, and (2) later years, since the year-level treatment mean is higher.\n\n\nSo, in general, the bias comes from entity variable categories that received the treatment early and the biased weight estimates occur on observations with later time values. This is because of the extreme treatment imbalance during these ranges/intervals, and its effect on the outcome variable.\n\nHaving negative weights on treated observations isn’t necessarily bad! It’s often just a mathematical artefact, and if you have (1) enough never-treated observations and (2) enough pre-treatment data, and if (3) the treatment effects are homogenous across all countries, it won’t be a problem. But if you don’t have enough data, your results will be biased and distorted for later years and for early adopters.\nDiagnostics\n\nDo any treated units get negative weight when calculating βTWFE? Check this by looking at the weights\nCan we reject the hypothesis that the treatment effects are homogenous? Check this by looking at the relationship between Yit and Dit. The slope shouldn’t be different.\n\ntreatment effect homogeneity implies a linear relationship between residualized outcomes and residualized treatment after removing the fixed effects\n\n\nComments\n\nShe states that she’s only looking for linearity between the two sets of residuals, but actually breaks it down further by checking whether the relationship varies by treatment. This whole procedure is computing a partial correlation except instead of the last step of measuring the correlation between the two sets of residuals (e.g. cor.test(treatment_resid, out_resid) and getting the p-value, she looks at an interaction.\nI don’t understand the homogeneity check in 3.2 though. She says that if the linearity relationship varies by treatment then this breaks assumptions for TWFE models. I’ve only looked at her paper and the Chaisemartin paper, and the only assumptions I saw for TWFE models in general was the “common trends” and the “strong exogeneity” assumption. I think this is more likely to be about the “common trends” assumption, and my understanding of that one is that it pertains to the effect across time for a particular group. I’m guessing there’s a connection between those two concepts, but I’m not seeing it."

When the number of clusters, G, is small, cluster-robust standard errors tend to be too small, sometimes much too small. Hence, the second rule of thumb is considerably less likely to lead to severe over-rejection than the first one. However, because it is conservative, it can lead to loss of power (or, equivalently, confidence intervals that are unnecessarily long).\n\n\nRecommended: Cluster at the treatment level\n\ne.g. If the treatment is assigned by classroom then cluster by classroom\nBut if there’s concern of significant spillover effects, then cluster at a coarser level than the treatment level (e.g. schools)\n\n\nDiagnostics\n\nStatistical testing for the correct level of clustering\n\nHard to tell but I don’t think any of the tests were recommended in the paper\n\nChecking for influential clusters\n\nInfluential Cluster - Estimates change a lot when it’s deleted.\n“In a few extreme cases, there may be a cluster \\(h\\) for which it is impossible to compute \\(β_j^{(h)}\\). If so, then the original estimates should probably not be believed.\n\nThis will happen, for example, when cluster \\(h\\) is the only treated one. Inference is extremely unreliable in that case.”\n\n\nPlacebo Regressions\n\nProcess\n\nAdd a random dummy variable to the model\nfit model check if dummy variable is significant\nrepeat many times\n\nBecause a placebo regressor is artificial, we would expect valid significance tests at level α to reject the null close to α% of the time when the experiment is repeated many times.\nExample:\n\nClustering at levels below state-level leads to rejection rates far greater than α\nUsing a state-level CRVE is important for survey data that samples individuals from multiple states. If we fail to do so, we will find, with probability much higher than α, that nonsense regressors apparently belong in the model.\n\ni.e. placebo regressors are significant &gt; 5% of the time\n\n\nA placebo-regressor experiment should lead to over-rejection whenever both the regressor and the residuals display intra-cluster correlation at a coarser level than the one at which the standard errors are clustered. (e.g. &lt; 5%)\nIf the placebo regressor is clustered at the coarse level, we would expect significance tests based on heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors to over-reject whenever the residuals are clustered at either level. Similarly, we would expect significance tests based on finely-clustered standard errors to over-reject whenever the residuals are clustered at the coarse level. Table 4 in Section 8.2 displays both of these phenomena."

(2011). “A New Heteroskedasticity-Consistent Covariance Matrix Estimator for the Linear Regression Model.” Advances in Statistical Analysis, 95(2), 129–146\n\n\nGuidelines\n\ntl;dr - Use HC3 (default method for vcovHC) for small to moderately sized data sets and jackknife, vcovBS(..., type = \"jackknife\") or vcovJK, for large datasets (HC3 computation will fail).\nIf sample size is small and heteroskedasticity present, then H0, H1, or H2 shouldn’t be used. H3 isn’t quite as reliable as regular OLS standard errors.\nIf heteroskedasticity present, then H3 is superior, otherwise H2 better than H1 which is better than H0\nNo real guidance on HC4, HC5, and modified HC4m. See paper (above)\n\n\n\n\nHeteroskedastic and Autocorrelation (HAC) Consistent\n\nDiscussed in Hanck book\nSimilar as for heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation invalidates the usual standard error formulas as well as heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors since these are derived under the assumption that there is no autocorrelation.\nR2 and F test not affected (Wald test preferred when heterskadasticity and autocorrelation present)\n\nnot sure where I got this.

They allow for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelated errors within an entity but not correlation across entities.\nFrom https://datascience.blog.wzb.eu/2021/05/18/clustered-standard-errors-with-r/\nIn ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, we assume that the regression model errors are independent. This is not the case here: Each subject may be surveyed several times so within each subject’s repeated measures, the errors will be correlated. Although that is not a problem for our regression estimates (they are still unbiased [Roberts 2013], it is a problem for for the precision of our estimates — the precision will typically be overestimated, i.e. the standard errors (SEs) will be lower than they should be [Cameron and Miller 2013]. The intuition behind this regarding our example is that within our clusters we usually have lower variance since the answers come from the same subject and are correlated. This lowers our estimates’ SEs.\nvcovCL() will give STATA clustered standard errors.\nvcovCL()may be biased downwards\n\nCircumstances where it may be biased downwards (i.e. CIs too small)\n\nImprecise calculations arise when there is a low number of clusters (e.g. classrooms, schools)\n\nless than 50 clusters\n\nMulti-way (i.e. more than 1 fixed effect in panel data)\nIf the cluster sizes are wildly different.\nIf the intra-cluster correlations varies across clusters.\n\nSolutions:\n\nvcovJK -Not downward biased and yield better coverage rates for confidence intervals compared to other “robust” covariance estimates\n\nBased on leave-one-out estimates of the coefficients/parameters of a model. This means that the model is reestimated after dropping each observational unit once, i.e., each individual observation in independent observations or each cluster in dependent data\nHC3 seems to be an estimate of the Jackknife. To obtain HC3 covariances that exactly match the jackknife covariances, the jackknife has to be centered with the full-sample estimates (arg center = “estimate”) and the right finite-sample adjustment (?) has to be selected for the HC3.\n\nSatterthwaite corrected cluster robust sandwich estimator (?)\nWild Cluster Bootstrap {clubSandwich} {fwildclusterboot}\n\nComputationally expensive\n\nfwildclusterboot is VERY fast though\n\n\nFor small cluster sizes, choose wild cluster bootstrap over Satterthwaite corrected cluster robust sandwich estimator when: (article)\n\nExtreme treatment proportions (e.g. 80% obs treated, 10% control)\nExtreme differences in cluster sizes (i.e. extreme imbalance)\n\n{ceser} - Cluster-estimated standard errors\n\nMore conservative than the CRSE method, sandwich::vcovCL\nLess sensitive to the number of clusters and to the heterogeneity of the clusters, which can be a problem for both CRSE and bootstrap methods\nAlso has heteroskedacity corrections: HC0, HC1, HC2, HC3, or HC4"

Instead of comparing treatment and control groups within the same population at the same time, we can compare the relative change across treatment and control populations across time.\nWhen you have group-level treatments or data available, use random variation across populations to compare their overall trends over time\nPackages\n\n{did}\n\nManually\ndf_did &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(after = year &gt;= 2014) %&gt;%\n  mutate(treatafter = after*treat)\nreg &lt;- lm(murder ~ treat + treatafter + after, data = DiD)\nBasically a standard lm with an interaction between the treatment indicator and time period indicator demarking before/after treatment.\n\nPredictions\n\n\nThe DiD effect works out to be the interaction effect, \\(\\beta_3\\) = (2nd - 1st eq) - (4th - 3rd eq)\n\nExample\n\nWe want to estimate the effect of a store remodel on visits.\nA remodel affects all potential customers, so this “treatment” cannot be applied at the individual level; in theory, it could be randomized to individual stores, but we do not have the budget for or interest in randomly remodel many stores before there is evidence of a positive effect.\n\nApproach\n\nIn two separate populations, one receives the treatment and one does not. We believe but-for the treatment the two populations would have similar trends in outcome\nWe can estimate the treatment effect by taking the difference between the (post-treatment difference between populations)(solid lines after treatment) and (the pre-treatment difference between populations) (solid lines before treatment)\n\nDiD’s control (dotted line) is an extrapolation of the treatment case that must be parallel to the mean post-treatment outcome (green line post-treatment) of the non-treated case\nThe effect is the difference between DiD’s control (blue dotted line) and the post-treatment outcome (blue line post-treatment) of the treated case.\n\nIn effect, this is the same as extrapolating the counterfactual for the treated population in the post-treatment period if it had not received treatment (the dashed line in the image above)\nTechnically, this is implemented as a fixed-effects regression model\n\nKey Assumptions\n\nThe decision to treat the treatment group was not influenced by the outcome (no anticipation to treat)\n\ne.g. poverty rate spikes and community expects a policy to be enacted soon, so it acts (spends money, etc.) in anticipation of that help coming\n\nIf not for the treatment, the two groups being compared would have parallel trends in the outcome. Note that groups are allowed to have different levels but must have similar trends over time\n\nPretesting parallel trends assumption:\n\n{did} vignette\n{HonestDiD} vignette\nThese aren’t particularly liked. Tests are considered low-powered\n\nOptions if this assumption is violated\n\nUse pre-treatment variables to filter data to create similar groups (Treatment/Control) so they are more likely to have similar trends (pre-cursor to Synthetic Controls method)\n\nEestimate the propensity score based on observed covariates; compute the fitted value\nRun a weighted DiD model\n\nExtrapolate the difference in pre-treatment trends to post-treatment (paper) (Also see {HonestDiD})\nUse a “differential trends” method (explainer, says code available on request)\n\nincludes each post-intervention time period as a dummy variable in your model, and average these to obtain an average treatment effect\n\nCombination of DiD and IV (paper)\n\n\nThere is no spill-over effect such that treating the treatment group has an effect on the control group\n\nApplication\n\nWe can estimate the effect of a store remodel on visits by comparing store traffic before and after the remodel with traffic at a store that did not remodel.\nNote how sensitive this method is to our assumptions:\n\nIf the remodel is an expansion and caused by a foreseen increase in traffic, our first assumption is violated and our effect will be overestimated\nIf the control we chose is another nearby store in the same town, we could experience spillover effects where more people who would have otherwise gone to the control store decide to go to the treatment store instead. This again would overestimate the effect\nAnother counter-example that violates the assumption would be measuring the effect of placing a certain product brand near a store’s check-out on sales and using sales of a different brand of the same product as the control. Why? Since these products are substitutes, the product placement of the treatment group could “spillover” to negatively effect sales of the control\n\n\nRelated Methods\n\nVariants exist that relax different assumptions. For example, we may consider cases in which different units receive the treatment at different times, different units have different (heterogenous) treatment effects, the parallel trend assumption only holds after conditioning on covariates, and many more scenarios\nSynthetic control methods can be thought of as an extension of difference-in-differences where the control is a weighted average of a number of different possible controls\nBayesian structural time-series methods relax the “parallel trends” asumptions of difference-in-differences by modeling the relationship between time series (including trend and seasonal components)\n\nAbadie, Alberto (2005). “Semiparametric Difference-in-Differences Estimators,” Review of Economic Studies (2005) 72, 1–19\n\nAssumption: non-parallel outcome dynamics between treated and controls caused by observed characteristics\nTwo-step strategy:\n\nEstimate the propensity score based on observed covariates; compute the fitted value\nRun a weighted DiD model\n\nThe idea of using pre-treatment variables to adjust trends is a precursor to synthetic control\n\nStrezhnev (2018) extends this approach to incorporate pre-treatment outcomes\nOther considerations (article)\n\nLevels are important.\n\nAlways look at differences in levels between treatment and control, and not just trends. If there are large differences, than think about why they are so different.\nCould these differences affect future trends in our outcome of differences?\n\nFunctional forms matter.\n\nWhen comparing our treatment and control trends, do we think that they evolve similarly in terms of absolute or relative terms? Do we want to use levels or logs?\n\nPre-treatment parallel tests are problematic.\n\nOnly because we reject an unequal parallel trend does not mean that we confirmed its validity, and often, these rejection tests are underpowered.\n\n\nStepped Design (Athey)\n\nAssumptions\n\nAdoption date is conditional on the potential outcomes and possibly pretreatment variables. Guaranteed by design\n\nYou can relax (troublesome) random assignment assumption by requiring only that the adoption date is completely random within subpopulations with the same values for the pre-treatment variables (e.g. units are clusters of individuals like states)\n\nPotential outcomes which rules out the presence of certain treatment effects\n\nNo anticipation - outcome at present is not affected by anticipation of a future treatment date.\nInvariance to history - duration of treatment prior to a given period doesn’t affect the outcome variable value for that period\n\nMore plausible when units are clusters of individuals (e.g. states)\n\n\n\n“Auxillary” Assumptions (i.e. Sometimes needed for particular analyses)\n\nConstant treatment effect across time\nConstant treatment effect across units"

    "section": "Synthetic Control Method (SCM)",
    "text": "Synthetic Control Method (SCM)\n\nCreates a synthetic control based on the pre-treatment features of the treatment unit and non-treated units. A control that’s based on comparison units (i.e. non-treatment units) often provides a better control than a control solely based on the treated unit (like in DiD). After treatment, you take the difference between this synthetic control and your treatment unit to estimate the effect of the treatment. Similar to DiD, except on how the control is formulated.\nMisc\n\nNotes from: Using Synthetic Controls: Feasibility, Data Requirements, and Methodological Aspects\nExtensions\n\nGeneralized synthetic control by Xu (2017)\nSynthetic difference-in-differences by Doudchenko and Imbens (2017)\nPenalized synthetic control of Abadie e L’Hour (2020)\nMatrix completion methods of Athey et al. (2021)\n\n\nTerms\n\nDonor Pool or Donors: The group of units that are untreated which are used to calculate the synthetic control\nUnit, Cell, Case: Interchangeable names for the population level you’re testing in the experiement (e.g. herd, school, store, city, state, precinct)\n\nRecommended Use Cases\n\nWhen events take place at the aggregated level, e.g. county, state, province.\nYou only have one treated unit and a few control units.\n\nAdvantages\n\nBetter apples to apples comparison that DiD since the control should be a better estimate.\nThe weights (which sum to 1) from the calculation of the synthetic control add to the interpretability of the method by giving us information about the “importance” of each non-treated unit in the formulation of the synthetic control\n\nThe donor weights are sparse due to the optimization process. Only a few donors contribute to the synthetic control.\n\nSCM provides transparency about how different the non-treatment units are from the treatment unit. This difference can be calculated.\nThe choice of a synthetic control does not rely on the post-intervention outcomes, which makes it impossible to cherrypick the study design that may affect the conclusions.\n\nChoosing Units for the Donor Pool\n\nThe risk of over-fitting may also increase with the size of the donor pool, especially when T0 (pre-treatment period) is small\nEach of the units in the donor pool have to be chosen judiciously to provide a reasonable control for the treated unit. Including in the donor pool units that are regarded by the analyst to be unsuitable controls (because of large discrepancies in the values of their observed attributes Zj or because of suspected large differences in the values of the unobserved attributes μj relative to the treated unit) is a recipe for bias.\nDonor units with similar values of the observed predictors as the treated unit should be chosen. If it’s believed that a unit has a large unobserved difference with the treated unit, it shouldn’t be included.\nAs a rule of thumb, Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010) suggest excluding units for which the prediction MSE is larger than twice the MSE of the treated unit.\n\nPredictors\n\nPredictors are often time series reported by government agencies, multilateral organizations, and private entities (e.g. GDP, crime statistics, cigarette usage, census survey micro-data\nThe predictors of the outcome variable, which are used to calculate the synthetic control, are not affected by the treatment\n\nData\n\nThe larger the pre-treatment period the smaller the bias of the synthetic control estimator (assuming the synthetic control closely tracks the outcome variable during the pre-treatment period.\n\nA trade-off of obtaining more pre-treatment data may be that the predictors are better short term than long term.\n\nIf this is the case, adding weights that favor more recent predictor data can help\n\nIf the amount of pretreatment data is relatively small, then you need very good predictors of the post-treatment outcome such that residual variance will be small which will reduce the chance of overfitting.\n\n\nRobustness Checks\n\nin-time placebo test (backdating): move the treatment date backwards in the data. If the synthetic control still closely tracks the outcome variable until the actual treatment date, then this is evidence of a reliable synthetic control\n\n\nActual date of the treatment (i.e. German reunification) is 1990. Here the re-calculated synthetic control (dashed line) using 1980 as the treatment still tracks GDP until the actual treatment date then they split. Therefore this is evidence of a credible synthetic control.\n\nRobustness with alternate design\n\nMethods\n\nRemove a donor from the donor pool and refit the model and see if the results hold. Repeat with each donor.\n\n\nAll synthetic checks closely track pretreatment GDP and are centered around the synthetic control that used all the donors. Effect for all the synthetic checks are still negative. Evidence of robustness.\nIf the exclusion of a unit from the donor pool has a large effect on results without a discernible change in pre-intervention fit, this may warrant investigating if the change in the magnitude of the estimate is caused by the effects of other interventions or by particularly large idiosyncratic shocks on the outcome of the excluded untreated unit (see Potential Issues and Solutions below)\n\nThe choice of predictors of the outcome variable (no example given)\n\n\nPre-Post Error Ratio\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\text{MSE}_{\\text{post}}}{\\text{MSE}_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t\\in \\text{post}}(Y_t - \\hat Y_t)^2}{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t\\in \\text{pre}}(Y_t - \\hat Y_t)^2}\n\\]\n\nAbadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010) suggest to perform a randomization test is the ratio between pre-treatment MSE and post-treatment MSE.\nP-Value (article)\nlambdas = {}\nfor city in cities:\n    mse_pre = synth_predict(df, SyntheticControl(), city, treatment_year).mse\n    mse_tot = np.mean((df[f'Synthetic [{city}]{style='color: #990000'}'] - df[city])**2)\n    lambdas[city] = (mse_tot - mse_pre) / mse_pre\n\nprint(f\"p-value: {np.mean(np.fromiter(lambdas.values(), dtype='float') &gt; lambdas[treated_city]):.4}\")\n\n\nPotential Issues and Solutions\n\nVolatility of the outcome variable is low. Small or even large effects are difficult to detect if the outcome experiences a lot of shocks that are larger or comparable to the size of the effect.\n\nIn units where substantial volatility is present in the outcome of interest it is advisable to remove it via filtering, in both the treatment unit as well as in the non-treatment units, before applying synthetic control techniques\n\nIdiosyncratic shocks in donor units\n\nimportant to eliminate from the donor pool any units that may have suffered large idiosyncratic shocks to the outcome variable during the treatment period, if it is judged that such shocks would not have affected the outcome of the treatment unit in the absence of the intervention.\n\nI guess the shocks indicate a substantial difference between the treatment unit and the donor\n\n\nAnticipation: if any agents jumped the gun in anticipation of a policy/treatment and engaged in behavior that affects a predictor or outcome variable, the SCM results may be biased.\n\nIf this happens, the treatment date in the dataset should be moved back to just before the agent began it’s behavior or the change in the variable occurred in reaction to agent’s behavior.\n\nSpillover: Donor units experience effects of the treatment even though they weren’t treated. Common if donor units are in close geographical proximity to the treatment unit.\n\nDonor units affected by spillover should be removed from the dataset.\nIf you do include the donor, make note of the direction of the bias. Then, if the bias has a “negative” effect on the treatment effect, you can say the synthetic control estimate provides a lower bound on the magnitude of the causal effect of the treatment\n\nExtreme values in the treatment unit\n\nIf the extreme values are in a predictor variable, but the synthetic control tracks the observed outcome in the pretreatment period, then all is well.\nIf the synthetic control doesn’t track, then the outcome variable should be transformed to differences or growth rates\n\nLong time horizons: Some treatments effects take a long time to emerge.\n\nIn these cases, you either have to just continue to wait, use surrogate outcomes, or use leading indicators\n\nI think “surrogate outcomes” means indirect or proxy measures of the outcome of interest\nAnd leading indicators isn’t referring to normal usage as a predictor but to use as the outcome."

ITS presents a long-term analytical framework with more extended periods, which better explain any data trends.\nTo account for individual-level bias and to evaluate the outcome variable at the population level. Individual-level data may introduce bias, but not with population data. Honestly, this is both a blessing and a curse. We will elaborate more on the latter aspect in the following part.\nTo evaluate both intended and unintended consequences of interventions. We can easily enlarge analysis and incorporate more outcome variables with minimum or no adaptations.\nTo conduct stratified analyses of subpopulations of individuals and to derive different causal effects. This is critical. We can divide the total population into different sub-groups according to various criteria and examine how each sub-group may behave differently. Social groups are different, and grouping them together may dilute or hide critical information, as positive and negative effects mix together and cancel out (see Harper and Bruckner for examples).\nTo provide clear and interpretable visual results. Visual inspections are always welcome and should be treated seriously (See my other post for more explanations).\n\nLimitations\n\nMultiple rounds of data entries. A minimum of 8 periods before and 8 after an intervention to evaluate the changes. So, we need a total of 16 data entries, which may not be possible all the time. I think Penfold and Zhang (2013) are being cautious about the number of data entries. It’s still possible to apply ITS with few rounds of data entry. Just the causal power may not as robust as the one with multiple rounds.\nTime lag. It takes some unknown time for a program to achieve intended results, which makes it difficult to pinpoint the causal effects of several events that coincide. Let’s say the transportation department in the U.S. adopt three policies within a two-year timespan to curb highway speeding. Playing God, we somehow know it would take 1 yr for Policy A to have any effect, 1.5 ys for Policy B, and 3 yrs for Policy C. In the meantime, it becomes impossible to separate the intertwined effects using ITS.\nInference Level. It’s population-level data, so we can’t make inferences about each individual.\n\nPower and Sample Size Considerations\n\nNumber of time points in each before- and after- segment\n\nRecommendations range from 3 time points per segment to 50 time points per segment\n\nAverage sample size per time point\nFrequency of time points (e.g. weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.)\nLocation of intervention (e.g. midway, 1/3, 2/3, etc.)\n\nAs long as there are sufficient time points per segment and each time point is supported by a large enough sample size, there is not much difference in the study power of an early or late intervention\n\nExpected effect size\n\nSlope change: a gradual change in gradient (or slope) of trend\nLevel change: an instant change in level (i.e. mean)"

    "text": "Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)\n\n\nRDDs generate asymptotically unbiased estimates of the effect of an intervention if:\n\nThe relationship between the outcome and running variable is modeled appropriately\n\nDon’t use a particular curve to justify the discontinuity. Gelman prefers reasonable nonlinear curves but don’t go crazy with it so that it maximizes the effect.\n\nThe forcing variable was not manipulated (either behaviorally or mechanically) to influence assignment to the intervention group.\n\ne.g. if the running variable is a test score and the threshold is a particular test score, is there evidence of some sort of cheating to where assignment of students around the threshold isn’t random? (see bullet under step 1 below)\n\n\nMisc\n\nGelman: The big mistakes seem to come from:\n\nUnregularized regression on the forcing variable which randomly give you wild jumpy curves that pollute the estimate of the discontinuity\nNot adjusting for other important pre-treatment predictors\nTaking statistically significant estimates and treating them as meaningful, without looking at the model that’s been fit.\n\nUsecases\n\nLee study of the incumbency effect\n\nWe want to know if a party holding a House seat gives that party an advantage in the next election. But candidates who win (the incumbent) tend to better than challengers from the same party. To overcome this, Lee used an RDD with the Democratic share of the two-party vote in the last election as the forcing variable for Democratic incumbency in the current election. Thee key idea is that, in close elections, seats where a Democratic candidate won will have similar characteristics to districts where a Democratic candidate lost.\n\n\nLakeland recommends using Bayesian estimation and Chebyshev Polynomials\n\nTypes\n\nSharp RDD:\n\nThe threshold separates the treatment and control group exactly\n\nFuzzy RDD:\n\nThe threshold influences the probability of being treated\nThis is in fact an instrumental variable approach (estimating a LATE)\n\n\nTerms\n\nForcing or Assignment or Running Variable:\n\nUsed to assign units to the intervention group and comparison group on either side of a fixed threshold (Cutoff Score).\nMay or may not be related to the potential outcomes but we assume that relationship is smooth, so that changes in the outcome around the threshold can be interpreted as a causal effect.\n\nBandwidth - The number of points selected on each side of the cutoff\n\nShould be wide enough to include a sufficient number of observations and obtain precise estimates. It should also be narrow enough to compare similar units and reduce selection bias.\nCurrent best practice for defining the “neighborhood” of the threshold is to use weights based on a triangular kernel and an “optimal” bandwidth proposed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012). The optimal bandwidth is derived for the simple RDD model with no covariates, though the authors comment that inclusion of additional covariates should not greatly affect the result unless the covariates are strongly correlated with the outcome, conditional on the running variable.\n\n\nSteps\n\nFind and include adjustment variables for differences between the treatment and control groups. Avoid only adjusting for one pre-treatment variable.\n\nThose individuals on both sides of the cut-off point, should be very similar (i.e. it’s more or less random that they’re on one side of the cutoff and not the other). Therefore have something close to a random allocation into treatment and control group\n\ni.e if the cutoff is a test score of 71, then, characteristically, students scoring a 70 should be very similar to students scoring a 72.\n\nIncluding covariates shouldn’t affect the LATE very much but should help lower the std errors some.\n\nIf there is a large effect then the function is probably creating interaction terms with treatment and the covariates. (see bkmk)\n\n\nFit a regression line (or curve) for the intervention group and similarly for the comparison group,\nThe difference in these regression lines at the threshold value of the forcing variable is the estimate of the effect of the intervention (i.e. Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)).\n\nExample: Corruption\n\nFrom\n\nArticle: Quasi-Experimental Design: Regression Discontinuity Design\nPaper: Businesspeople in Elected Office: Identifying Private Benefits from Firm-Level Returns\n\nDo businesspeople who win elected office in Russia use their positions to help their former firms?\nVariables:\n\nOutcome:\n\nLog total revenue of the candidate’s former firm\nProfit margin: net profit/total revenue during last year of term if member won election or if the member lost, the last year of the hypothetical term if they had won.\n\nTreatment: electoral victory or not (1/0)\nRunning: Vote margin (difference between former firm member/current candidate and their opponent\n\nnegative if former firm member lost, positive if they won\nCutoff = 0\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nCheck for manipulation of the running variable\n\nExamine the balance along a range of covariates between winning and losing candidates in close elections (i.e. around the threshold).\n\nIf no significant imbalance is detected, then there’s no evidence that electoral manipulation favors a specific type of candidate or firm\nIs there any coordination among firms and their candidates?\n\nIf so, we’d expect to see a sharing of the spoils after the election.

    "section": "Considerations",
    "text": "Considerations\n\nMotivation for using a Random Effects model\n\nYou think the little subgroups are part of some bigger group with a common mean effect\n\ne.g. multiple observations of a single person, or multiple people in a school, or multiple schools in a district, or multiple varieties of a single kind of fruit, or multiple kinds of vegetable from the same harvest, or multiple harvests of the same kind of vegetable, etc.\n\nThese subgroup means significantly deviate from the big group mean.\nThese deviations follow a distribution, typically Gaussian.\n\nThat’s where the “random” in random effects comes in: we’re assuming the deviations of subgroups from a parent follow the distribution of a random (Gaussian) variable\n\nThe variation between subgroups is assumed to have a normal distribution with a 0 mean and constant variance (variance estimated by the model).\n\nGEEs are a semi-parametric option for panel data (See Regression, Other &gt;&gt; Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE))\n\n\nFixed Effects or Random Effects?\n\nIf there’s likely correlation between unobserved group/cases variables (e.g. individual talent) and treatment variable (i.e. E(α|x) != 0) AND there’s substantial variance between group units, then FE is a better choice (See Econometrics, Fixed Effects &gt;&gt; One-Way Fixed Effects &gt;&gt; Assumptions)\nIf cases units change little, or not at all, across time, a fixed effects model may not work very well or even at all (SEs for a FE model will be large)\n\nThe FE model is for analyzing within-units variance\n\nDo we wish to estimate the effects of variables whose values do not change across time, or do we merely wish to control for them?\n\nFE: these effects aren’t estimated but adjusted for by explicitly including a separate intercept term for each individual (αi) in the regression equation\nRE: estimates these effects (might be biased if RE assumptions violated)\n\nThe RE model is for analyzing between-units variance\n\n\nThe amount of within-unit variation relative to between-unit variation has important implications for these two approaches\n\nArticle with simulated data showed that within variation around sd &lt; 0.5 didn’t detect the effect of explanatory variable but ymmv (depends on # of units, observations per unit, N)\n\nDurbin–Wu–Hausman test ({plm::phtest})\n\nIf H0 is not rejected, then both FE and RE are consistent but only RE is efficient. \\(\\rightarrow\\) use RE but if you have a lot of data, then FE is also fine.\nIf H0 is rejected, then only FE is consistent \\(\\rightarrow\\) use FE\n\nICC &gt; 0.1 is generally accepted as the minimal threshold for justifying the use of Mixed Effects Model (See Diagnostics &gt;&gt; ICC)\n\nPooling\n\nComplete pooling - Each unit is assumed to have the same effect\n\nExample: County is the grouping variable and radon level is the outcome\n\nAll counties are alike.\n\ni.e. all characteristics of counties that affect radon levels in houses have the statistically same effect across counties. Therefore, the variable has no information.\n\nRun a single regression to estimate the average radon level in the whole state.\n\nlm(radon_level ~ predictors)\nNote that “county” is NOT a predictor in this model\n\n\n\nNo pooling - All units are assumed to have independent effects\n\nExample: County is the grouping variable (although not a predictor in this case) and radon level is the outcome\n\nAll counties are different from each other.\n\ni.e. there are no common characteristics of counties that affect radon levels in houses. Any characteristic a county has that affects radon levels is unique to that county.\n\nRun a regression for each county to estimate the average radon level for each county.\n\nlm(radon_level ~ 0 + county + predictors\nUsing the “0 +” formula removes the common intercept which means each county will get it’s own intercept\n\n\n\nPartial pooling - Each unit is assumed to have a different effect, but the data for all of the observed units informs the estimates for each unit\n\nExample: County is the grouping variable (random effect) and radon level is the outcome\n\nAll counties are similar each other.\n\ni.e. all charcteristics of counties that affect radon levels in house have statistically varying effects sizes depending on the particular county\n\nRun a multi-level regression to share information across counties.\n\nlmer(radon_level ~ predictors + (1 + predictor | county))\n\n\nThis can be a nice compromise between estimating an effect by completely pooling all groups, which masks group-level variation, and estimating an effect for all groups completely separately, which could give poor estimates for low-sample groups.\nIf you have few data points in a group, the group’s effect estimate will be based partially on the more abundant data from other groups. (2 min video)\nPartial pooling is typically accomplished through hierarchical models. Hierarchical models directly model the population of units. From a population model perspective, no pooling corresponds to infinite population variance, whereas complete pooling corresponds to zero population variance.\n\n\nVariable Assignment\n\nQuestions (article has examples)\n\nCan the groups we see be considered the full population of possible groups we could see, or are they more like a random sample of a larger set of groups?\n\nFull Population: Fixed\nRandom Sample: Random\n\nDo we want to estimate a coefficient for this grouping, or do we just want to account for the anticipated structure that the groups may impose on our observations?\n\nY: Fixed\nN: Random\n\n\nFixed Effects provide estimates of mean-differences or slopes.\n\n“Fixed” because they are effects that are constant for each subject/unit\nLevel One: variables measured at the most frequently occurring observational unit\n\ni.e. vary for each repeated measure of a subject and vary between subjects\n\nIn the dataset, these variables that (for the most part) have different values for each row\nTime-dependent if you have longitudinal data\n\nFor a RE model, these are usually the adjustment variables\n\ne.g. conditioning on a confounder\n\n\nLevel Two: variables measured at the observational unit level\n\ni.e. constant for each repeated measure of a subject but vary between each subject\nFor a RE model, these are usually the treatment variables or variables of interest\n\nThey should contain the information about the between-subject variation\n\nIf a factor variable, it has levels which would not change in replications of the study\n\n\nRandom Effects estimate of variation between and within subgroups\n\nClustering variable\nQuantifies how much of the overall variation can be attributed to that particular variable.\n\nExample: the variation in beetle DAMAGE was attributable to the FARM at which the damage took place, so you’d cluster by FARM (1|FARM)\n\nIf you want slopes to vary according to a variable, the variation of slopes between-units will be a random effect\n\nUsually a level 2 fixed effect variable\n\nIf you want intercepts to vary according to a variable, the variation of intercepts between-units will be a random effect\n\nThis will the unit/subject variable (e.g student id, store id) that has the repeated observations\n\nTypically categorical variables that we are not interested in measuring their effects on the outcome variable, but we do want to adjust for. This variation might capture effects of latent variables.\n\nThis factor variable has levels which can be thought of as a sample from a larger population of factor levels (e.g. hockey players)\nExample: 2 hockey players both averaged around 20 minutes per game last year (fixed variable). Predictions of the amount of points scored by just accounting for this fixed variable would produce similar results. But using PLAYER as a random variable will capture the impact of persistent characteristics that might not be observable elsewhere in the explanatory data. PLAYER can be thought of as a proxy for “offensive talent” in a way.\n\nIf the values of the variable were chosen at random, then you should cluster by that variable (i.e. choose as the random variable)\n\nExample: If you can rerun the study using different specific farms (i.e .different values of the FARM factor, see above) and still be able to draw the same conclusions, then FARM should be a random effect.\n\nHowever, if you had wanted to compare or control for these particular farms, then Farm would be “fixed.”\nSay that there is nothing about comparing these specific fields that is of interest to the researcher. Rather, the researcher wants to generalize the results of this experiment to all fields. Then, FIELD would be “random.”\n\n\nIf the random effects are correlated with variables of interest (fixed effects), leaving them out could lead to biased fixed effects. Including them can help more reliably isolate the influence of the fixed effects of interest and more accurately model a clustered system.\nTo see individual random effects: lme4::ranef(lme_mod) or lme4::ranef(tidy_mod$fit)"

    "text": "BMLR Chapter 8: Multilevel Models\n\nBeyond Multiple Linear Regression, Chapter 8: Introduction to Multilevel Models\nVariable Types\n\nLevel One: variables measured at the most frequently occurring observational unit\n\ni.e. Variables that (for the most part) have different values for each row\ni.e. Vary for each repeated measure of a subject and vary between subjects\n\nLevel Two: variables measured on larger observational units\n\ni.e. Constant for each repeated measure of a subject but vary between each subject\n\n\nData Description in the Examples\n\nna (outcome) - Negative Affect (i.e. Performance Anxiety)\nlarge - binary\n\nlarge = 1 means the performance type is a Large Ensemble\nlarge = 0 means the performance type is either a Solo or Small Ensemble\n\norch - binary\n\norch = 1 means the instrument is Orchestral\norch = 0 means the instrument is either a Keyboard or it’s Vocal\n\n\nTwo-Stage Model\n\nThe 2-stage model shows a clearer depiction of how a multi-level model is fit in principle\n\n2-stage model uses Ordinary Least Squares to fit a system of regression equations in stages\nThe multi-level model fits a composite of that system of equations using Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n\nProcess\n\nLevel 1 models are fitted for each subject/unit\nUsing the estimated level 1 intercepts and slopes as outcome variables, Level 2 intercept and slope models respectively are fit\nThe errors from the Level 2 models are the random effects\n\nIssues\n\nWeights every subject the same regardless of the number of repeated observations\nResponds to missing individual slopes (i.e. subjects never exposed to treatment) by simply dropping those subjects\nDoes not share strength effectively across subjects\n\nSpecification\n\nLevel 1\n\\[\nY_{ij} = a_i + b_i \\text{large}_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\n\n\\(b_i\\) is the fixed effect for subject/unit \\(i\\) and observation \\(j\\) (i.e. each subject has repeated observations)\n\nLevel 2\n\\[\na_i = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 \\text{orch}_i + u_i \\\\\nb_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{orch}_i + v_i\n\\]\n\n\\(u_i\\) and \\(v_i\\) are the random effects for subject/unit \\(i\\)\n\\(a_i\\) is the true (i.e. not estimated since no hat) mean of performance anxiety (outcome) when subject plays solos or small ensembles (large = 0)\n\\(b_i\\) is the true mean difference in performance anxiety (outcome) for subjecti between large ensembles and other performance types (large contrast)\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Level\n\nProcess\n\nLevel 1 and Level 2 equations have been combined through substitution then reduced into a composite model\nParameters estimated through Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n\nMisc\n\nError Distribution\n\nCorrelation between parameters is accounted for using a multivariate normal distribution estimated through a variance-covariance matrix of the error terms (aka random effects) of each Level (see link for details)\n\nAdding Level 1 variables to a model formula should change within-person variability (\\(\\hat\\sigma^2\\) and \\(\\hat\\sigma\\))\n\nEven without adding a Level 1 variable, small changes could occur due to numerical estimation procedures used in likelihood-based parameter estimates\n\nOptimization methods\n\nUsually very little difference between ML and REML parameter estimates\nRestricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) is preferable when the number of parameters is large or the primary interest is obtaining estimates of model parameters, either fixed effects or variance components associated with random effects\nMaximum Likelihood (MLE) should be used if nested fixed effects models are being compared using a likelihood ratio test, although REML is fine for nested models of random effects that have the same fixed effects.\n\nP-Values\n\nCan’t be calculated because the exact distribution of the test statistics under the null hypothesis (no fixed effect) is unknown, primarily because the exact degrees of freedom is not known\nRule of Thumb: t-values (ratios of parameter estimates to estimated standard errors) with absolute value above 2 indicate significant evidence that a particular model parameter is different than 0\nPackages that do report p-values of fixed effects typically using conservative assumptions, large-sample results, or approximate degrees of freedom for a t-distribution\n\nUsing {lmerTest} will produce a summary of {lme4} with pvals for coefficients\n\nParametric Bootstrap can be used to approximate the distribution of the likelihood test statistic and produce more accurate p-values by simulating data under the null hypothesis\n\nModel Comparison\n\nPseudo-R2\n\nSee below in Simple to Complex Model Building

In which case the 10% may actually be pretty normal? Or was the change lower? Higher?\n\nIs this change seasonal? Do we see the same spike around this time each year?\n\nExample: Does WhatsApp see a spike in messages sent during the holiday season?\n\nWas the change sudden or gradual? Did we see a sudden spike or drop overnight? Or has the metric gradually been moving in this direction over time?\n\nExample: If product usage jumps by 50% overnight could there be a bug in our logging systems?\n\nAre there specific times during the day or week where this change is more pronounced?\n\nSolution examples\n\nIf the change is seasonal then there may not necessarily be anything you need to ‘solve’ for. But, you can leverage this to your advantage.\n\nExample: Amazon sales may jump up on Black Friday so they would want to make sure they have the proper infrastructure in place so the site doesn’t crash. They may also see if there are certain types of products that are popular purchases and increase their inventory accordingly.\n\nIf there is a sudden decline, there may be a bug in the logging or a new feature or update recently launched that’s creating problems that you may need to roll back.\nIf there’s a gradual decline, it may indicate a change in user behavior.\n\nExample: If the time spent listening to music is declining because people prefer to listen to podcasts then Spotify may want to focus more of their content inventory on podcasts.\n\n\n\nRegion\n\nWhat to explore\n\nIs this change concentrated in a specific region or do we see a similar change across the board?\n\nSolution examples\n\nThere may be newly enforced regulations in countries that are affecting your product metrics. You would need to do further research to assess the impacts of these regulations and potential workarounds.\n\nExample: Uber was temporarily banned in London in 2019 for repeated safety failures which resulted in a series of lawsuits and court cases.\n\nPopular local events may also be potential explanations. While these may not be areas to ‘solve’ for they can be opportunities to take advantage of.\n\nExample: Coachella season means a jump in the number of Airbnb bookings in Southern California that are capitalized on by surge pricing.\n\n\n\nOther Internal Products\n\nWhat to explore\n\nIs this change specific to one product or is it company-wide? How does this metric vary across our other product offerings?\n\nExample: If the Fundraising feature on Facebook is seeing increased usage, is the swipe up to donate feature on Instagram (which Facebook owns) also seeing a similar uptick?\n\nAre there other metrics that have also changed in addition to the one in question?\n\nExample: If the time spent on Uber is going down, is the number of cancellations by drivers also declining (implying people are spending less time on the app because they’re having a more reliable experience)?\n\n\nSolution examples\n\nIf there is a metric change across our other features and products, it’s likely a larger problem we should address with multiple teams and may need a Public Relations consultant.\n\nExample: Elon + Twitter.\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\nWhat to explore\n\nMobile vs Desktop?\nMac vs Windows?\nAndroid vs iOS?\n\nSolution examples\n\nIf there was a positive change in our metric on a specific platform (e.g. iOS) and coincides with an (iOS) update we released, we would want to do a retrospective to determine what about that update was favorable so we can double down on it. Alternatively, if the metric change was negative, we may want to reconsider and even roll back the update.\nIf the change was due to a change in the platform experience (e.g. app store placement, ratings) we may want to seek advice from our marketing team since this is a top of the funnel problem\nIf users are showing astrong preference for a specific platform, we want to make sure that the experience of the preferred platform is up to par. We also need to make sure our platform-specific monetization strategies are switching to follow the trend.\n\nExample: Facebook’s ad model was initially tied to the desktop app only and had to be expanded as mobile became the platform of preference.\n\n\n\nIndustry & Competitors\n\nWhat to explore\n\nWhen our decline began, was there a new competitor or category that emerged?\n\nExample: Did the number of users listening to Apple podcasts go down when Clubhouse came on to the scene?\n\nHave competitors changed their offering lately?\nIs the category as a whole declining?\n\nSolution examples\n\nIf the category is shifting as a whole, we should begin looking at larger-scale changes to the app.\n\nExample: What Kodak should have done.\n\nIf there’s a new competitor taking our market share, we can begin with reactivation campaigns on churned users. We may also want to conduct user research to understand the gap between our offering and those of our competitors\n\n\nCannibalization\n\nWhat to explore\n\nAre other products or features in our offering experiencing growth in the face of our decline or vice versa?\nHave we released a new feature that is drawing users away from our old features? If so, can we fully attribute the release of the new feature with the decline in the metric of our feature in question?\n\nExample: When Facebook released reactions, did the number of comments on a post go down because people found it easier to press a react button instead of writing a comment?\n\n\nSolution examples\n\nCannibalization may not necessarily be a bad thing. We need to determine whether this shift in user interest across our features is favorable by determining whether the new features align better with the goals of the business.\nCannibalization may also be an indication of but it is indicative of a change in user behavior. In which case we may want to consider if perhaps our core metrics need to change as user behaviors change.\n\nExample: If users care more about watching Instagram stories than engaging with the Instagram feed we may want to optimize for retention (because the ephemeral nature of stories is more likely to motivate users to keep coming back to the platform) instead of time spent on the app.\n\nWe can also look at ways to bridge the two features together to create a more unified platform.\n\n\nSegmentation\n\nWhat to explore\n\nHow does this metric vary by user type:\n\nAge, sex, education\nPower users versus casual users * New users versus existing users\n\nHow does this metric vary by different attributes of the product:\n\nExample: If the time spent watching YouTube videos is going down, is it across longer videos or shorter clips? Is it only for DIY videos or interview tutorial content? Is the same number of people that started watching a video the same but a large chunk of them stop watching it halfway through?\n\n\nSolution examples\n\nIf the metric varies between new and existing users then maybe there is a overcrowding effect.\n\nExample: Reddit forums could hit a critical mass where new users feel lost and less likely to engage than existing users resulting in a drop in engagements per user\n\nIf users are dropping off at certain parts of the funnel then maybe the experience at that funnel step is broken.\n\nExample: While the same number of people are starting carts on Amazon there may be a drop in purchases if the payment verification system isn’t working."

(see Assignment)\nSet the False Positive Rate (typically 5%) (see Experiments, General &gt;&gt; Misc)\nPostulate an effect size and calculate the sample size\n\nFor different evaluation metrics and various minimum detectable effects (MDE), what are the necessary sample sizes for the result to be statistically significant?\n\nVery often we have to retrieve historical data and calculate on our own when the metrics of interest are too specific and are not supported by the A/B test platforms.\n\nChoice of effect size that you want to be able to detect should be meaningful in terms of business value\n\nExperiment Duration & Traffic Portion: This usually depends on the required samples size and the eligible traffic size that could potentially see the new feature.\n\nAlso take into consideration the risks of the experiment.\n\nExperiment Layer & Experiment Type: Determine which experiment layer to deploy our A/B tests.\n\nCommon that most of the experiment layers have been populated with other tests.\n\nOptions: Choose another layer or consider orthogonal experiments, if our feature is not correlated with others.\n\n\n\nCheck A/A variation\n\nMost platforms have automated this process\nCheck the A/A variation output and make sure everything is as expected — the p-values out of A/A simulations are uniformly distributed (Also see links in Terms section)\n\nA/A variation is the difference in key metrics between the control group (group A) and another control group (~group A). Since there is no actual difference between the two, the A/A variation is not expected to deviate from 0 in a statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.0005 recommended) manner. (i.e. any detections are false positives)\n\nPre-treatment A/A (e.g. 60 days): A statistically significant result from the pre-assignment test indicates bias in the A/B test\n\nLikely due to user assignment.\n\ne.g. (user characteristics) A pre-assignment test would uncover that treatment users already had a higher number of purchases even before the experiment.\n\n\nTest under different scenarios: e.g. multiple steps in the conversion funnel (e.g., product impression, click, adding to the shopping cart, and purchase), client-side and server-side experiments, logged-out and logged-in experiments, etc.\nKeep past A/A tests and use them as a baseline Should be performed after any improvement to your experimentation platform\n\nDuring Experiment\n\nCheck the Invariant Metrics & Experiment Set-up\n\nMake sure users in the treatment group see all the treated features as expected\n\nCan be very bad if they aren’t and you’re using the traffic bought by your advertisers for A/B testing but end up sabotaging the experiments due to wrong parameters\n\nCheck that the diversion of traffic is random (also see Assignment section &gt;&gt; SRM Check)\n\nTypically use the Chi-squared Test to check the population across control and treatment groups\n\nCheck that the distribution of user profiles (e.g. gender, age) is homogeneous across treatment/control groups\n\nMost platforms will compute these\n\n\nMonitor Key Evaluation Metrics\n\nIf the key metrics and guardrail metrics drop significantly and continuously, consider taking a step back and re-evaluating the experiment for the benefit of our product and users, as the negative significant results are likely to be just a matter of time\n\nStart doing checks as soon as the experiment launches\n\nCheck regularly for at least the first week for new experiments\n\nNew experiments should be treated like intensive care patients\n**Be aware that the more you test, the greater probability of getting a false positive**\n\nShould apply a multiple-testing correction to the p-value (e.g. bonferoni)\n\nSee Romano-Wolf\n\nSee Statistical Concepts &gt;&gt; Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) &gt;&gt; Romano and Wolf’s correction\nSimilar to Westfall-Young but less restrictive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Experiment - Analyze the Results\n\nCollect the descriptive differences as well as the p-value between the treatment groups and control groups\n\nAlso see\n\nPost-Hoc Analysis, general\nExperiments, Analysis &gt;&gt; A/B Post-Hoc Analysis\nWilcoxon test in notebook and bkmks\n\n\nDo the results align with the hypothesis?\n\nIf they do, delve deeper to understand the reasons by breaking it down into key business dimensions (e.g. new/old users, channels, geographic regions).\n\nIf observed effect is large, it’s more likely that it’s a false positive or something went wrong with the execution of the experiment.\n\nInsignificant results can because of the sample size or high variance in the metrics being measured\n\nFor reducing variance, see Experiments, General &gt;&gt; Decreasing the sampling variance of the treatment effect\n\n\nLook at changes in these secondary metrics to assess if any changes in the primary metric follow the hypothesized causal chain\nIs there additional supporting or refuting evidence?\n\ne.g. consistent patterns across similar variants of the same feature\nIf you test 20 variants and only one yields a significant movement in the primary decision metric, you should be skeptical of that one variant’s positive effect.\n\nWith that 5% false positive rate, we expect on average one significant (1 in 20) result from random chance alone\n\n\nCompare the empirical Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) to the actual difference in key metrics\n\nOften reveals how volatile the metrics are.\nGreat reference when studying user behaviors or designing similar experiments in the future.\n\n\nIf results are mixed/suggestive but not conclusive, run a second A/B experiement based on learnings from the first test\n\nExample: Half of the feature variants had a positive effect, but the other half did not.\n\nRefine these most promising variants, and run a new test\n\nWith fewer variants to test, you can also increase the allocation size to gain more power.\n\nFormulate Product Recommendations\n\nSummarize the analysis of the experiment results\nDerive a product recommendation on whether we should gradually expose more traffic to the treatment or select a more conservative strategy.\n\nWrite the Report\n\nContents\n\nproduct backgrounds and feature hypotheses\nexperiment resign\nresult analysis\nproduct recommendations"

Never do a time split because it violates the identity assumption (i.e. the statistical properties of the control and treatment groups are identical), and the test results are therefore inconclusive\nCookies have a limited life-time which makes it difficult to measure the long-term user impact\n\nSome browsers like Safari’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) delete some cookies after 7 days, so if a test runs for more than a week, then users will be re-assigned after each week.\nEU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) states that website owners must receive explicit user consent before they use any cookies except those that are “strictly necessary” (and it’s hard to argue that A/B testing is strictly necessary to run a service)\n\n\nPotential Issues\n\nAssignment of ineligible users - These may be bots or users that already have an account.\n\nIf we include many ineligible users in our analysis, we may underestimate the effect size even if their distribution across groups is uniform.\n\nCrossovers - These are users that manage to experience both variants.\n\nExample:  Users may come across our site on mobile with the “sign up today!” (exposure) text, and then switch to desktop and see the “sign up” (control) message.\nDepending on the instrumentation we have in place, we may not be able to detect such users, or we may only detect them if they sign up on one device and then log in on the other device.\n\nAssignment without exposure - Due to implementation constraints, we may not be guaranteed that assigned users are actually exposed to the treatment and control.\n\nExample: it may be that the assignment is done on the backend while exposure happens conditionally and asynchronously on the frontend – some users may bounce in the gap between assignment and exposure, and never see the exposure (e.g. call-to-action text, sign up today!“ ).\n\nMultiple exposures - Once a user has been assigned, they may get exposed to the treatment and control multiple times (without crossing over).\n\nExample: Users may visit the landing page repeatedly and see the “sign up” (control) or “sign up today!” (exposure) text multiple times before deciding to sign up.\n\n\nCharacteristics of a good assignment algorithm (Paper)\n\nUsers must be equally likely to see each variant of an experiment (assuming a 50–50 split). There should be no bias toward any particular variant. (i.e. uniform distribution)\n\nCan run a Chi-Square or KS test to compare the random numbers generated (see R in example) to the uniform distribution.\n\nRepeat assignments of a single user must be consistent; the user should be assigned to the same variant on each successive visit to the site.\nWhen multiple experiments are run concurrently, there must be no correlation between experiments. A user’s assignment to a variant in one experiment must have no effect on the probability of being assigned to a variant in any other experiment.\nThe algorithm should support monotonic ramp-up, meaning that the percentage of users who see a Treatment can be slowly increased without changing the assignments of users who were already previously assigned to that Treatment.\n\nExample: Wish AI (article)\n\n\nSteps\n\nConcatenate salt and user ID to get string, S.\n\nSalt is just a string of letters & numbers (e.g. E1F53135E559C253) that gets concantenated to an object to provide an extra layer of security\nUser ID can also be cookie ID, session ID, etc.\n\nApply a Hash function to map the concatenated string, S, to a hash value H. Note, H follows a uniform distribution due to the uniformity property of hash values.\nAssuming the hash function is 64 bit, H is then divided by float(0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) and multiplied by 10,000 to get a uniform random number integer R ranging from 0 to 9,999.\nDivide R by 100. If R/100 &gt;= exposure_rate (e.g., 10%) times 100, we assign ignore to this user, and the user will be excluded in any calculations for this experiment.\nR modulo 100. Assuming there are two experiment buckets: control, treatment. If the remainder is &lt; control bucket percentage (e.g. 50%) time 100, assign control. Otherwise, assign treatment.\n\nOne random number R is generated. The first two digits of R are used for determining exposure, and the last two digits are used for assigning treatment/control buckets. The first two digits and the last two digits of R are independent\n\nSample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) Check\n\n\nMisc\n\nMake sure to use “users” and not “visits” or “sessions” for the check\nDon’t be concerned if early in the experiment, some mismatch occurs\n\nCheck for glaringly large or small ratios\n\ne.g. If you see 1,000 users in one group and 100 in the other, you know there’s a problem\n\nCalculate the sample ratios to check ratios closer to one that might still be a problem\n\ncontrol = users_in_control / total_users_in_test\ntreatment = users_in_treatment / total_users_in_test\n\nTest counts with Chi-Square Test\ngroup_counts &lt;- c(170471, 171662)\np &lt;- c(0.50, 0.50)\nchisq.test(x = group_counts, p = p)\n#&gt; Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n#&gt; data: group_counts\n#&gt; X-squared = 4.146, df = 1, p-value = 0.04173\n\nP-values &lt; 0.01 indicate a SRM\n\nFor this use case, using 0.05 results in too many false positives (see article)\nWe expect the type I error rate (FPR) to be less than 1%\n\n**Be aware that the more you test, the greater probability of getting a false positive**\n\nThe probability of obtaining a false positive using a Chi-squared test configured at the 0.05 level can increase up to 0.14 with as few as five usages\nShould apply a multiple-testing correction to the p-value (e.g. bonferoni)\n\nSee Romano-Wolf correction\n\nSee Statistical Concepts &gt;&gt; Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) &gt;&gt; Romano and Wolf’s correction\nSimilar to Westfall-Young but less restrictive\n\n\n\nTest counts with the sequential SRM test\n\nBayesian method\nSee github for code, blog and paper links"

We can still have any option be the final winner, depending on the order of testing.\n\nBut now some tests are better than others. If we tested all three options at once in an A/B/C test, we’d learn that a plurality of the market prefers X, and we’d learn that there is no option that the market as a whole prefers.\n\n\nPrimacy or Novelty effect\n\nAfter a short time period after implementation, the effect measured in the A/B experiement sharply degrades or grows.\nPrimacy Effect: A new feature is implemented and subgroup of users are reluctant to change. This subgroup may initially use the product less but eventually return to normal usage or ramp up their usage or potentially churn\nNovelty Effect: A new feature is implemented and a subgroup of users who are excited by change begin to use the product more often. This subgroup may initially use the product more but eventually ramp down their usage.\nSince these affects shouldn’t effect first time users, either:\n\nConduct the A/B experiment on first time users, or\nAfter the experiment, investigate by comparing effects of first time users to returning users\n\nA long-run holdout (keeping a small control group for a long period of time) is one way to help capture this over a longer period of time\n\nInterference between variants\n\nCan happen when multiple variants of a feature are being test at the same time\nAssumption of user independence is violated\nCase 1: Social Media\n\nUsers within the same social network influence each other\nIf one user posts in their social media about using a product, then that influences the usage of another user in that person’s social network. If one person is in the experimental group and the other is in the control group, then the experiment is biased\nThis bias dampens the measured effect: actual effect &gt; measured effect\nSolutions:\n\nCreate network clusters and then randomize by cluster\nEgo-network randomization (linkedin, paper)\n\nmore scalable than randomizing by network clusters\nfocal node known as the Ego, and the nodes to whom ego is directly connected to, called Alters, with edges showing links between ego to altars or between altars\nA network effect is said to take place when a new feature not only impacts the people who receive it, but also other users of the platform, like their connections or the people who follow them\n\n\n\nCase 2: Two-sided markets\n\nCompany resources (e.g. people) are finite. Therefore if one variant is popular, then it will consume more company resources which steals resources away from other variant groups.\nUber has a finite amount of drivers. If a feature variant becomes popular before other variants, then more users in that variant group will request more rides which means more drivers will be occupied by that variant group. This reduces driver availability for other variant groups which inflates the effect for first variant to acquire an outsized proportion of the company’s resources.\nThis bias inflates the measured effect for some variants and dampens them in others.\nSolutions:\n\nGeo-based randomization\n\nCompany resources are usually allocated by region. So by splitting variant groups according to region, resources from one region can’t be leached by another region and therefore one feature variant can’t leach resources from another variant\n\nTime-based randomization\n\nSelect a day of the week for each variant to be ran. Since Tuesday’s resources can’t be used on Wednesday, a variant can’t leach resources from another variant\nBest used when treatment effect is short-lived (e.g. surge pricing, not referral programs)\n\n\n\n\nType I error (aka false positive): the models perform equally well, but the A/B test still produces a statistically significant result. As a consequence, you may roll out a new model that doesn’t really perform better. It’s a false positive. You can control the prevalence of this type of error with the p-value threshold. If your p-value threshold is 0.05, then you can expect a Type I error in about 1 in 20 experiments, but if it’s 0.01, then you only expect a Type I error in only about 1 in 100 experiments. The lower your p-value threshold, the fewer Type I errors you can expect.\nType II error (aka false negative): the new model is in fact better, but the A/B test result is not statistically significant. In statistical terms, your test is underpowered, and you should either collect more data, choose a more sensitive metric, or test on a population that’s more sensitive to the change.\nType S error (sign error): the A/B test shows that the new model is significantly better than the existing model, but in fact the new model is worse, and the test result is just a statistical fluke. This is the worst kind of error, as you may roll out a worse model into production which may hurt the business metrics.\nType M error: (magnitude error): the A/B test shows a much bigger performance boost from the new model than it can really provide, so you’ll over-estimate the impact that your new model will have on your business metrics.\nRandom assignment may fail to distribute power users equally: If your user population contains a few users that create a large amount of user activity, then a random A/B assignment is not guaranteed to distribute these users equally. This may violate the identity assumption and make the test results mode difficult to interpret.\nTreatment self-selection: If users themselves can opt into a treatment group, the A/B test violates the identity assumption: the two groups are not identical, but instead the treatment group consists of a particular subset of users, namely those more willing to take part in experiments. In that case we will not be able to tell whether the difference between the groups is due to the treatment or due to the sample differences."

Having user-based instead of session-based metrics means that:\n\nThe results are much less ambiguous in interpretation and can have a much greater impact on decision-making.\nUnlike metrics based on sessions or page views, user-based metrics are as close as possible to independent observations which is a crucial assumption in many statistical tests, thus promoting statistical validity.\n\nFocus on ‘fast-twitch’ metrics, such as those measuring conversion rates or user engagement: this might be a difference between the two groups you can meaningfully measure (and that you know in the long-run is correlated with driving more revenue or more users)\n\nrevenue or the number of users are likely long-run metrics and due to the experiment (e.g. changing the color scheme of your website), it may not possible to produce a measurable effect for one experiment using those metrics\n\nLook at the historical movements of any metric to understand how noisy it is, if it is impacted by seasonality etc.\nUtilize guard-rail metrics to make sure that if your experiment metric is positive that it isn’t similtaneously driving down another important metric.\n\nExample: Recommendation module change cannabalizes usage of other tools\n\nA typical A/B test of a recommendation module commonly involves the change in the underlying machine learning algorithm, its user interface, or both.  The recommendation change significantly increased users’ clicks on the recommendation while significantly decreasing users’ clicks on organic search results.\n\n\nGross Merchandise Sales (GMS)\n\nThere is an intuitive explanation to the drop in search clicks: users might not need to search as much as usual because they could find what they were looking for through recommendations.  In other words, improved recommendations effectively diverted users’ attention away from search and thus cannibalized the user engagement in search.\n\n\nBe careful of divisor metrics\n\nExample: You might see the average daily engagements per active user go up in the variant group, but if the number of users who are actually active in the variant group drops over the testing period because they don’t like the feature, you have a bias that you are only measuring the improvement from the users who continue to remain active Don’t test too many metrics (multiple-testing problem), be selective\nUsing a correction (e.g. Bonferroni) also reduces the power of your experiment\n\nSee Romano-Wolf Correction\n\nSee Statistical Concepts &gt;&gt; Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) &gt;&gt; Romano and Wolf’s correction\nSimilar to Westfall-Young but less restrictive\n\n\nThe correction method should be based on the False Discover Rate (article)"

The proposed test design achieves nearly the same expected regret as the flexible, yet harder-to-implement multi-armed bandit under a wide range of conditions.\nWe [Feit and Berman] demonstrate the benefits of the method in three different marketing contexts—website design, display advertising and catalog tests—in which we estimate priors from past data. In all three cases, the optimal sample sizes are substantially smaller than for a traditional hypothesis test, resulting in higher profit."

    "text": "25.11 Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) Algorithms\n\nCompeting ad designs are viewed as different slot machines each with its own rate of success (conversion). We want to find the slot machine with the best rate and then keep pulling its arm.\nMisc\n\nNotes from\n\nhttps://www.inwt-statistics.com/read-blog/multi-armed-bandits-as-an-a-b-testing-solution.html\n\nPackages\n\n{contextual}\n\n\nA/B Experiment Issues\n\nLarge experimentation costs. Because all the competing treatments in the A/B test are guaranteed a fixed portion of the sample size, even a “bad” treatment can be exposed to a significant amount of users and it could be hurtful to the user experience. A longer experiment means even larger experimentation costs.\nProne to erroneous decisions if not analyzed correctly. The A/B tests are designed to be analyzed only when the targeted sample size is reached. But inexperienced and impatient experimenters are often inclined to peek at results and make decisions before the experiments, which could lead to erroneous conclusions.\n\nMAB Benefits A MAB algorithm will provide a principled way to iteratively adjust the assignment ratio throughout the experiment until the best treatment receives the majority of the sample.\n\nMAB has the advantage of reducing the opportunity costs from the experimentation and is immune to peeking.\n\nEpsilon Greedy (ε-greedy)\n\nAfter an initial number of purely exploratory trials, a random lever is pulled a fraction ε of the time. The rest of the time (1 - ε), the lever with the highest known payoff is pulled.\n\nExample: if we set ε to 0.10, 10% of the time the algorithm will explore random alternatives, and 90% of the time it will exploit the variant that is performing the best.\n\nWe can expand on the ε-greedy algorithm by having it reduce the value of ε over time, thus limiting the possibility of continuing to explore once we’re aware of each lever’s payoff. This is referred to as Decayed Epsilon Greedy.\nThe disadvantage of exploring alternatives randomly is it is possible to run into bad actions that you have already run into before. (solution: UCB)\n\nUpper Confidence Bounds (UCB)\n\nAssumes that the unknown payoff of each lever is as high as the observable data indicate is possible. UCB initially explores randomly to try to get an understanding of the true probability of a lever being successful. Then, the algorithm adds an “exploration bonus” to levers it is unsure about, prioritizing those until it becomes more sure about the lever’s performance. This exploration bonus decreases over each round, similar to the Decayed Epsilon Greedy in that respect.\n\nExample: A person using this algorithm would likely choose one of the restaurants where his reviews have been very different between his different visits. If he has already been to a restaurant four times and the ratings have always been relatively the same non-optimal result, it is very unlikely to be chosen since going to this restaurant for a fifth time would likely produce the same results.\n\nEquations\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&a_t^{\\text{UCB}} = \\text{argmax}_{a \\in A} \\hat Q_t(a) + U_t(a)\\\\\n&\\text{where}\\;\\; U_t(a) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\log t}{N_t(a)}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\\(a\\) - Action\n\\(N_t(a)\\) - The number of times a has been performed at time, t\n\\(\\hat Q_t(a)\\) - ?\n\\(U_t(a)\\) - Exploration bonus at time, t?\nThe more the same action is performed, the more \\(N_t(a)\\) increases and therefore \\(U_t(a)\\) decreases which results in at being less likely to be chosen.\n\n\nThompson Sampling\n\nIt is also possible that a winning lever may initially appear weak, and thus not be explored by a “greedy” algorithm sufficiently enough to determine its true payoff. Thompson Sampling is a Bayesian, non-greedy alternative. In this algorithm, a probability distribution of the true success rate is built for each variant based on results that have already been observed. For each new trial, the algorithm chooses the variant based on a sample of its posterior probability of having the best payout. The algorithm learns from this, ultimately bringing the sampled success rates closer to the true rate."

If we have a mechanism to detect some crossovers, excluding them and comparing the results to the intention-to-treat analysis may uncover implementation bugs.\n\nCrossovers are users that experience both the treatment and control exposures or (unintentionally) more than one treatment\nIt’s worth noting that crossovers shouldn’t occur in cases where we can uniquely identify users at all stages of the experiment – it is a problem that is more likely to occur when dealing with anonymous users.\nAs such, and given the inability to detect all crossovers, A/B experiments should be avoided when users are highly motivated to cross over.\n\nExample: displaying different price levels based on anonymous and transient identifiers like cookies is often a bad idea.\n\n\nAverage Treatement Effect (ATE) - expected causal effect of the treatment across all individuals in the population\n\nOLS estimate, Yi = β0 + β1Xi + ui\n\nβ1 = ATE = E[Y |X = 1] − E[Y |X = 0] = E[β1,i ] = Average effect of a unit change in X\n\nConditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) - ATE for a subgroup\n\nCoefficient for an interaction (e.g. explanatory*treatment)\n\nAlso see Generalized Additive Models (GAM) &gt;&gt; Interactions\n\n\nAverage Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) - expected causal effect of the treatment for individuals in the treatment group ATT = E[δ | D = 1] = E[Y1 − Y0 | D = 1] = E[Y1 | D = 1] − E[Y0 | D = 1]\n\nwhere δ: individual-level causal effect of the treatment and D is the treatment\nIn the ideal scenario of a randomized control trial (RCT) (commonly violated in observational studies), ATE equals ATT because we assume that:\n\nthe baseline of the treatment group equals the baseline of the control group (layman terms: people in the treatment group would do as bad as the control group if they were not treated) and\nthe treatment effect on the treated group equals the treatment effect on the control group (layman terms: people in the control group would do as good as the treatment group if they were treated).\n\nATT should be used instead of ATE when there’s extreme imbalance between covariate criteria of treated vs control/comparison groups (e.g. quasi-experiment)\n\n\nAlso see Econometrics, General &gt;&gt; Propensity Scoring\nOverlap plot or balance plot from video\n\n{cobalt} may provide a way generate these\ny-axis: count, x-axis: covariate, color: treatment\n\nThe range of x covered by blue (treatment) is much smaller than the range of x covered by red (control), therefore ATT might be a better choice of estimated effect\n\n\n\nLocal Average Treatment Effect (LATE) - applies when there is noncompliance in the treatment group, comparison group, or both simultaneously.\n\nIf there is noncompliance in both the treatment and comparison group, then the LATE estimate is valid only for those in the treatment group (who enrolled in the program; i.e. treated) and (who would have not enrolled had they been assigned to the control/comparison group).\n“who would have not enrolled had they been assigned to the comparison group” is a weird counterfactual\n“Local” indicates that LATE is the average effect for the group known as compliers\nTreatment and Instrument are binary variables\n\nIV models still valid for treatments and instruments with more than 2 levels, but effect calculation is more complicated\n\nCalculation (always-takers and defiers are assumed not to exist)\n\nLATE = (avg potential outcome of compliers who do receive treatment) - (avg potential outcome of compliers who don’t receive treatment)\nThe (avg potential outcome of compliers who don’t receive treatment) has to be solved for.\n\nGiven that we know the proportions and outcomes for the compliers and never-takers in our treatment group, you can solve a simple equation for this quantity.\nSee video for details\n\nThink this is the primary estimate of an IV model as well (see Econometrics, General &gt;&gt; Instrumental Variables)\n\nTreatment-on-the-treated (ToT) is simply a LATE in the more specific case when there is noncompliance only in the treatment group. Estimates the difference in outcomes between the units that actually receive the treatment and the comparison group (Seems similar to ATT)\n\nPer-Protocol Effect (PPE) - the effect of receiving the assigned treatment strategies throughout the follow-up as specified in the study protocol\n\ni.e. the effect that would have been observed if all patients had adhered to the protocol of the RCT\nAlternative to the intention-to-treat effect that is not affected by the study-specific adherence to treatment\nValid estimation of the per-protocol effect in the presence of imperfect adherence generally requires untestable assumptions\nApproaches below are generally invalid to estimate the per-protocol effect. (G-estimation and instrumental variable methods can sometimes be used to estimate some form of per-protocol effects even in the presence of unmeasured confounders)\n\n(biased) Approaches:\n\nAs-Treated: Compare the outcomes of those who took treatment (A=1) and didn’t take the the treatment (A=0) regardless of their assignment\n\nPr[Y=1|A=1] − Pr[Y=1|A=0]\n\nPer-Protocol: Compare the outcomes of those who took treatment (A=1) among those assigned to Treatment (Z=1) to those who didn’t take the treatment (A=0) among those assigned to Control (Z=0)\n\nPr[Y=1|A=1, Z=1] − Pr[Y=1|A=0, Z=0].)"

And for that one trial there really could be important differences between the groups at baseline that could lead to errors of inference (e.g. concluding the treatment is beneficial when it isn’t).\nExample: a trial for a blood pressure medication that we hope will lower patients’ SBP values. So we set up the trial, recruit some patients and randomize them into two groups. Then we give one group the new medication we are testing, and the other gets standard-of-care. At the end of the study we compare the mean blood pressure of the two groups and find that the active group had a SBP that was 3 mmHg lower, on average, than the values seen in the control group. We might thus conclude that the treatment worked. However, what if it just so happened that the active group also had a similarly lower mean blood pressure (vs the other group) measured at baseline, before the intervention?\n\nExample: Change Score Model\n\nw1 &lt;- \n  glm(data = dw,\n      family = gaussian,\n      (post - pre) ~ 1 + tx)\nSpecification\n\nWhere\n\npost, pre are pre-treatment, post-treatment measurements of the outcome variable\ntx is the treatment indicator variable\nβ0: population mean for the change in the control group\n\neasier to interpret if “pre” is mean centered\n\nβ1: parameter is the population level difference in pre/post change in the treatment group, compared to the control group.\n\nAlso a causal estimate for the average treatment effect (ATE) in the population, τ"

If this isn’t possible at the individual level, then randomizing at the lowest level possible is the closest, next best thing.\nExample\n\nNetflix: Measure the impact of TV or billboard advertising on member engagement. It is impossible to have identical treatment and control groups at the member level as we cannot hold back individuals from such forms of advertising. Randomize our member base at the smallest possible level. For instance, TV advertising can be bought at TV media market level only in most countries. This usually involves groups of cities in closer geographic proximity.\n\nProblems\n\nsmall sample sizes\n\ne.g. If randomizing by geographical units, there are probably not too many of these\n\nhigh variation and uneven distributions in treatment and control groups due to heterogeneity across units\n\ne.g. London with its high population is randomly assigned to the treatment cell, and people in London love sci-fi much more than other cities. London’s love for sci-fi would result in an overestimated effect.\n\n\nSolutions\n\nrepeated randomizations (aka re-randomization)\n\nkeep randomizing until we find a randomization that gives us the maximum desired level of balance on key variables across treatment cells\nSome problems still remain\n\nCan only simultaneously balance on a limited number of observed variables, and it is very difficult to find identical geographic units on all dimensions\nCan still face noisy results with large confidence intervals due to small sample size\n\n\nImplement designs involving multiple interventions in each treatment cell over an extended period of time whenever possible (i.e. instead of a typical experiment with single intervention period).\n\nThis can help us gather enough evidence to run a well-powered experiment even with a very small sample size. Large amounts of data per treatment cell increases the power of the experiment.\n\nUse a Bayesian Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) to estimate the treatment effect\n\nuses a multivariate structure to analyze more than a single point-in-time intervention in a single region.\ndlm PKG (see bkmks)"

That would be a disaster—type M and S errors will kill you.\nSo, if you expect ahead of time that the study will be summarized by statistical significance or some similar thresholding, then I think it’s a bad idea to do the underpowered study. But if you expect ahead of time that the raw data will be reported and that any summaries will be presented without selection, then the underpowered study is fine.” Gelman\n\n\n\n\n28.3.2 Approximate Sample Size\n\n80% Power\n\nn = 8 / (effect size^2)\n\nYou can substitute correlation (?) for effect size\n\nDifference between means of two groups\n\nn = 32 / (effect size^2)\n\nUsing variance\n\nn = (16* σ2) / δ2\n\nσ is variance of the data (outcome?)\nδ is the effect size\n\n\n\n90% Power\n\nn = 11 / (effect size^2)\n\nBayesian\n\nFrom https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2021-06-01-bayesian-power-analysis/\nBayesian inference is agnostic to any pre-specified sample size and is not really affected by how frequently you look at the data along the way\nA bayesian power analysis to calculate a desired sample size entails using the posterior distribution probability threshold (or another criteria such as the variance of the posterior distribution or the length of the 95% credible interval)\n\nMinimum Detectable Effect (MDE) is proportional to 1/sqrt(sample_size)\nExample: Gelman (Confirming sample size of 126 has 80% power)\n\nAssumption: drug (binary treatment) increased survival rate by 25 percentage points (i.e. treatment effect)\n\nEvidently for a survival model, but Gelman uses standard z-test gaussian power calculation. So, I guess the survival model part doesn’t matter.\n\n“With 126 people divided evenly in two groups, the standard error of the difference in proportions is bounded above by √(0.5*0.5/63 + 0.5*0.5/63) = 0.089, so an effect of 0.25 is at least 2.8 standard errors from zero, which is the condition for 80% power for the z-test.”\n\nSE for the difference in 2 proportions\n\n\nIn the example, the experiment is balanced so both the treatment and control groups have an equal number of participants (i.e. 63 in each group which is a 0.5 proportion of the total sample size)\n\n0.25 / 0.089 = 2.8 s.d. from 0\n\nGelman’s Explanation: “If you have 80% power, then the underlying effect size for the main effect is 2.8 standard errors from zero. That is, the z-score has a mean of 2.8 and standard deviation of 1, and there’s an 80% chance that the z-score exceeds 1.96 (in R, pnorm(2.8, 1.96, 1, lower.tail = F) = 0.8).”\n\nExplanation of the Explanation: “A two-tail hypothesis with a significance level of 0.05 are assumed. The right-tail critical value is 1.96. The power is the mass of the sampling distribution under the alternative to the right of this decision boundary. Then we want to find a Gaussian with a standard deviation of 1 so that 80% of its mass is to the right of 1.96. Then a mean of 2.8 gives the desired outcome.”\nAlso see Notebook pg 95\n\n\n\n\n\n28.3.3 Increasing Power\n\nIncrease the expected magnitude of the effect size by:\n\nBeing bold vs incremental with the hypotheses you test.\nTesting in new areas of the product\n\nLikely more room for larger improvements in member satisfaction\n\n\nIncrease sample size\n\nAllocate more members (or other units) to the test\nReduce the number of test groups\n\nthere is a tradeoff between the sample size in each test and the number of non-overlapping tests that can be run at the same time.\n\n\nTest in groups where the effect is homogenous\n\nincreases power by effectively lowering the variability of the effect in the test population\nNetflix paper\nExample: Testing a feature that improves latency\n\ne.g. the delay between a member pressing play and video playback commencing\nLatency effects are likely to substantially differ across devices and types of internet connections\nSolution: run the test on a set of members that used similar devices with similar web connections\n\n\n\n\n\n28.3.4 {PUMP}\n\nFrequentist Multilevel Model Power/Sample Size/MDE Calculation\nMisc\n\ngithub, paper\n\nalso has vignettes and shiny app\n\nNotes from\n\nVideo useR conference 2022\n\nAssumes multi-test correction procedure (MTP) will occur\nBayesian calculation for this specification would be different\n\nFactors affecting power\n\nWith at least 1 outcome:\n\ndesign of the study;

    "section": "29.1 Misc",
    "text": "29.1 Misc\n\nReasons for not running a RCT\n\nIt’s just not technically feasible to have individual-level randomization of users as we would in a classical A/B test\n\ne.g. randomizing which individuals see a billboard ad is not possible\n\nWe can randomize but expect interference between users assigned to different experiences, either through word-of-mouth, mass media, or even our own ranking systems; in short, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) would be violated, biasing the results\n\nA gold-standard design is a 6-period 2-treatment randomized crossover study; the patient actually receives both treatments and her responses can be compared (Harrell)\nATE for RCT:\n\nNon-theoretical ATE (i.e. calculated from actual data) is sample-averaged; population sampling weights are unavailable for RCT subject groups. So this ATE applies to a replication of the study with similar sampling patterns. ATE does not apply to the population and in fact may apply to no one due to lack of conditioning on patient characteristics. The ATE used in 99% of papers has nothing to do with population but uses only convenience sample weighting.  Some papers even blatantly call it population-averaged.”\n“They test causal hypotheses about a group of patients with symptoms & other ‘diagnostic’ findings that form entry criteria for the RCT & may only be available in sufficient numbers in specialist centres.”\nGelman\n\n“the drug works on some people and not others—or in some comorbidity scenarios and not others—we realize that”the treatment effect” in any given study will depend entirely on the patient mix. There is no underlying number representing the effect of the drug. Ideally one would like to know what sorts of patients the treatment would help, but in a clinical trial it is enough to show that there is some clear average effect. My point is that if we consider the treatment effect in the context of variation between patients, this can be the first step in a more grounded understanding of effect size.\n\nGelman regarding a 0.1 ATE for a treatment in an education study\n\n“Actually, though, an effect of 0.1 GPA is a lot. One way to think about this is that it’s equivalent to a treatment that raises GPA by 1 point for 10% of people and has no effect on the other 90%. That’s a bit of an oversimplification, but the point is that this sort of intervention might well have little or no effect on most people. In education and other fields, we try lots of things to try to help students, with the understanding that any particular thing we try will not make a difference most of the time. If mindset intervention can make a difference for 10% of students, that’s a big deal. It would be naive to think that it would make a difference for everybody: after all, many students have a growth mindset already and won’t need to be told about it.\n“Maybe in some fields of medicine this is cleaner because you can really isolate the group of patients who will be helped by a particular treatment. But in social science this seems much harder.”\n\nMe: So, a 0.1 effect wouldn’t be large if there was no variation (i.e. same size effect for everyone), but that’s very unlikely to be the case.\n\n\n\nCalculation of standard-errors is different depending on the RCT type in order that variation within arms could be validly used to estimate variation between.\nRandom Sampling vs Random Treatment Allocation (source)\n\nRandom Sampling: licenses the use of measures of uncertainty  for (sub)groups of sampled patients.\nRandom Treatment Allocation: licenses the use of measures of uncertainty for the differences between the allocated groups.\n\nRe RCTs:\n\nlicenses the use of measures of uncertainty for hazard ratios, odds ratios, risk ratios, median/mean survival difference, absolute risk reduction etc that measure differences between groups.\nBecause there is no random sampling, measures of uncertainty are not licensed by the randomization procedure for cohort-specific estimates such as the median survival observed in each treatment cohort.\n\nFor those, we can use descriptive measures such as standard deviation (SD), interquartile range etc. Measures of uncertainty will require further assumptions to be considered valid.

    "text": "29.2 RCT Features\n\nThree valuable design features of clinical trials are concurrent control, randomization and blinding.\n\nBlinding is weak at best without Randomization\nRandomization is impossible without Concurrent Control,\nConcurrent Control is necessary for the other two, so it can be regarded as the most important of the three.\n\nBlinding or Masking - patients are unaware of the treatment they are receiving and treating physicians are unaware of the treatment they are administering\n\nPrevents differential care during follow-up, accounts for nonspecific effects associated with receiving an intervention (placebo effects), may facilitate blinding of outcome assessors, and may improve adherence.\n\nConcurrent Control - the effect of a treatment should be assessed by comparing the results of subjects treated with the intervention being studied with the results of subjects treated concurrently (i.e. at the ‘same’ places at the ‘same’ times) with a control treatment, for example, placebo.\n\nIn reality\n\nRe ‘same time’: the idea behind concurrent control is that the times at which they are recruited will vary randomly within treatment arms in the same way as between, so that variation in outcomes arising as a result of the former can be used to judge variation in outcomes as a result of the latter.\n\nTiming matters: The time at which a patient is recruited into the trial matters, but should not be biasing if patients are randomized throughout the trial to intervention and control. It will tend to increase the variance of the treatment effect, and rightly so, but it is a component that may be possible to eliminate (partially) by modelling a trend effect.\n\nExample: 1990s AIDS studies found survival of patients who were recruited later into trials tended to be better than those recruited earlier\n\n\nRe ‘same place’: The vast majority of randomised clinical trials are run in many centers. The variations in design around this many-centers aspect is the primary difference between various types of RCTs (see below). All the types will be regarded as employing concurrent control, but have their standard errors calculated differently.\n\nConsequence of violations\n\nIf variation from center to center is ignored and patients have not been randomized concurrently, then Fisher’s exact test, Pearson’s chi-square and Student’s t will underestimate the variation\n\n\nRandomized assignment means that eligible units are randomly assigned to a treatment or comparison group. Each eligible unit has an equal chance of being selected. This tends to generate internally valid impact estimates under the weakest assumptions.\n\nRandomization also allows us to achieve statistical independence, which eliminates omitted variable bias. Statistical independence implies that the treatment variable is not correlated with the other variables. The key assumption is that randomization effectively produces two groups that are statistically identical with respect to observed and unobserved characteristics. In other words, the treatment group is the same as the control group on average.\n\ni.e. randomization process renders the experimental groups largely comparable. Thus, we can attribute any differences in the final metrics between the experimental groups to the intervention.\n\nIn the absence of randomization, we might fall victim to this omitted variable bias because our treatment variable will probably be endogenous. That is, it will be probably correlated with other variables excluded from the model (omitted variable bias)."

    "text": "29.3 Assignment Options\n\nMisc\n\nIn-Trial Follow-Up (ITFU)\n\nWithout ITFU, the unbiased ascertainment of outcomes may be compromised and statistical power considerably reduced\nStrategies\n\nFace-to-face follow-up is widely used during the initial “in-trial” period, but is costly if employed longer term.\nTelephone-based approaches are more practical, with the ability to contact many participants coordinated by a central trial office\nPostal follow-up has been shown to be effective.\nWeb-based techniques may become more widespread as technological advances develop.\n\n\nPost-Trial Follow-Up (PTFU)\n\nRCTs are costly and usually involve a relatively brief treatment period with limited follow-up. A treatment response restricted to this brief “in-trial” period can potentially underestimate the long-term benefits of treatment and also may fail to detect delayed hazards.\nStrategies\n\nSee ITFU strategies\nUse of routine health records can provide detailed information relatively inexpensively, but the availability of such data and rules governing access to it varies across countries.\n\n\n\nRandomization\n\nIndividual Randomization - the individual or patient that is allocated to an intervention (may be more than one intervention group) or control group, and simple statistical analyses on participant outcomes are used to evaluate if the intervention was effective.\n\nThese analyses assume that all participants are completely independent (ie. unlike each other, do not influence each other, and any outcomes measured on them are influenced by the intervention or usual care in the same way)\n\nCluster Randomization - is one in which intact social units, or clusters of individuals rather than individuals themselves, are randomized to different intervention groups\n\nAll participants recruited from the practice, school or workplace are allocated to either the intervention or the control group\nThe outcomes of the intervention are still measured at the individual level, but the level at which the comparison is made is the practice, school or workplace\nAdvantages\n\nMembers from intervention and control groups are less likely to have direct contact with each other and are less likely to pass on components of the intervention to the control group. (i.e. contamination)\nThere may also be increased compliance due to group participation.\nClusters typically consistent in their management.\n\n\n\nTreatment Strategy\n\nParallel Group - subjects are randomized to one or more study arms (aka treatment groups) and each study arm will be allocated a different intervention. After randomization each participant will stay in their assigned treatment arm for the duration of the study\n\nThink this is just typical randomization into treatment/control groups but can be extended to include multiple treatment arms.\n“change from baseline” (aka change scores) should never be the outcome variable\nCentral Question: For two patients with the same pre measurement value of x, one given treatment A and the other treatment B, will the patients tend to have different post-treatment values of y?\n\nCrossover Group - subjects are randomly allocated to study arms where each arm consists of a sequence of two or more treatments given consecutively.\n\ni.e. each subject receives more than one treatment and each treatment occurs sequentially over the duration of the study.\nExample: AB/BA study - Subjects allocated to the AB study arm receive treatment A first, followed by treatment B, and vice versa in the BA arm.\nAllows the response of a subject to treatment A to be contrasted with the same subject’s response to treatment B.\n\nRemoving patient variation in this way makes crossover trials potentially more efficient than similar sized, parallel group trials in which each subject is exposed to only one treatment.\n\nIn theory treatment effects can be estimated with greater precision given the same number of subjects.\nMisc\n\nBest practice is to avoid this design if there is a reasonable chance of Carry Over\nAlso see\n\nSenn SJ. Cross-over trials in clinical research. Chichester: John Wiley; 1993.\n\n“readable approach to the problems of designing and analysing crossover trials”\n\n\n\nIssue: Carry Over\n\nEffects of one treatment may “carry over” and alter the response to subsequent treatments.\n(Pre-experiment) Solution: introduce a washout (no treatment) period between consecutive treatments which is long enough to allow the effects of a treatment to wear off.\n\nA variation is to restrict outcome measurement to the latter part of each treatment period. Investigators then need to understand the likely duration of action of a given treatment and its potential for interaction with other treatments.\n\nTesting for Carry Over\n\nIf carry over is present the outcome on a given treatment will vary according to its position in the sequence of treatments.\nExample: Concluding that there was no carry over when an analysis of variance found no statistically significant interaction between treatment sequence and outcome.1\nHowever such tests have limited power and cannot rule out a type II error (wrongly concluding there is no carry over effect).\n\n(Post-experiment) Solution: If Carry Over is detected:\n\nOption 1: Treat the study as though it were a parallel group trial and confine analysis to the first period alone.\n\nThe advantages of the crossover are lost, with the wasted expense of discarding the data from the second period.\nMore importantly, the significance test comparing the first periods may be invalid\n\nOption 2 (applicable only to studies with at least three treatment periods, e.g. ABB/BAA)\n\nModel the carry over effect and use it to adjust the treatment estimate.\nSuch approaches, while statistically elegant, are based on assumptions which can rarely be justified in practice.\nSee Senn paper above\n\n\n\n\nBlocked Randomization - at any given point in the trial we restrict the degree of “imbalance” between the groups to half of the block size\n\nImbalance leads to a loss of power\nIn an open-label study, a small fixed block size would make it possible for the study staff to predict what the next allocation is.\n\nSolution: Use variable block sizes, which retain some of the protection of balanced group size while making it harder for the study staff to tell where they are in a given block or where one block ends and another begins\n\nTwitter thread presenting an example of the procedure for a block randomized RCT\n\nBalance - balanced allocations are more efficient in that they lead to lower variances\n\nVariance of the Mean difference (e.g between treatment and control groups) for unbalanced design\n\n\nRandomized designs are classified as completely randomized design, complete block design, randomized block design, Latin square design, split pot design, cross over design, family block design, stepped-wedge cluster design, etc.\n\nCompletely Randomized Parallel Group trial - any given center will have some patients randomly allocated to intervention and some to control. Randomization includes centers (i.e. a patient is randomly selected either treatment/control and which center they will receive the treatment)\n\nParallel Group Blocked by Center - Randomization happens within each center (i.e. each center handles their own randomization). Treatment/Control ratio is the same for each center.\n\n“Center” should be included as a variable in the model.\n\n\nCluster-Randomized trial - randomly allocate some centers to dispense the intervention and some the control\n\nFundamental unit of inference becomes the center and patients are regarded as repeated measures on it\n\n\nExamples\n\nThe effects of a leading mindfulness meditation app (Headspace) on mental health, productivity, and decision-making (Paper)\n\nRCT with 2,384 US adults recruited via social media ads.\nFour-week experiment\n\nfirst group is given free access to the app (worth $13)\nsecond group receives, in addition, a $10 incentive to use the app at least four or ten separate days during the first two weeks\nthird group serves as a (waitlist) control group"

Each site will include six patients per week [the “per week” just means each site will have 6 total subjects participating each week as part of control or later in the treatment]. That means if we are collecting data for all sites over the entire study period, we will have 24×6×50=7200 outcome measurements.\nIn the stepped-wedge design, all clusters [I think the clusters are the “waves”] in a trial will receive the intervention at some point, but the start of the intervention will be staggered. The amount of time in each state (control or intervention) will differ for each site (or group of sites if there are waves of more than one site starting up at the same time).\nIn this design (and in the others as well) time is divided into discrete data collection/phase-in periods. In the schematic figure, the light blue sections are periods during which the sites are in a control state, and the darker blue are periods during which the sites are in the intervention state. Each period in this case is 4 weeks long.\nFollowing the Thompson et al. paper, the periods can be characterized as pre-rollout (where no intervention occurs), rollout (where the intervention is introduced over time), and post-rollout (where the all clusters are under intervention). Here, the rollout period includes periods two through five.\nStepped Wedge with Rollout-Only\n\n\n\nThe Thompson et al. paper argued that if we limit the study to the rollout period only (periods 2 through 5 in the example above) but increase the length of the periods (here, from 4 to 6 weeks), we can actually increase power. In this case, there will be one wave of 10 sites that never receives the intervention.\nThe data generation process is exactly the same as above, except the statement defining the length of periods (6 weeks instead of 4 weeks) and starting point (week 0 vs. week 4) is slightly changed\nStepped wedge with rollout maintains power best as the inter-class correlation (ICC) increases between sites\n[](./_resources/Experiments,_Stepped_Wedge_Cluster_Design.resources/unknown_filename.2.png|812x0]]\nStepped Wedge vs. Cluster Randomized Trial (CRT)\n\n\nCRT is a traditional parallel design unlike the stepped design that’s been discussed\nThe simulations confirm findings that the CRT is more efficient than stepped-wedge designs when the ICC is close to zero, but pales in comparison even with ICCs as low as 0.01.\n\n\nIntra-cluster correlation (ICC) across time periods(https://www.rdatagen.net/post/intra-cluster-correlations-over-time/) [bkmk in design]\n\nMoving beyond the parallel design (CRT design above) to the stepped-wedge design, time starts to play a very important role. It is important to ensure that we do not confound treatment and time effects; we have to be careful that we do not attribute the_general_changes over time to the intervention. This is accomplished by introducing a time trend into the model. (Actually, it seems more common to include a time-specific effect [dummy vars for each period I assume] so that each time period has its own effect. However, for simulation purposes, I will assume a linear trend.)\nIn the stepped-wedge design, we are essentially estimating within-cluster treatment effects by comparing the cluster with itself pre- and post-intervention. To estimate sample size and precision (or power), it is no longer sufficient to consider a single ICC, because there are now multiple ICC’s - the within-period ICC and the between-period ICC’s. The within-period ICC is what we defined in the parallel design [standard ICC definition in my notebook](since we effectively treated all observations as occurring in the same period.) Now we also need to consider the expected correlation of two individuals in the same cluster in different time periods.\nIf we do not properly account for within-period ICC and the between-period ICC’s in either the planning or analysis stages, we run the risk of generating biased estimates.\nSide note: according to the standard ICC equation, we can say that correlation between any two subjects in a cluster increases as the variation between clusters increases\n\nModeling\n\nTraditional parallel clustered design(e.g. CRT above) mixed model\n\n(https://www.rdatagen.net/post/intra-cluster-correlations-over-time/)\n\n, where  y_ic is a continuous outcome for subject i in cluster c, and X_c is a treatment indicator for cluster c (either 0 or 1). The underlying structural parameters are μ, the grand mean, andβ1, the treatment effect. The unobserved random effects are b_c∼ N(0,σ_b^2), the normally distributed group level effect, and e_ic ∼ N(0, σ_e^2), the normally distributed individual-level effect. (This is often referred to as the “error” term, but that doesn’t adequately describe what is really unmeasured individual variation.)\n\n\nConstant (and equal) ICCs over time\n\nAssumes that the within-period ICC and between-period ICC’s are equal and constant throughout the study\n\nThe key differences between this model compared to the parallel design is the time trend and time-dependent treatment indicator. The time trend accounts for the fact that the outcome may change over time regardless of the intervention. And since the cluster will be in both the control and intervention states we need to have an time-dependent intervention indicator.\nWithin- and between- period ICC is\n\nBetween-period ICC means we are estimating the expected correlation between any two subjects i and j in cluster c, one in time period t and the other in time period t’ where (t≠t′). So correlations are being calculated between all pair-wise combinations of the periods. Not just between t and t+1 but also t and t+2, etc.\n(https://www.rdatagen.net/post/estimating-treatment-effects-and-iccs-for-stepped-wedge-designs/)\n\n\n\n- library(lme4)\n- lmerfit &lt;- lmer(Y ~ period + rx + (1| cluster) , data = dx)\n- vars &lt;-as.data.frame(VarCorr(lmerfit))$vcov\n- iccest &lt;- round(vars[1]/(sum(vars)), 3)\n\nDifferent within- and between-period ICCs\n\n(https://www.rdatagen.net/post/varying-intra-cluster-correlations-over-time/)\nInstead of a single cluster level effect, b_c, we have a vector of correlated cluster/time specific effects, b_ct.The vector b_c has a multivariate normal distribution N(0,(σ_b^2)*R). These cluster-specific random effects, (b_c1, b_c2, …, b_cT) [I think T is the number of periods] replace b_c, and the slightly modified data generating model is\n\nHow we specify r_0 and r reflects different assumptions about the between-period intra-cluster correlations.\n  (see b_ct distribution specification above)\nWithin-period ICC is still the same\n\n, but the between-period ICC is\n\n\n\nCase 1: In this first case, the correlation between individuals in the same cluster but different time periods is less than the correlation between individuals in the same cluster and same time period. In other words, ICC_tt != ICC_tt’ [what’s described is actually ICC_tt &gt; ICC_tt’ but that still follows them being “not equal.”]. However the between-period correlation isconstant,  or in other words, ICC_tt′ are constant for all t and t′. [So the correlation between individuals within-period is different than between-period but the between-period correlation is the equal for each pair of periods].

Because the loss function is calculated based on the squared errors, it is more sensitive to the larger deviations associated with tail events\n\n\nHeavy tails\n\nYour random variable distribution is heavy tailed if:\n\n\n\nwhere the exponential survival function,  \nSays if you take the ratio of your most extreme positive values (i.e. your survival function) at the tail (i.e. supremum)(numerator) and those of the positive tail of exponential survival function (denominator), then that ratio will go to positive infinity as x goes to infinity\nOr in other words, the probability mass of the pdf of your random variable in the tail is greater than the probability mass that of the exponential pdf\nAlso means that the moment generating function is equal to infinity which means that it can’t be used to calculate distribution parameters\n\n\nSubsets of heavy tails\n\nAlong with survival function ratio (see above), these tails have additional conditions \nlong tails\n\ncommon in finance\nYour random variable distribution is long tailed if:\n\nit follows the explosion principle\n\nIf an extreme event manifests itself, then the probability of an even more extreme event approaches 1\n\nno time prediction on the next more extreme event but extreme value theory + timeseries + conditions say extreme events tend to cluster\n\n\nSays, for example, if you take a huge loss in your portfolio, it’s a mistake to think that that value is an upper bound on losses or that the probability of an even larger loss is negligible\n\nNot practical to determine from data\n\nsubexponential tails\n\nsubset of long tail\nYour random variable distribution is subexponential tailed if:\n\nit follows the one-shot aka catastrophe principle aka “winner takes all”\n\n\n\nwhere Sn is a partial sum of values of your random variable; Mn is a partial maximum; x is a large value\nsays at some point the partial sum, Sn , will be dominated by one large value, Mn\nExample: if your portfolio follows this principle, then your total loss can be mostly attributed to one large loss\n\n\ntools available to practically test\n\nExamples:\n\nlog-normal\n\ncan get normal parameters from lognormal parameters by formula that involves exponentiation (see notebook) or vice versa with logs\nall statistical moments always exist\n\n\nfat tails\n\n\n\nL(x) is just characterized as slowly varying function that gets dominated by the decaying inverse power law element, x-α. as x goes to infinity\nα is a shape parameter, aka “tail index” aka “Pareto index”\n\nExamples\n\npareto\n\npareto has similar relationship with the exponential distribution as lognormal does with normal\n\n\nxm is the (positive) minimum of the randomly distributed pareto variable, X that has iindex α\nYexp is exponentially distributed with rate α\n\nsome theoretical statistical moments may not exist\n\nIf the theoretical moments do not exist, then calculating the sample moments is useless\nExample: Pareto (α = 1.5) has a finite mean and an infinite variance\n\nNeed α &gt; 2 for a finite variance\nNeed α &gt; 1 for a finite mean\nIn general you need α &gt; p for the pth moment to exist\nIf the nth moment is not finite, then the (n+1)th moment is not finite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight tails\n\nOpposite of heavy\nInstead of larger than pdf or survival function of the exponential version, it’s equal to or smaller than.\n\ni.e. your function decays as fast or faster as x goes to infinity as an exponential\n\nExamples\n\nexponential, normal\n\n\nBoth\n\nclass depends on parameter values\nExamples\n\nWeibull\n\n\n\n\n\nTests\n\nNotes\n\nAll the plots below should be used and considered when diagnosing tails\nCan use the zipf and me plots to find the thresholds in the data where it would be useful to start modeling the data as pareto or lognormal\n\nAsk these questions\n\nDoes the subject matter you’re modeling lead you to expect a certain type of tail?\n\nExample: Does the explosion principle hold or not?\n\nIs there an upper bound to your data (theoretical or actual)?\n\nExample: Is the upper bound due to the quality of the data\n\nDo I have over 10,000 observations?\n\nIn the various plots below, it can be difficult to distinguish between Pareto (fat tail) and Lognormal (long tail) distributions. As a rule-of-thumb, usually takes 10K observations to really be able to tell the two apart in order to get enough data points in the tail.\nUsually get at least 10K observations in a market risk portfolio, but not in credit risk or operational risk portfolios\n\n\nQ-Q plot\n\nexponential quartiles on the y-axis and ordered data on the x-axis\n\nSee EDA &gt;&gt; Numeric &gt;&gt; Q-Q plot for code\n\nif data hugs the diagonal line –&gt; exponential –&gt; light tails\nif data is concave –&gt; potentially heavy tails\nif data is convex –&gt; potentially tails that are lighter than an exponential\n\nZipf plot\n\nlog-log plot of the empirical survival function of the data\n\nlog of the pareto survival function makes it linear where the slope of the line is -α\n\nindicates if there’s a power law decay in the tails of the data (i.e. fat tails)\n\nresults of this plot is “necessary” but not “sufficient” for confirmation of fat tails (pareto)\nIt is sufficient to say it’s not a pareto if there’s curvature\n\n\n\n\nThe real data shows linearity at the very end, so even though it’s not linear from the beginning, it is still potentially fat tailed\n\nReal data often show mixed, complex behaviors.\n\nAlso not that even in the simulated dataset, the data points at the end have some randomness to them and don’t fall directly on the line.\n\nthe randomness is called small sample bias; usually not much data in the tails\n\n\n\n\nlog-normal can look like a pareto if its sigma parameter is large (small data). It will look linear and curve down at the very end.\nExample above shows lognormal with sd = 1, so sd doesn’t have to be very large to be tricky to discern from a Pareto.\nIf the data has a smallish range (x-axis), then that is a signal to wary about deeming the distribution to having fat tails\n\nThis one goes from 0 to 100 while the one above it goes from 0 to a million\n“Large” or “small” depends on the type of data your looking at though. In another subject matter, maybe 100 is considered large, so context matters\n\n\n\n\nCompare slopes between your original data (red) and aggregations of your data in a zipf plot; If you have fat tails, the line will be shifted because of aggregation but the slope, α, will remain the same\n\nExamples of aggregation methods (halves the sample size)\n\nOrder data from largest to smallest; add a1 + an, a2 + an-1, …; plot alongside original data (green)\nOrder data from largest to smallest; add a1 + a2, a3 + a4, …; plot alongside original data (blue)\n\n\n\n\nMean Excess (ME) plot\n\nCalculating the empirical mean excess variable - Order the data, calc mean2, remove the 1 data point, calc mean2, remove data points 1 and 2, calc mean3, and so on. Then plot the means\n\n\nlognormal is similar to pareto in this plot as well. The more data you have the easier it will be to distinguish the two.\nThe left equation is for the lognormal curve (with Normal parameters) and the right equation is the pareto\n\nNeed α &gt; 1, so that the mean is finite\n\n\n\n\nDisregard last few points (small sample bias)\nPoints in green circles (only a few points in tails, so difficult to be confident about)\n\nleft: shows a straight line\nright: concave down\n\nRight plot: curvature at the beginning common in the wild, since you’re not likely dealing with pure distributions but some kind of noisy mixture\n\n\nMaximum to sum plot (MS Plot)\n\n\nS is the partial sum, M is the partial maximum, p is the order of the moment that you want to see if it exists or not\n\nFor lognormal, all moments always exist\nFor pareto, you usually only need to check up to p = 4 or p = 5\n\nFor higher levels of p (and hence α) the pareto distribution begins to act like a normal\nUsually in credit, market, or operational risk markets you’re dealing with pareto 0 &lt; α &lt;= 3\n\n\nProcedure\n\nchoose a p that you want to check\nfor each n, calculate the sum, maximum, and ratio\ny-axis is the ratio, x-axis is the n value\n\n\n\nA lognormal will always converge to 0 for every p you check (black line)\nWhen a moment doesn’t exist (i.e. infinite), it just oscillates and never converges (orange line)\nMS plots always start at 1\nPotentially with fewer than 100 observations, you could start to see a convergence if one is going to happen. Of course hundreds of observations is better. Point is that it doesn’t take thousands.\n\nLeft - credit data (real estate losses), Right - operational loss data\n\n\n\nLeft\n\np = 1 definitely exists; p = 2 is iffy; p = 3,4 don’t exist\nInterpretation: either α is between 1 and 2 or there aren’t enough observations to show a convergence\n\nAlthough n is pretty large in this case\n\n\nRight\n\np = 1 is iffy, the rest don’t exist\nInterpretation: α might be less than 1\n\n\n\n\nConcentration Profile\n\nRequirements\n\ndata &gt;= 0 and mean is finite\n\nSimilar to the Mean Excess plot, except the gini index is computed instead of the mean\n\n\nIn the wild you can expect mixtures, so there will likely be noisy behavior in the beginning and when the fat tail is reached, a flat line is formed"

If the layers become larger/smaller, your vectors will too.\n\nUse another extraction method: In the event of the model not changing, you can still try several embedding extraction methods and compare between them.\n\nRetraining your model: Once you retrain the model from which you extract the embeddings, the parameters that define it will change. Hence, the values of the components of the vectors will change as well.\nVision\n\nUnique situations, events, people or objects that are observed in production data but are missing from the training set\n\nText\n\nWhen a word, category or language that does not exist in the training data emerges in production\nAny changes in terminology in the data or changes to the context or meaning of words or phrases over time can contribute to drift.\n\nLow-resource languages and cultural gaps in speech can also compound these difficulties\n\nExample: a sentiment classification model trained on apparel product reviews in English but in production, encounters reviews in Spanish for the first time\n\nOr is asked to predict the sentiment of reviews of specialized medical devices.\n\n\n\nExtraction Methods\n\nExtract embeddings from the current model in production.\n\nExtracting the last fully connected layer before the classification to create an image embedding is advisable.\n\nThe latent structure in this layer will contain information about structure in the image such as objects and actions, in addition to general quality information relative to images in the training set\n\nIn the case of a vision transformer (ViT), it is recommended that you extract the embedding that the multilayer perceptron (MLP) is acting on to make an image-level decision\nExample on how to extract embeddings from a well-known Hugging Face model (article)\n\nUsing a model to extract the embedding\n\ne.g. a foundational model like BERT\nAdvantages\n\nNo modification is needed on the production model\nEasy option for testing and running on internal data.\n\nDisadvantage: the model is only looking at the data itself and is not looking at the internal model decisions.\n\n\nChoose a reference vector or dataset\n\nFormulate an expectation on how stable or volatile your data is and choose the reference data that adequately captures what you expect to be a “typical” distribution of the input data and model responses.\nExamples\n\nValidation data\nPast period that you consider representative\n\ne.g. this week’s data to the previous week and move the reference as you go.\n\n\n\nMetrics\n\nWhichever metric you choose, it will need to be tuned. To tune it, you can model your drift detection framework using historical data or, alternatively, start with some sensible default and then adjust it on the go.\nEuclidean distance\n\nSmaller the distance, the more similar the embeddings\n\nRange: 0 to ∞\n\nMore stable, sensitive and scalable compared to hyperbox IOU, euclidean distance, cosine distance, and clustering-based group purity scores.\nAn absolute measure which makes setting a specific drift alert threshold harder: the definition of “far” will vary based on the use case and the embedding model used. You need to tune the threshold individually for different models you monitor.\nCalculate centroid for embedding vectors in the production model (and baseline model)\n\nNote: vertical dots are missing in the vectors\nThe centroid is calculated by taking the row-wise averages\n\nCompare production centroid to baseline centroid\n\nCosine Distance (1 - cosine similarity)\n\n\nSmaller the distance, the more similar the embeddings\nIf the two distributions are the same, the Cosine similarity will be 1, and the Cosine distance will be 0. The distance can take values from 0 to 2.\nThe threshold might be not very intuitive to tune, since it can take values as low as 0.001 for a change that you already want to detect.\nAnother downside is that it does not work if you apply dimensionality reduction methods like PCA, leading to unpredictable results.\n\nModel-based drift detection\n\nTrain a classification model that tries to identify to which distribution each embedding belongs and use the AUROC as the drift score.\nIf the model can confidently predict from which distribution the specific embedding comes, it is likely that the two datasets are sufficiently different.\n\ni.e. An AUROC score above 0.5 shows at least some predictive power, and an AUROC score of 1 corresponds to “absolute drift” when the model can always identify to which distribution the data belongs.\n\nWorks consistently for different datasets and embedding models we tested, both with and without PCA. It also has an intuitive threshold\n\nShare of drifted components\n\n\nThe individual components of each embedding are treated as “columns” in a structured dataset.\nCompute the drift in each component.\n\ne.g. Wasserstein (Earth-Mover) distance with the 0.1 threshold. The intuition behind this metric is that when you set the threshold to 0.1, you will notice changes in the size of the “0.1 standard deviations” of a given value.\n\nMeasure the overall share of drifting components.\n\ne.g. if your vector length is 400, you can set the threshold to 20%. If over 80 components drift, you will get a drift detection alert.\n\nAllows you to reuse familiar techniques that you might be using to detect drift on tabular data.\nMore tuning parameters than other methods: underlying drift detection method, its threshold, and the share of drifting components to react to.\n\n\nUse the 2-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (KS)\n\n“Multiple samples from the embedding set can be taken calculating the euclidean distance metric for each sample set separately, and the KS test can be used to determine if drift has or hasn’t occurred.”\nSee Distributions &gt;&gt; Tests for more details"

Effect will be overestimated and the CI too narrow\nAdjusting for the effect of a confounding variable, dichotomisation will run the risk that a substantial part of the confounding remains\n\n\nHarrell\n\nThink most of these issues are related to inference models like types of logistic regression\nA better approach that maximizes power and that only assumes a smooth relationship is to use a restricted cubic spline (regression spline; piecewise cubic polynomial) function for predictors that are not known to predict linearly. Use of flexible parametric approaches such as this allows standard inference techniques (P -values, confidence limits) to be used (See Feature Engineering, Splines)\nIssues with binning continuous variables\n\nIf cutpoints are chosen by trial and error in a way that utilizes the response, even informally, ordinary P -values will be too small and confidence intervals will not have the claimed coverage probabilities.\n\nThe correct Monte-Carlo simulations must take into account both multiple tests and uncertainty in the choice of cutpoints.\n\nUsing the “minimum p-value approach” often results in multiple cutpoints so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ plus multiple testing p-value adjustments need to be used.\n\nThis approach involves testing multiple cutpoints and choosing one that minimizes the p-value below a threshold.\n\nOptimal cutpoints often change from sample to sample\nThe optimal cutpoint for a predictor would necessarily be a function of the continuous values of all the other predictors\nYou’re losing variation (information) which causes a loss of power and precision\nAssumes that the relationship between the predictor and the response is flat within each interval\n\nthis assumption is far less reasonable than a linearity assumption in most cases\n\nPercentiles\n\nUsually estimated from the data at hand, are estimated with sampling error, and do not relate to percentiles of the same variable in a population\nValue of binned variable potentially takes on a different relationship with the outcome\n\ne.g. Body Mass Index has a smooth relationship with every outcome studied, and relates to outcome according to anatomy and physiology. Binning may change that relationship to being how many subjects have a similar BMI.\n\n\nMany bins usually required to make it worth it. Therefore, many dummy variables will end up being created resulting in a loss of power and precision. (i.e. more bins = more variables = more dof used)\nPoor predictive performance with Cox regression models\n\n\nThey might help with prediction using ML or DL models though\n\n“Instead of directly using marketplace health as a continuous feature, we decided to use a form of target-encoding by splitting up the metric into buckets and taking the average historical delivery duration within that bucket as the new feature.

If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger than others, it might dominate the objective function and make the estimator unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.\n\nMost Clustering methods require it\nPCA can only be interpreted as the singular value decomposition of a data matrix when the columns have centered\nInterpreting the intercept as the mean of the outcome when all predictors are held at their means\nPredictors with large values (country populations) can have really small regression coefficients. Standardization makes the coefficients have a more managable scale.\nSome types of models are more numerically stable with the predictors have been standardized\nEasier to set priors in Bayesian modeling\nCentering fixes collinearity issues when creating powers and interaction terms\n\nCollinearity between the created terms and the main effects\n\n\nOther Reasons why you might want to:\n\nCreating a composite score\n\nWhen you’re trying to sum or average variables that are on different scales, perhaps to create a composite score of some kind. Without scaling, it may be the case that one variable has a larger impact on the sum due purely to its scale, which may be undesirable.\nOther Examples:\n\nResearch into children’s behavioral disorders - researchers might get ratings from both parents & teachers, & then want to combine them into a single measure of maladjustment.\nStudy on the activity level at a nursing home w/ self-ratings by residents & the number of signatures on sign-up sheets for activities\n\n\nTo simplify calculations and notation.\n\nA sample covariance matrix of values that has been centered by their sample means is simply X′X (correlation matrix)\nIf a univariate random variable, X, has been mean centered, then var(X)=E(X2) and the variance can be estimated from a sample by looking at the sample mean of the squares of the observed values.\n\n\nReasons NOT to standardize\n\nWe don’t want to standardize when the value of 0 is meaningful.\n\nscale(var or matrix)\n\nDefault args: center = T, scale = T\nStandardizes each column of a matrix separately\nFYI scale(var) == scale(scale(var))\n\n{datawizard::standardize} - Can center by median and scale by MAD (robust), can scale by 2sd (Gelman)\n{{sklearn::RobustScaler}}\n\nStandardize by median and IQR instead of mean and sd\n\n(value − median) / IQR\n\nThe resulting variable has a zero mean and median and a standard deviation of 1, although not skewed by outliers and the outliers are still present with the same relative relationships to other values.\nstep_normalize has means, sd args, so it might be able to do this\n\nHarrell recommends substituting the gini mean difference for the standard deviation\n\nGini’s mean difference - the mean absolute difference between any two distinct elements of a vector.\n\n\nHmisc::GiniMd(x, na.rm = F) (doc)\nsjstats::gmd(x or df, ...)

If they are outliers, then the range of your data will be more constricted that it needs to be.\n\ne.g. if values are in between 100 and 500 with an exceptional value of 25000, then 25000 is scaled as 1 and all the other values become very close to the lower bound of zero\n\nExample: Age is the predictor and Happiness is the outcome. Imagine a very strong relationship between age and happiness, such that happiness is at its maximum at age 18 and its minimum at age 65. It’ll be easier if we rescale age so that the range from 18 to 65 is one unit. Now this new variable A ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is age 18 and 1 is age 65. (from Statistical Rethinking section 6.3.1 pg 182)\nd2 &lt;- d[ d$age&gt;17 , ] # only adults\nd2$A &lt;- ( d2$age - 18 ) / ( 65 - 18 )\n\nRange: [a, b]\n\nAlso see notebook for code to transform more than 1 variable at a time.\n\nBy max\nscaled_var = var/max(var)\n\nExample: From Statistical Rethinking, pg 246\n\n“… zero ruggedness is meaningful. So instead terrain ruggedness is divided by the maximum value observed. This means it ends up scaled from totally flat (zero) to the maximum in the sample at 1 (Lesotho, a very rugged and beautiful place).”\n\nExample: From Statistical Rethinking, pg 258\n\n“I’ve scaled blooms by its maximum observed value, for three reasons. First, the large values on the raw scale will make optimization difficult. Second, it will be easier to assign a reasonable prior this way. Third, we don’t want to standardize blooms, because zero is a meaningful boundary we want to preserve.”\n\nblooms is bloom size. So there can’t be a negative but zero makes sense.\nblooms is 2 magnitudes larger than both its predictors.\n\n\n\nBy mean\nscaled_var = var/mean(var)\n\nExample: From Statistical Rethinking, pg 246\n\n“log GDP is divided by the average value. So it is rescaled as a proportion of the international average. 1 means average, 0.8 means 80% of the average, and 1.1 means 10% more than average.”\n\n\n\n\n\nLogging\n\nUseful for skewed variables\nIf you have zeros, then its common to add 1 to the predictor values\n\nTo backtransform: exp(logged_predictor) - 1\narcsinh(x): approximates a log (at large values of x) but handles 0s:\n\nBacktransform: log(x + sqrt(1+x^2))\n\n* Don’t use these for outcome variables (See Regression, Other &gt;&gt; Zero-Inflated/Truncated &gt;&gt; Continuous for methods, Thread for discussion and link to a paper on the alternatives)\n\nThe scale of the outcome matters. The thread links to a discussion of a paper on log transforms.\nProposals in the paper are in Section 4.1. One of the recommendations is log(E[Y(0)] + Y) where (I think) E[Y(0)] is the average value of Y when Treatment = 0 but I’m not sure. Need to read the paper.\n\n\nRemember to back-transform predictions if you transformed the target variable\n# log 10 transformed target variable\npreds_intervals &lt;- predict(\n  workflows::pull_workflow_fit(lm_wf),\n  workflows::pull_workflow_prepped_recipe(lm_wf) %&gt;% bake(ames_holdout),\n  type = \"pred_int\",\n  level = 0.90\n) %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(contains(\".pred\"), ~10^.x))\nCombos\n\nLog + scale by mean\n\nExample From Statistical Rethinking Ch8 pg 246\n\n“Raw magnitudes of GDP aren’t meaningful to humans. Since wealth generates wealth, it tends to be exponentially related to anything that increases it (earlier in chapter). This is like saying that the absolute distances in wealth grow increasingly large, as nations become wealthier. So when we work with logarithms instead, we can work on a more evenly spaced scale of magnitudes”\n“Log GDP is divided by the average value. So it is rescaled as a proportion of the international average. 1 means average, 0.8 means 80% of the average, and 1.1 means 10% more than average.”"

Linear regression does not model non-monotonic relationships between the input features and the target while tree models do.\n\nFor example, the raw numerical encoding (0-24) of the “hour” feature prevents the linear model from recognizing that an increase of hour in the morning from 6 to 8 should have a strong positive impact on the number of bike rentals while a increase of similar magnitude in the evening from 18 to 20 should have a strong negative impact on the predicted number of bike rentals.\nOptions\n\nOne-hot encoding for small cardinality (e.g. hours) and binning for large cardinality features (e.g. minutes)\nSpline tranformation\n\nReduces number of features with comparable performance to one-hot\nPeriod isn’t used, just here (examples) for reference to the number of splines chosen\nnum_knots = num_splines + 1\nDegree 3 was used in the sklearn tutorial\n\nSKLearn also has an extrapolation=“periodic” arg\n\n“Periodic splines with a periodicity equal to the distance between the first and last knot are used.

In this case it is recommended to manually set the knot values to control the period.”\nDon’t see this arg in step_bs or step_ns\n\n\nExamples\n\nHour feature (period = 24, num_splines = 12)\nWeekday (day of the week, numeric) feature (period=7, num_splines=3)\nMonth (period=12, num_splines=6)\n\n\nSpline transform + step_kpca_poly or step_kpca_rbf\n\nProduced best results in sklearn tutorial\nKernel function smooths out the spline\nAdd kpca_poly allows a regression model to capture non-linear (spline) interactions (kpca_poly)\n\nBoosted trees naturally capture these features\n\nExample in sklearn tutorial used n_components=300 in elasticnet regression which seems crazy, but their point was that if you were to create non-linear interaction features manually it’d be in the thousands\nUsing one-hot features instead of splines would require 3 or 4 times the number of components to reach the same performance which substantially increases training time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering\n\nSee Clustering, Time Series for details\n\n\n\nLags\n\nIf there is a gap period between the training and the validation (or test) set, all lags should be larger than this period\n\nSometimes predictions will have to be made with data that isn’t up-to-date.

Near ages of zero the effective slope is near −0.15, indicating each additional year of Age reduces the value of the link function by about 0.15. At the oldest ages the effective slopes are settling down to a value near −0.09, indicating each additional year of age in this age group decreases the link function by −0.09."

The vectors creating this basis are the eigenvectors of the variance-covariance matrix. Reducing the dimension is then easily done by selecting the eigenvectors that are most representative of the initial data: those that contain most of the covariance. The amount of covariance stored by the vectors is quantified by the eigenvalues: the larger the eigenvalue, the more interesting its associated vectors.\nProjects variables orthogonally which removes correlation between predictor variables. The projection is in the direction of maximum variation such that the variation is distributed unequally among the transformed vectors. This allows the user to reduce the feature space while still being able to capture most of variance in the data.\nThe principal components are equal to linear combinations of the correlated variables and these components are orthogonal to each other.\nWhy? When multiple variables are highly correlated to each other it causes the math used calculate regression models to break down. High dimension datasets also require large amount computational resources. Too many columns compared to the number of rows.\n\n\n\nMisc\n\nAs a multicollinearity detector?\n\n“use principal component analysis, and examine the screeplot, or proportion of variation explained by a subset of principal components. If all (or almost all) of the variation is explained with a small subset of all the variables, it means you have a multicollinearity problem. You will need to drop some variables or do some other dimension reduction to fix it before choosing your final model.”\nI mean what if you have 20 variables and 3 are collinear, would this be detectable with PCA?

It might arbitrarily change the sign of the component and change the meaning of the feature.\n\nPCA doesn’t take the response variable into account (unsupervised). Therefore, the directions (eigenvectors) obtained may be well-suited for the predictor variables, but not necessarily optimal for predicting the response. It does often produce pretty good results though.\n\nAn alternative would be Partial Least Squares (PLS) which does take the response into account (supervised).\n\nIn practice, PLS reduces bias while potentially increasing the variance so the benefit vs PCA regression is usually a wash.\nCapable of handling multivariate regression\nPopular in chemometrics for analyzing spectra.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlots\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from: https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/modeling-statistics/multivariate/how-to/principal-components/interpret-the-results/all-statistics-and-graphs/\n(See bkmk) use broom::augment to add original data to pca output.

Most of the red dots are captured in the orthogonal and bad sections but quite a few normal observation (blue) points too. So this method needs to be used as a guide and followed up upon when it flags points.\n\n\n\nHotelling’s T2 and SPE/DmodX (Complementary Tests)\n\n{{pca}}\nHotelling’s T2 works by computing the chi-square tests across the top n_components for which the p-values are returned that describe the likeliness of an outlier.

    "text": "Transformers\n\nMisc\n\nI think most of the research is in using these as forecast models themselves and not necessarily as a categorical/discrete feature transformation\nNotes from\n\nTransformers in Time Series: A Survey\n\nAttention heads -  enable the Transformer to learn relationships between a time step and every other time step in the input sequence\n\nArchitecture Comparisons\n\nRNNs implement sequential processing: The input (let’s say sentences) is processed word by word.\nTransformers use non-sequential processing: Sentences are processed as a whole, rather than word by word\nThe LSTM requires 8 time-steps to process the sentences, while BERT requires only 2\n\nBERT is better able to take advantage of parallelism, provided by modern GPU acceleration\n\nRNNs are forced to compress their learned representation of the input sequence into a single state vector before moving to future tokens.\nLSTMs solved the vanishing gradient issue that vanilla RNNs suffer from, but they are still prone to exploding gradients. Thus, they are struggling with longer dependencies\nTransformers, on the other hand, have much higher bandwidth. For example, in the Encoder-Decoder Transformer model, the Decoder can directly attend to every token in the input sequence, including the already decoded.\nTransformers use a special case called Self-Attention: This mechanism allows each word in the input to reference every other word in the input.\nTransformers can use large Attention windows (e.g. 512, 1048). Hence, they are very effective at capturing contextual information in sequential data over long ranges.\n\nIssues\n\nThe initial BERT model has a limit of 512 tokens. The naive approach to addressing this issue is to truncate the input sentences.\n\nAlternatively, we can create Transformer Models that surpass that limit, making it up to 4096 tokens. However, the cost of self-attention is quadratic with respect to the sentence length.\n\n\nRobustness and Model Size\n\n\nRobustness: As the time series gets longer (aka Input Len), Autoformer holds it’s performance best\n\nThe rest start to crumble after the length gets past 192 time points\n\nModel Size: Autoformer is again the best and holds its performance pretty much up through 24 layers\nHyper-parameters:\n\nembedding dimension\nnumber of heads\nnumber of layers\n\nIn general, 3-6 layers yields the best performance\nMore layers typically adds more accuracy. In NLP and Computer Vision (CV), their models are usually 12 to 128 layers, so this will be an area of improvement.\n\n\nAutoformer Wu et al., 2021 has a moving average trend decomposition component that can be added to other transformer architectures to greatly enhance performance\n\n\nPatchTST (paper, article)\n\nMisc\n\nPackages\n\n{{neuralforecast}} - NIXLA collection of neural forecasting models\n\n\nPatched Attention: Their attention takes in large parts of the time series as tokens instead of a point-wise attention\n\nPrevious Architectures\n\nSelf-Attention treats each timestamp treated as a token\n\nIssues\n\nPermutation-Invariance — where the same attention values would be observed if you flipped the points around (?)\nEach timestamp doesn’t have a lot of information in it and gets its importance from the timestamps around it. So treating each timestamp as a token is like tokenizing a character instead of a word.\n\nResults\n\nOverfitting: adding noise didn’t significantly decrease transformer performance\nLonger lookback periods didn’t increase accuracy. Meaning significant temporal patterns weren’t recognized\n\n\n\nPatchTST\n\nSplit each input time series up into fixed-length “patches” (i.e. windows).\nThese patches are then passed through dedicated channels as the input tokens to the main model (the length of the patch is the token size).\nThe model then adds a positional encoding to each patch and runs it through a vanilla transformer encoder.\nBenefits\n\nTakes advantage of local semantic information (i.e. window of timestamps)\nFewer input tokens needed allowing the model to capture info from longer sequences and dramatically reducing the memory required to train and predict\nMakes it viable to do Representational Learning (?)\n\n\n\nChannel Independence: different target series in a time series are processed independently of each other with different attention weights.\n\nPrevious Architectures\n\nAll target time series would be concatenated together into a matrix where each row of the matrix is a single series and the columns are the input tokens (one for each timestamp).\nThese input tokens would then be projected into the embedding space, and these embeddings were passed into a single attention layer\n\nPatchTST\n\nEach target series is passed independently into the transformer backbone\nTherefore, every series has its own set of attention weights, allowing the model to specialize better.\n\nSeems like the opposite rationalization of global model forecasting (See Forecasting, Hierarchical/Grouped &gt;&gt; Global\n\n\n\nBenchmarks\n\n\nTwo variants: 64 “patches” and 42 “patches”\n\n42 patch variant has the same lookback window as the other models\nBoth variants have a patch length of 16 and a stride of 8 were used to construct the input tokens\n\nOn average, PatchTST/64 achieved a 21% reduction in MSE and a 16.7% reduction in MAE. PatchTST/42 achieved a 20.2% reduction in MSE and a 16.4% reduction in MAE."

    "text": "Global Modeling\n\nMisc\n\nfrom Why aren’t you getting the most out of your Marketing AI\n\n“Consider the consumer goods company whose data scientists proudly announced that they’d increased the accuracy of a new sales-volume forecasting system, reducing the error rate from 25% to 17%. Unfortunately, in improving the system’s overall accuracy, they increased its precision with low-margin products while reducing its accuracy with high-margin products. Because the cost of underestimating demand for the high-margin offerings substantially outweighed the value of correctly forecasting demand for the low-margin ones, profits fell when the company implemented the new,”more accurate” system.”\nThis should be something to be aware of and monitored with global forecasting model. Does the optimization of single function unintentionally optimize the error of a series with less financial importance over a more financially important series in order to minimize global error? Where in classification models, error metrics and loss functions are chosen by the cost/benefit of TP, FP, TN, FN.  Can a loss function be developed that tunes a global model and weights errors by group series?\n\n\nFrom paper, Principles and Algorithms for Forecasting Groups of Time Series:Locality and Globality More detailed (raw) notes, Principles and Algorithms for Forecasting Groups of Time Series: Locality and Globality\n\nPaper tested global vs local methods on groups of series across many datasets (thousands of series).\n\nglobal models almost always had better generalization error. (ge = training set score - test set score)\n\nWhile local models may have better in-sample performance, the low generalization error of global models makes its CV score a truer representation of out-of-sample than with local methods. This should result in better production models since our algorithm selection will be better.\n\nglobal models almost always outperformed local methods on most homogeneous and heterogenous groups of series\n\nFinds that for global methods, the more complex the model (e.g. OLS –&gt; ML –&gt; DL), the better the forecasting\n\nUsing a global method –&gt; larger dataset –&gt; more degrees of freedom –&gt; suitable conditions for more complex models to perform well\n\nDancho, global example using modeltime, makes point that global models perform better on group dataset as a whole but not necessarily for every individual series in the dataset.\n\nmodeltime_accuracy(acc_by_id = T) will measure the accuracy per time series.\nOptions\n\nMight be better to remove worse performing series and just forecast them using a local method\nMore likely it’s better to keep those series in the global method since they probably adds predictive value to the other series in the dataset and additionaly forecast those worse performing series with local method\n\n\nIf we want to estimate a complex pattern in a series and that series has sufficient sample size, then we are better off with local models.\nTerms\n\nlocal method - fitting each series separately with a different model\nglobal method - one model for the entire set of series\n\nAssumptions\n\nGroups of independent time series\n\nEach series in the group should evolve by similar patterns but independently of each other\n\nThinking this assumption can be somewhat relaxed and still achieve superior results vs local models. (see pedestrian data example below)\nPaper lists many popular datasets that can be tested for independence to see how strict this assumption needs to be.\n\nUnder heavy dependence global models loose their beneficial performance guarantees (though practicioners could still try them)\n\n\nExample\n\nEach time series in the group represents the hourly pedestrian count of a different location across Melbourne’s CBD (city bar district: entertainment area)\n\nEach location in this district is different series.\nThe domain that allows for the “same pattern of evolution” would be that each series is measuring pedestrian activity.\nSince they’re at different locations, the counts are independent of each other.\n\n(I guess… if this is a large area and the same pedestrians are being counted. Maybe one group is goint to a concert, another is going to a show, and another is bar hopping, etc.)\n\n\n\nGlobal Method Steps:\n\nFix an AR order (i.e. number of lags)\nCreate lags according to that AR order for each series\nFor each series, embed the observed series and each lag into a matrix\nStack these matrices on top of each other to create one large matrix\nRun CV, using the large matrix, to determine the best lag order\nForecast using the large matrix.\n\nLags\n\nGlobal models should have large memories (i.e. large number of lags)\n\nLag order (i.e. max lag) should usually be determined by the length of the shortest time series in the dataset.\n\nOptimal lag may be in the 100s\n\nNotable exception to the pattern of “longer memory, better accuracy” is intermittent data where smaller lag orders work better for global models.\n\nMake sure the lag order is NOT a multiple of seasonal/cyclical frequency of each series\n\nPreferrably the lag order should be greater than the largest seasonal/cyclical frequency of the group as there is usually an improvement in error.\n\nThis effect is explained as an over-fitting phenomena related to the heterogeneity of seasonal strengths in the datasets. In those datasets that contain both strongly seasonal and non seasonal series (or different seasonal periods), a global model tends to favor the seasonality at memory levels that are multiples of the frequency because it produces good results in-sample. When the memory is over the seasonal period, the global model can use its coefficients to fit both seasonal and non seasonal patterns\n\n\nPolynomial Autoregression (AR) models exponentiate the lags. So the design matrix includes the lags and the exponentiated series.\n\nIf the polynomial is order 3, then order 2 is also included. So, now, the design matrix would be the lags, the square of each lag, and the cube of each lag\n\n\nPreprocessing\n\nProbably should standardize or at least scale\n\nFor ML/DL models, standardization of the series had a positive, minor effect (lm models are scale invariant)\nIf any of the series has a meaningful maximum or minimums at 1 or 0 respectively, then you maybe just want to scale.\nAlso possible to add a scale variable to the matrix so that even if you standardize or scale, that info is still available to the model.\nWithout standardization and depending on the error measure that you use, prediction errors on series that are on larger scales may have an outsized effect on the overall error calculation\nScaling can help deal with outlier series (e.g. one series has much larger scale than the rest, dominating the fitting) and in the case of deep networks, it makes them faster to train\n\nScaling by MASE and using MASE as the loss function is equivalent to to minimizing the MAE in the preprocessed time series.\n\n“scaling done by the MASE can be applied to data as a preprocessing normalizing step, which we apply to each series. Then minimizing the MASE is equivalent to minimizing the mean absolute error in the preprocessed time series. Compared to SMAPE, MASE is easier to fit with off-the-shelf optimizers (it is convex), and it therefore isolates better the effect of the model class rather than the optimization procedure used to fit it”\n\n\n\nIndex variable not needed.\n\ntidymodels has a recipe step to where you can include an index variable but give it role = id. It won’t be used as a predictor but could help with separating out predictons later on.\n\n\nSeasonality\n\nDon’t remove the seasonality from the data\nAutomatically discovered, even by a global AR model, and even though it’s not part of the model specification.\nFor DL/ML models\n\nadding seasonality features may help but is not required for seasonal time series\nadding tsfeatures (ML/DL) and using larger input window sizes (DL) or sufficiently large AR orders (ML) should be enough to account for seasonality\n\n\nPartitioning heterogeneous time series\n\nheterogeneous: different domains (measured in different units) and with different frequencies (from hourly to yearly measurements), patterns, trends, etc.\nFor heterogeneous series, potentially more accuracy with partitioning the series by frequency and/or domains before fitting sub(?)-global models\n\nPartioning (or clustering) reduces sample size though. So something to keep an eye on.\n\nWithout partitioning, DL global models with tsfeatures + lags + frequency variables (fourier or splines?) outperformed partitioned models in the paper\n\nDeep Network Autoregressive (Keras):\n\nReLu MLP with 5 layers, each of 32 units width\nLinear activation in the final layer\nAdam optimizer with default learning rate.\nEarly stopping on a cross-validation set at 15% of the dataset\nBatch size is set to 1024 for speed\nLoss function is the mean absolute error (MAE).\n\n\nPartitioning and clustering\n\nBoth can potentially be beneficial\nUsing clustering adds a potentially expensive processing step, plus a sufficiently complex model (e.g. the DL model w/additional features above) should detect whatever additional information that clustering is likely to provide.\n\n\nPolynomial Regression\n\nBad to use for a local model but pretty good as a global model\n\nLocal Model: Recursive forecasting makes polynomials numerically unstable (e.g. an 18-step-ahead forecast for this dataset is equivalent to a 54 degree polynomial) and are not recommended in the literature for automatic time series forecasting.\nGlobal Model: 2nd order polynomial fit would’ve placed 2nd in M4 (yearly ts) and the DL global model would’ve placed 3rd for the Quarterly data.\n\nAccomplished by squaring the lags of the series and adding them as extra variables to the large matrix.\n\n\nPolynomial Autoregression (AR) models exponentiate the lags. So the design matrix includes the lags and the exponentiated series.\n\nIf the polynomial is order 3, then order 2 is also included. So, now, the design matrix would be the lags, the square of each lag, and the cube of each lag\nlibrary(dplyr); library(timetk)\n# tbl w/polynomial design matrix of order 3 (along with original series, group variable, and date variable)\n# value is the ts values (original series)\npoly_tbl &lt;- group_tbl %&gt;% \n  tk_augment_lags(.value = value, .lags = 1:4) %&gt;%   \n  mutate(across(contains(\"lag\"), .fns = list(~.x^2, ~.x^3), .names = \"{.col}_{ifelse(.fn==1, 'quad','cube')\"))\n\n.fn  is the item number in the .fns list.\nsquared lag 2 will have the name “value_lag2_quad”\n\n\n\nMultivariate Time Series (see section in Forecasting, Multivariate)\n\nInterdependent series (think VAR models)\nExample: Energy consumption per household and income per household time series (i.e. energy consumption and income are interdependent) represent a multivariate process\n\nDataset has households sampled all around the planet. The pair of time series for each household does not necessary affect any of the other households, but we could assume that they follow the same pattern.\n\n“Sampled from around the planet” allows us to reasonably assume these pairs of time series are independent."

Then, the model’s one-step ahead forecast is used as data to get the 2nd-step ahead forecast.\n\nThe one-step ahead forecast is NOT added to the training data and the model refitted. It replaces the 0th lag value in the training data, and the previous 0th lag data becomes the 1st lag data, etc. The final lag (e.g t-3 in the example data) that was used in training the model is discarded. Therefore, the same number of lags that was used in training the model remains the same.

    "text": "Dynamic Factor Models (DFM)\n\nCommon dynamics of a large number of time series variables stem from a relatively small number of unobserved (or latent) factors, which in turn evolve over time.\nFor some macroeconomic applications it might be interesting to see whether a set of obserable variables depends on common drivers (unobserved factors). The estimation of such common factors can be done using so-called factor analytical models.\n\nFactor Analysis but for time series\nFor large sets of time series, which show, in most cases, strong correlation patterns\n\ntl;dr:\n\nRun PCA on bunch of time series that are relevant to the outcome variable you want to model or forecast.\nDetermine the number of factors (components) from the PCA\nUse VAR to determine the number of lags (or potentially leads) for the factors\nFit a model for the outcome variable using the factors and their lags as predictors.\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from\n\nHandbook of Macroeconomics, Ch.8\n\n111 pgs; SVARs, FAVARs, DFMs\n\n\npackages\n\n{dfms}:\n\nImports {collapse} and {Rcpp} so it should be very fast\n3 methods available\n\nA two-step estimator based on Kalman filtering\n\nfast, and forcasts should be similar to the other 2\n\nA quasi-maximum likelihood approach\nMaximum likelihood estimation of factor models on datasets with arbitrary pattern of missing data\n\n\n{nowcasting}- fit dynamic factor models specific to mixed-frequency nowcasting applications.\n\nThe latter two packages additionally support blocking of variables into different groups for which factors are to be estimated, and EM adjustments for variables at different frequencies\n\n{bvartools}\n\nUse Cases\n\nSensor Data\n\ne.g. IoT devices, telecommunication, industrial manufacturing, electric grid\n\nFinance\nMacroeconomics\n\nExample: (ebook ch8. introduction): a single-factor DFM fit using 58 quarterly US real activity variables (sectoral industrial production (IP), sectoral employment, sales, and National Income and Product Account (NIPA) series) is used to backcast four-quarter growth rates of four measures of aggregate economic activity (real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), total nonfarm, employment, IP, and manufacturing and trade sales)\n\n\nBlack solid line is the the observed; Red dotted line is the fitted value\nFitted line from lm(outcome ~ factor)\n\noutcome is total nonfarm, employment, IP, or manufacturing and trade sales\nfactor is from the dfm\n\nR2s of the fits range from 0.73 for GDP to 0.92 for employment.\n\nChicago Fed fits a factor model called the “cfnai” on these key economic indicators (Thread)\n\n\n\n“Structural DFMs, FAVARs, and SVARs are a unified suite of tools with fundamentally similar structures that differ in whether the factors are treated as observed or unobserved. By using a large number of variables and treating the factors as unobserved, DFMs”average out” the measurement error in individual time series, and thereby improve the ability to span the common macroeconomic structural shocks.”\n\nFactor Analytical Model General Form (Static)\n\nxt = λ*ft + ut where ut ∼ N(0,R)\n\nxt is an M-dimensional vector of observable variables\nft is an N×1 vector of unobserved factors\nλ is an M×N matrix of factor loadings\nut is an error term\nR is a M×M measurement (observation) covariance matrix and assumed to be diagonal\n\nAlso known as the measurement equation, which describes the relationship between the observed variables and the factors\n\nAllowing ft to take autocorrelation into account makes it “dynamic”\n\nft = A1*ft−1 + … + Ap*ft−p + vt where vt∼ N(0,Q)\n\nAi is the N×N coefficient matrix correponding to the ith lag of factor, f\nvt is an error term\nQ is the N×N state covariance matrix\n\nAlso known as the transition equation, which describes the intertemporal relationships between the factors\n\nPreprocessing\n\nAll series must be stationary with no cointegration\nAll series must be scaled and centered\nThe number of factors must be chosen.\nThen, the number of lags can chosen given the number of factors\nData at different frequencies\n\n{dfms} has a couple methods that approximate values\nDuplicate the longer frequency series multiple times. (see article)\n\ne.g. duplicate a quarterly series 3 times in a dataset with monthly time series.\nWhen these series get converted to shorter frequencies before fitting (e.g. quarterly to monthly), the missing values will just be NAs which will cause these series to have less weight in the estimation process. By duplicating them, it gives there values more weight.\nIf you decide to give these series more weight, you should be relatively certain they’re important to the forecast.\n\nEstimate different factor models for monthly and quarterly series, and combine them for the final prediction (e.g. by aggregating or blocking the monthly factor estimates (?)).\n{nowcasting} and {nowcastDFM} provide elaborate models for mixed-frequency nowcasting (but will be slower)\n\n\nForecasts\n\nFactors are dynamically forecasted using the transition equation.\nThe factor forecasts can then be fed to the observation equation to obtain forecasts for the input series\nExample: Introduction to dfms\n\n\n4 factors have been chosen and they’re highlighted\nInput series are in gray\nForecasts (after dotted vertical) converge the mean.\nquarterly variables, such as US GDP, to be forecast using a large set of monthly variables released with different lags\nreduce the information contained in dozens of monthly time series into only two dynamic factors. These two estimated factors, which are initially monthly, are then transformed into quarterly factors and used in a regression against GDP\n\nBackcasting refers to forecasting the value of a yet unpublished variable for a past period, while nowcasting will be with respect to the current period\nThe chosen number of factors, r∗ will correspond the IC with the lowest value. The penalty in equation IC2 is highest when considering finite sample\nGiven a strategy to identify one or more structural shocks, a structural DFM can be used to estimate responses to these structural shocks.\ndescription of the error terms to the equations\n\nmean-zero idiosyncratic component et (measurement eq)\n\nidiosyncratic disturbance can be serially correlated. if so, then model is incompletely specified. Solution is to model it as an autoregression\nIf there is no autocorrelation in the error terms (*unreasonable assumption across most applications), then the model is an exact DFM, and the correlation of one series with another occurs only through the\nlatent factors\n\nηt is the q x 1 vector of (serially uncorrelated) mean-zero innovations to the factors (transition eq)\n\nIf some of the variables are cointegrated, then transforming them to first differences loses potentially important information that would be present in the error correctionterms (that is, the residual from a cointegrating equation, possibly with cointegrating coefficients imposed). Here we discuss two different treatments of cointegrated variables, both of which are used in the empirical application of Sections 6 and 7.\n\nOption 1: Include the first difference of some of the variables and error correction terms for the others. This is appropriate if the error correction term potentially contains important information that would be useful in estimating one or more factors.\nOption 2: include all the variables in first differences and not to include any spreads. Appropriate if the first differences of the factors are informative for the common trend but the cointegrating residuals do not load on common factors\n\nDidn’t understand it lol (pg 427). Think there’s an example in sect 7.2 that will illustrate it.\nExample: While there is empirical evidence that these oil prices, for example Brent and WTI, are cointegrated, there is no a priori reason to believe that the WTI-Brent spread is informative about broad macro factors, and rather that spread reflects details of oil markets, transient transportation and storage disruptions, and so forth.\n\nOption 3: specify the DFM in levels or log levels of some or all of the variables, then to estimate cointegrating relations and common stochastic trends as part of estimating the DFM. This approach goes beyond the coverage of this chapter, which assumes that variables have been transformed to be I(0) and trendless.\n\nBanerjee and Marcellino (2009)and Banerjee et al. (2014, 2016) develop a factor-augmented error correction model (FECM) in which the levels of a subset of the variables are expressed as cointegrated with the common factors. The discussion in this chapter about applications and identification extends to the FECM.\n\n\nThe error in estimation of the factors during PCA can be ignored when they are used as regressors"

I read this in an article about VAR models “process is stationary if all the roots z1, . . . , zn of the determinant det(ψ(z)), or det(I − Bz) = 0, lie outside of the unit circle.”\n\nOne advantage of differencing over detrending to remove trend is that no parameters are estimated in the differencing operation.\nOne disadvantage, however, is that differencing does not yield an estimate of the stationary process\nIf the goal is to coerce the data to stationarity, then differencing may be more appropriate.\nDifferencing is also a viable tool if the trend is fixed\n\nrandom walking looking series should be differenced and not detrended.\n\nBackshift operator notation:\n\nin general:  ∇d = (1 − B)d\n\nwhere d is the order of differencing\nFractional differencing is when 0 &lt; d &lt; 1\n\nwhen 0 &lt; d &lt; 0.5, the series is classified as a long term memory series (often used for environmental time series arising in hydrology)\n\nIf d is negative, then its called forward-shift differencing\n\nExamples\n\nB yt  =  yt-1;  B2 yt  =  yt-2\nSeasonal Difference: (1 - B)(1 - Bm) yt = (1 - B - Bm + Bm + 1)yt = yt - yt-1 - yt-m + yt-m-1\nARIMA : AR(p)(I) = MA(q)\n\n\n\nARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1)4 for quarterly data (m = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetrending (for trend-stationary processes)(deterministic trend)\n\nIt is possible for a time series to be non-stationary, yet have no unit root and be trend-stationary\n\na trend-stationary process is a stochastic process from which an underlying trend (function solely of time) can be removed (detrended), leaving a stationary process.\n\nIf an estimate of the stationary process is essential, then detrending may be more appropriate.\nHow is this back-transformed after forecasting?\n\nmaybe look at “forecasting with STL” section in fpp2\n\n\nIn both unit root and trend-stationary processes, the mean can be growing or decreasing over time; however, in the presence of a shock, trend-stationary processes are mean-reverting (i.e. transitory, the time series will converge again towards the growing mean, which was not affected by the shock) while unit-root processes have a permanent impact on the mean (i.e. no convergence over time).\nTesting\n\nKPSS test: H0 = trend-stationary, Ha =  unit root.\n\nurca::ur_kpss the H0 is stationarity\ntseries::kpss.test(res, null = “Trend”) where H0 is “trend-stationarity”\n\nDickey-Fuller tests: H0 = unit root, Ha = stationary or trend-stationary depending on version\nKPSS-type tests are intended to complement unit root tests, such as the Dickey–Fuller tests. By testing both the unit root hypothesis and the stationarity hypothesis, one can distinguish series that appear to be stationary, series that appear to have a unit root, and series for which the data (or the tests) are not sufficiently informative to be sure whether they are stationary.\n\nSteps:\n\nADF:\n\nIf H0 rejected.

See lm doc for further details on best practices.\nARIMA models make h-step out predictions by iterating 1-step forward predictions and feeding the intermediate predictions in as if they were actual observations (0 are used for the errors)\nPolynomial Autoregression (AR) models exponentiate the lags. So the design matrix includes the lags and the exponentiated series.\n\nIf the polynomial is order 3, then order 2 is also included.

This illustrates the general result that the simple OLS estimator is consistent but the associated standard error is generally not trustworthy”\n\nHyndman\n\n“The forecasts from a regression model with autocorrelated errors are still unbiased, and so are not “wrong,” but they will usually have larger prediction intervals than they need to. Therefore we should always look at an ACF plot of the residuals.”\nThe estimated coefficients  are no longer the best estimates, as some information has been ignored in the calculation;\n\nmeaning modeling the errors to take into account the autocorrelation\n\nAny statistical tests associated with the model (e.g., t-tests on the coefficients) will be incorrect.\n\naffected by the bloated std errors\n\nThe AICc values of the fitted models are no longer a good guide as to which is the best model for forecasting.\nIn most cases, the p-values associated with the coefficients will be too small, and so some predictor variables will appear to be important when they are not. This is known as “spurious regression.”\n\n\ntrend (β1 t) is modeled by setting the variable  t to just an index variable (i.e. t = 1, …., T). Modeling quadratic trend would be adding in t2 to the model formula.\n\nHyndman suggests that using splines is a better approach than using t2\nFrom Steinmitz’s CFR article\n\nInstead of trend() (like in forecast::), he’s using poly(date, 2) to include a quadratic trend\n\n\nR2 and adj R2\n\nAppropriate for time series (i.e. estimate of the population R2), as long as the data are stationary and weakly dependent\n\ni.e. the variances of both the errors and the dependent variable do not change over time.\ni.e. if yt has a unit root (integrated of order 1, I(1)) (need differenced)\n\n\nInterpretation of coefficients\n\n\n\nIf  x  increases by one unit today, the change in  y  will be  β0+β1+…+βs  after  s  periods; this quantity is called the  s -period interim multiplier.

This is an improvement, but data for all those layers piles up, and your toolchain wants to embed this in your page as reams of base64 encoded text. Page file sizes are completely blowing out.\n            \n* Use Cases\n    * Simplification of geometry is not desirable, e.g. because of alignment issues\n        * e.g. The zoomed-in road network has to align with the road network on the basemap, so that viewers can see features that lie along sections of road.\n    * Simplification of geometry doesn’t really help, you still have too many features\n    * Cumulatively your datasets are too large to handle.\n* **Vector Tiles**  - contain arrays of annotated spatial coordinate data which is combined with a separately transmitted stylesheet to produce the tile image.\n    * i.e. The edges of the roads, the boundaries of buildings etc. Not an image, but the building blocks for one\n    * Different stylesheets can use the same vector data to produce radically different looking maps that either highlight or omit data with certain attributes\n    * Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) - [specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/data/tilesets/guides/vector-tiles-standards/); the de-facto standard for vector tile files\n        * stored as a Google protocol buffer - a tightly packed binary format.\n* **MBTiles** - by Mapbox; describe a method of storing an entire MVT tileset inside a single file.\n    * Internally .mbtiles files are SQLlite databases containing two tables: _metadata_ and _tiles_.\n        * tiles table\n            * indexed by z,x,y\n            * contains a tile\\_data column for the vector tile protocol buffers, which are compressed using gzip\n    * SQLite format and gzip compression help with efficient retrieval and transmission\n* Using vector tiles we can have unlimited reference layers. Each one contributes nothing to the report file size since it is only streamed on demand when required.\n* Workflow to convert data to .tbtiles\n    * In R, read source data as an sf, and wrangle\n        * Tippecanoe expects by epsg 4326 by default\n    * Write data out to geojson\n    * On the command line, convert geojson to .mbtiles using the tippecanoe command line utility.\n        * Tippecanoe sources\n            * Mapbox version - [repo](https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe)\n                * McBain says, he uses this version and hasn't had any problems\n                * README has helpful cookbook section\n            * Actively maintained community forked version - [repo](https://github.com/protomaps/tippecanoe)\n            * May be a headache to get dependencies if using Windows\n        * Alternatively it can output a folder structure full of protocol buffer files.\n    * Example\ntippecanoe -zg \\\n          -o abs_mesh_blocks.mbtiles \\\n          --coalesce-densest-as-needed \\\n          --extend-zooms-if-still-dropping \\\n          mb_shapes.geojson\n\nMapping\n\nExample\n\n\nlibrary(mvtview)\nlibrary(rdeck)\n\n# Fire up the server\nserve_mvt(\"abs_mesh_blocks.mbtiles\", port = 8765)\n# Serving your tile data from http://0.0.0.0:8765/abs_mesh_blocks.json.\n# Run clean_mvt() to remove all server sessions.\n\nmesh_blocks &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(\"http://0.0.0.0:8765/abs_mesh_blocks.json\")\n\n# Map the data\nrdeck(\n    initial_bounds = structure(meshblocks$bounds, crs = 4326, class = \"bbox\") # set map limits using the tilejson\n) |&gt;\n  add_mvt_layer(\n    data = rdeck::tile_json(\"http://0.0.0.0:8765/abs_mesh_blocks.json\"),\n    get_fill_color = scale_color_linear(\n      random_attribute\n    ),\n    opacity = 0.6\n  )\n\nSee McBain article for options on hosting .mbtiles files\nRegarding “abs_mesh_blocks”: {mvtview} provides a way to fetch the metadata table from .mbtiles as json by querying a json file with the same name as the .mbitles file.\nThe structure of ‘tilejson’ is yet another specification created by Mapbox, and is supported in deck.gl (and therefore {rdeck}) to describe tile endpoints."

The value is the party that wins the parliamentary seat\n\nThe bar graph shows the values the map is trying to visualize geographically. The hexabins better represent the close race by removing the distorting element which is the geographical size of the provinces.\nEach voting district (hexabin) is voting for 1 representative and has the same number of voters, but districts can have vastly different areas depending on population density.\n\nKeep unit at constant size (like hexabins) but alter hex shape to keep state shape.\n\nA better U.S. house election results map?\nResults\n\nstate size depends on number of districts which depends on population and therefore correctly conveys voting results visually across the whole country\nDistricts get distorted but the states retain their shape and so distortion of the overall visualization is minimized\n\n\n\n\nUber’s H3 grid system -\n\nMisc\n\npackages: h3r, h3-r\ndocs\nAdd census data to H3 hexagons, calculate overlaps (article)\nFor large areas, you can reduce the number of hexagons by merging some hexagons into larger hexagons.\n\nReduces storage size\nIssue: leaves small gaps between hexagons\n\nmight not matter for your use case\n\nSolution: use Microsoft’s Quadkeys approach (see article)\n\n\nEach hexagon has a series of smaller hexagons that sit (mostly) inside of another, which creates a hierarchy that can be used for consistent referencing and analysis, all the way down to lengths of 2 feet for the edges.\n“Hexagons were an important choice because people in a city are often in motion, and hexagons minimize the quantization error introduced when users move through a city. Hexagons also allow us to approximate radiuses easily.”\nRe other shapes: “We could use postal code areas, but such areas have unusual shapes and sizes which are not helpful for analysis, and are subject to change for reasons entirely unrelated to what we would use them for. Zones could also be drawn by Uber operations teams based on their knowledge of the city, but such zones require frequent updating as cities change and often define the edges of areas arbitrarily”\nGrid systems can have comparable shapes and sizes across the cities that Uber operates in and are not subject to arbitrary changes. While grid systems do not align to streets and neighborhoods in cities, they can be used to efficiently represent neighborhoods by clustering grid cells. Clustering can be done using objective functions, producing shapes much more useful for analysis. Determining membership of a cluster is as efficient as a set lookup operation.\n16 Resolutions\n\n0 - 15 (0 being coarsest and 15 being finest)\nEach finer resolution has cells with one seventh the area of the coarser resolution. Hexagons cannot be perfectly subdivided into seven hexagons, so the finer cells are only approximately contained within a parent cell.\nThe identifiers for these child cells can be easily truncated to find their ancestor cell at a coarser resolution, enabling efficient indexing. Because the children cells are only approximately contained, the truncation process produces a fixed amount of shape distortion. This distortion is only present when performing truncation of a cell identifier; when indexing locations at a specific resolution, the cell boundaries are exact.\nWant a resolution granular enough to introduce variability and wide enough to capture the effects of an area\nExample of resolution 6 in Iowa"

This is especially important when working with large organizations and open source projects, where multiple developers are constantly committing changes to the same repository. A faster repository means less time waiting for Git commands such as git clone or git push to finish. It helps to optimize the storage space, as large files are replaced by pointers which take up less space. This can help avoid storage issues, especially when working with remote servers.\n\nMisc\n\nSee How to Improve Performance in Git: The Complete Guide\n\nExplainer, config settings, advanced gc, checkout, and clone commands\n\nUse .gitignore\n\nGenerated files, like cache or build files\n\nThey will be modified at each different generation — and there’s no need to keep track of those changes.\n\nThird-party libraries\n\nInstead, aim for a list of the required dependencies (and the correct version) so that everyone can download and install them whenever the repo is cloned.\n\nFor example, with a package.json file for JavaScript projects you can (and should) exclude the /node_modules folder.\n.DS_Store files (which are automatically created by macOS) are another good candidate\n\n\n\nGit LFS\n\nDesigned specifically to handle large file versioning. LFS saves your local repositories from becoming unnecessarily big, preventing you from downloading unnessary data.\n\nGit LFS intercepts any large files and sends them to a separate server, leaving a smaller pointer file in the repository that links to the actual asset on the Git LFS server.\n\nThis is an extension to the standard Git feature set, so you will need to make sure that your code hosting provider supports it (all the popular ones do).\nAlso need to download and install the CLI extension on your machine before installing it in your repository.\nSet-Up\n$ git lfs install\n$ git lfs track \"*.wav\"\n$ git lfs track \"images/*.psd\"\n$ git lfs track \"videos\"\n$ git add .gitattributes\n\nTells Git LFS which file extensions it should manage.\n.gitattributes notes the file names and patterns in this text file and, just like any other change, it should be staged and committed to the repository.\nCan now add files and commit as normal\nList all file extensions being tracked: git lfs track\nList all files being managed: git lfs ls-files"

Trials involving several arms, or randomized trials, treat randomly-selected groups of patients with different therapies in order to compare their medical outcomes. Experimental arms, which receive an experimental drug, are compared with control arms. Single-arm or non-randomized trials, in which everyone enrolled in a trial receives the experimental therapy\nArtifacts - objects that are created as a result of a process. e.g. model objects, cleaned data sets, visuals, etc.\nAsynchronous Programming - code runs (or must run) after something else happens and also not sequentially (e.g. when a function calls a callback function in JS).\nAthena - amazon query service that works with S3. Best for analyses using kubernetes. ODBC drivers are best with interactive app\nB2C, B2B - business-to-consumer, business-to-business, describes a business that’s end-product is being sold to a consumer or a business.\nBalanced Design (aka orthogonal) has an equal number of observations for all possible level combinations. For example in an experiment where gender is an independent variable, an equal number of males receive the treatment as do females receive treatment. If the male/female counts were unequal, then the experiment is unbalanced.\n\nStat tests have greater power for balanced designs\nTest stat less susceptible to to small departures from the assumption of equal variances (homoscedasticity).\n\nBatch - collect a large number of data points, process them periodically and store results somewhere (contrasts with real-time in which a data input leads to an immediate prediction)\nBootstrapping (CS) - usually applies to a situation where a system depends on itself to start, sort of a chicken and egg problem.

This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.\nComplete Factorial Design - a research study involving two or more independent variables in which every possible combination of the levels of each variable is represented. For instance, in a study of two drug treatments, one (A) having two dosages and the other (B) having three dosages, a complete factorial design would pair the dosages administered to different individuals or groups of participants as follows: A1 with B1, A1 with B2, A1 with B3, A2 with B1, A2 with B2, and A2 with B3.\nCPG - Consumer packaged goods are items used daily by average consumers that require routine replacement or replenishment, such as food, beverages, clothes, tobacco, makeup, and household products.\nCPC - Cost Per Click - refers to the cost an advertiser pays each time an online user clicks on his or her digital ad\nCRM - customer relationship management i.e. customer service. Salesforce tracks this data. Example: what features your salesperson promised, and when? How much revenue you have from each customer? Or which salesperson sold the most in the past year?\ncron- standard tool used on Unix and Unix-like systems to schedule the periodic execution in the background of a command or script (like a batch script)\nCrossed Factors - when every category of one factor co-occurs in the design with every category of the other factor. In other words, there is at least one observation in every combination of categories for the two factors. (in contrast to “nested factors”). As a consequence, interaction terms involving these two factors is allowed.\nCrossover Study - A type of clinical trial in which the study participants receive each treatment in a random order. With this type of study, every patient serves as his or her own control. Crossover studies are often used when researchers feel it would be difficult to recruit participants willing to risk going without a promising new treatment.\nCross-Section Data - randomly sampled data from a population. Like a survey. Aka observational data. See experimental data for comparison.\n\nPooled - differs from panel data in that it is observations of different subjects (instead of the same subjects) in different time periods.\nRolling - both the presence of an individual in the sample and the time at which the individual is included in the sample are determined randomly.\n\nCross-Tabs - section of survey analysis where the aggregated results are broken down by demography, party affiliation, etc.\nCTA - marketing term, call-to-action. any device designed to prompt an immediate response or encourage an immediate sale; words or phrases that can be incorporated into sales scripts, advertising messages or web pages that encourage consumers to take prompt action\nCTR - click through rate: the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement.

Determined by measuring the correlation between the variable and residuals of the model. If a predictor variable hasn’t been randomly assigned, it’s likely to be endogenous.\nEquitability - concept that says a dependence measure should give equal importance to linear and nonlinear relationships. Consistent strength measurements across different variable relationships that have similar amounts of noise.\nERP - enterprise resource planning, sort of a catch-all for manufacturing, supply-chain, etc, see the wiki\nETL - extract, transfer, load - usually refers to transferring data from one location to another\nEndpoint (biostats) - Outcome variable measured in a medical study. e.g. Death, stroke, or quality of life are good endpoints. Blood tests and images on scans are not good endpoints.\n\nA composite endpoint is one that consists of two or more events\n\nExample: death due to cardiovascular causes or hospitalization due to heart failure\n\nSo the binary outcome would be a 1 if either of those events took place or a 0 if they did not. Or in a survival model, time until either of those events.\n\n\n\nEOF - End of file - Input from a terminal never really “ends” (unless the device is disconnected), but it is useful to enter more than one “file” into a terminal, so a key sequence is reserved to indicate end of input.\nex ante - based on assumption and prediction and being essentially subjective and estimative\nex post - based on knowledge and retrospection and being essentially objective and factual\nExperimental Data - data from a RCE/RCT. Compare with observational data\nFaaS - Function as a service - type of cloud service for developing, running, and managing apps (e.g. AWS Lambda)\nFactorial Design - Experiment where you’re interested in the effect of two or more independent variables.\nFraud Rules - fraud scores are calculated based on rules, which add or subtract points.

Rules look at data points such as an email address, IP address, or social media presence.\nFraud Score - assigned values to how risky a user action is. Scoring determined by fraud rules.\nFuzzy Design - See Sharp Design\nGMV - Gross merchandises value - the total value of merchandise sold over a given period of time through a customer-to-customer (C2C) exchange site\nGRP - Gross Rating Point. A standard measure in advertising, it measures advertising impact. You calculate it as a percent of the target market reached multiplied by the exposure frequency. Thus, if you get advertise to 30% of the target market and give them 4 exposures, you would have 120 GRP.\nHTE - Heterogeneous Treatment Effect - Also called differential treatment effect, includes difference of means, odds ratios, and Hazard ratios for time-to-event outcome vars\n\nAscertaining subpopulations for which a treatment is most beneficial (or harmful) is an important goal of many clinical trials.\nOutcome heterogeneity is due to wide distributions of baseline prognostic factors. When strong risk factors exist, there is hetergeneity in the outcome variable.\n\nSolution: add baseline predictors to your model that account for these strong risk factors.\n\nHeterogeneity of Treatment Effects - The degree to which different treatments have differential causal effects on each unit.\n\nHit Ratio - percent of records that were read in order to complete a query in a database.

Avoids overoptimistic estimates of the efficacy of an intervention resulting from the removal of non-compliers by accepting that noncompliance and protocol deviations are likely to occur in actual clinical practice. So mimics likely situation in the real world, but not good for estimating the causal effect of a treatment.\nKernels - (article) - system kernels - the interface between the operating system, i.e. the software, and the hardware components in a device. It is used in all devices with an operating system, for example, computers, laptops, smartphones, smartwatches, etc.\n\nWhen we use a program on a computer, such as Excel, we handle it on the so-called Graphical User Interface (GUI). The program converts every button click or other action into machine code and sends it to the operating system kernel. If we want to add a new column in an Excel table, this call goes to the system core. This in turn passes the call on to the computer processing unit (CPU), which executes the action.\nJupyter Kernels - an engine that executes notebook code and is specific to a particular programming language (e.g. python kernel)\nKaggle Kernels - a free platform from Kaggle to run Jupyter notebooks in the browser. Advantage is that you don’t have to set-up an environment locally.\n\nKPI- key performance indicator\nKYC - Know-Your-Customer is info a company collects to verify your identity to combat fraud. Used by telecoms and financial services\nLazy Evaluation - ” never pulls data into R unless you explicitly ask for it. It delays doing any work until the last possible moment. It collects together everything you want to do and then sends it to the database in one step.”\nLikelihood - probability of seeing this data given a specific value for a distribution parameter (eg mean, sd). Goal is to search for parameter values until the likelihood is maximized.\nLOB - Line of Business is a general term which refers to a product or a set of related products that serve a particular customer transaction or business need. (i.e. product categories)\n\nExamples\n\nConsumer Banking: credit cards, line of credit or loan program, mortgages, and corporate, small business and personal bank accounts.\nFinancial services and brokerages: mergers and acquisitions or partnerships, real estate investments, and wealth management\nProperty and casualty insurance companies: property and casualty insurance (i.e., homeowners, car, boat, renters, etc.), life insurance, health insurance, and commercial business insurance.\n\nSub-lines of Business would be sub-categories within each LOB\n\nLongitudinal Data - see panel data\nLTV - see CLV/CLTV\nManual Review - A human is reviews the case to determine whether action is needed. In fraud, an model output may trigger a “manual review” to determine whether an event was indeed fraudulent.\nMLlib - Apache Spark machine learning library\nMVC - Minimum Viable Corpus - a data size threshold; such that below this threshold, the data simply isn’t useful/valuable.

It is often performed right after each update or commit to the code base to identify new bugs and ensure that your system works properly.\nRFI - Request for Information - Used to collect written information about the capabilities of various suppliers. Normally it follows a format that can be used for comparative purposes. An RFI is primarily used to gather information to help make a decision on what steps to take next.

Since this is ecommerce, I doubt this will be a problem.\n\nHow their conversion looks like vs the users who don’t do what you want them to do\n\nso you can hypothesize whether or not engaging more users with this part of a journey can have a positive impact on the business, or on conversion in this case.\n\n\nAnswer template\n\n“Users who do X tend to have a # times higher conversion rate compared to users who don’t do X. That said, there’s only Y percent of users who do X. We can either analyze the behavior of those users and try to attract more similar users to use our product, or funnel more users to do X.”\n\nProcess:\n\nFilter conversion metrics (See example 22) by page or feature\nExamine conversion range between those that visit the page/use the feature and those that don’t\n\nExample: Over this period,\n\nBetween 3.97 – 5.73% of users visit the “Store search results” page (a proxy for search), but\n\ntheir user conversion rate  is 0.9 - 7.3%\n\nUsers who don’t visit that page have a user conversion rate between 0.5% - 2.4%\nMe: I think with this webpage/feature it would be safe to ignore the time aspect and perform difference-in-means test or a cohen’s d standardized test to see if and how much these conversion rates differ.\n\nAlthough, viewing as line chart can indicate when various periods of seasonality for product are.\n\n\n\nWhen you find a sizable difference between these groups. Ask:\n\nWhat else makes those users different?\nWhat else they do on the app?\nWhere they come from?\nHow can you help them connect with the product they may be interested in?\n\nBeware: making the page visitation/feature usage mandatory (e.g. a user must visit the login page before purchasing) usually will decrease conversion\n\n\n\nCan also look at webpages/features that adversely affect conversion. (e.g. “Page Unavailable”)\n\nMight be useful to see how these events affect CLV, retention, etc.\n\n\nExample 24\n\nPower User Analysis\n\n% users vs views\n\nShows what percent of users view a page/feature vs number of views for a given time period\n\n\nFrom Looking for Power User Journeys\nAlso see Product Development &gt;&gt; Metrics &gt;&gt; Growth Metrics &gt;&gt; Power User Curve\nYou either want the mode of these charts to shift to the right or you want a smile pattern with modes on the far left and far right\n\nUsers in the far right mode are considered “power users.”\n\nIdentify features correlated with conversion (example 23) and moniter these features’ power user curves to measure progress in producing more power users and therefore more conversions\n\nCan also be broken down be cohorts (see Algorithms, Product &gt;&gt; Cohort Analysis)\n\nProduct Details Pages (PDP)\n\nAround 50% of users in January 2021 viewed 2 PDPs\nSee example 21 &gt;&gt; CTE &gt;&gt; unnested_events_categorized for SQL code to create a PDP category. (collapses various product detail webpages into a PDP category)\nAn online business wants mode of this chart to move to the right (i.e. funnel users to PDP pages), since view of PDPs are positively correlated with conversion\n\n\nExample 25\n\nDiagnosing path lengths in user journeys\n\nLong user journeys may be because of active browsing or it may be a sign of a user getting lost\n\nFrom Looking for Power User Journeys\nWhen a user first visits a webpage, which is necessary for conversion (e.g. Product Listing Page), towards the end of a long journey, then something has likely gone wrong.\n\ni.e. they’re likely have trouble finding the PLP.\n\nSee Example 21 &gt;&gt; final query for code that ranks each webpage in the user journey according to when it’s first visited. (most of the cleaning code in the CTE will also likely be required.)\nPLP: % session vs first seen rank during a session\n\nY axis: % of sessions\nX axis: “page_rank_session_first_seen”\n\nPotential ranks for a webpage during a session\nLow ranks = the webpage is first viewed towards the beginning of the session\nHigh ranks = the webpage is first viewed towards the end of the session\n\n** Note that the ranks on the x-axis are ordered according to their y-axis values (highest to lowest) **\n\nSo don’t interpret the chart as a distribution\n\nInterpretation: a large proportion of user sessions are viewing the PLP very early in the user journey, they’re likely landing on this page from paid search (e.g. Google)\n\ni.e. the ranks with the highest % session values are low ranks (Top 5 ranks are 1,3,4,5,6)\n\n\nStore Search Page: % session vs first seen rank during a session\n\nSame axis descriptions as in PLP example\nInterpretation: The search page is visited mostly as the 3rd, 4th, or 5th page visited, so it’s early enought that users are likely not having a tough time finding it and may and prefer to engage with it rather than browse the navigation bar.\n\nCheckout page: % session vs first seen rank during a session\n\nSame axis descriptions as in PLP example\nInterpretation: There is large range (10 to 43) of relatively equally likely path lengths before conversion\n\n\nExample 26: Segment User Purchases as New Customers or Returning Customers\n\nCustomers are users that have purchased (i.e. converted)\nData is Google Merchandise Store\nBuild a base table with orders by customer and date\n\n\nWITH base_table AS (\n-- orders by customer and date   \n    SELECT\n      user_pseudo_id AS user_id,\n      ecommerce.transaction_id AS order_id,\n      PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', event_date) AS order_date\n    FROM\n      `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`\n    WHERE\n      event_name = 'purchase'\n      AND ecommerce.transaction_id &lt;&gt; '(not set)'\n    GROUP BY\n      1,\n      2,\n      3\n)\n\nData is filtered to only include rows representing purchases with a valid transaction id.\n\nGoogle Analytics will store a default “(not set)” value if the data isn’t accessible, isn’t being tracked properly, or for other reasons.\n\nResults are then grouped across all three dimensions so that each row represents a unique order per client per date\nLabel customers as ‘new’ or ‘returning’\n\nSELECT\n  *,\n  CASE\n    WHEN DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY order_date) = 1 \n    THEN 'new' ELSE 'returning'\nEND\n  AS customer_type\nFROM\n  `datastic.new_existing.base_table`\n\nDENSE_RANK() allows us to assign the same rank to multiple orders made on the same day.\nOn September 12, 2020, the customer 13285520 makes the first order and was given the label ‘new’.\nThen, on December 12, 2020, this same customer makes a second order, which resulted in having a ‘returning’ type."

Explorations is for querying which allows you to drill down and answer questions. (i.e. EDA)\nSome dimensions and metrics available in reports aren’t supported in explorations\nReports that use the aggregated data tables are always based on 100% of the available data. Explorations, on the other hand, may apply sampling when querying user and event level data if the size of your query exceeds 10 million events.\n\nShortening the date range of the explorations can reduce the size of the population to which sampling is applied, resulting in higher accuracy.\n\nMight have slightly different results when running queries for the past 48 hours, due to processing time differences in different Analytics systems.\n\nResources\n\nGA4 Dimensions and Metrics Docs\nGoogle API Dimensions and Metrics\nGoogle Analytics Glossary, Events Glossary, Metrics Glossary\nGoogle search for glossaries\nChannels, Sources, and Mediums Glossary\nMeasure eCommerce - set up ecommerce events to collect information about the shopping behavior of your users\nSet up a purchase event - set up a purchase event on your website so you can measure when someone makes a purchase\n\nNot every metric can be combined with every dimension.\n\nEach dimension and metric has a scope: user-level, session-level, or hit-level.\nIn most cases, it only makes sense to combine dimensions and metrics that share the same scope.\nReference for valid pairs\n\nGA4 retains 2 months of data by default. You can adjust this by going to Admin &gt;&gt; Data Settings &gt;&gt; Data Retention\nThe cross-channel last click attribution model is Google’s basic last-click attribution model with a slight twist: it excludes direct traffc (traffic that is unattributed) except when no other data is available.\nGoogle Analytics data in BigQuery (info for GA360 not GA4)\n\nGA4 Docs for exporting to BigQuery\nNote that the Big Query export table with Google Analytics data is a nested table at session level for GA360 and at the event level for GA4\n\nnested information contains actions and metrics for a specific customer within a session\n\nExample: query for session level features\nExample: unnested query for hit level features\n\n\nTerms\n\nCohort - group of users who share a common characteristic identified by an Analytics dimension\nDimension - categorical value; category to group_by in the calculation of a metric\n\ne.g. sesssions per country where country is the dimension\n\nEngagement \n\nUser engagement is the length of time that your app is in the foreground or webpage is in focus so you can understand the time that users spend engaged with your content.\nEngaged sessions are sessions that last 10 seconds or longer, have one or more conversion events, or have two or more views\n\n“First User” - naming convention for acquisition attributes of a user (aka a first time user). There is no “first user” dimension. It’s a prefix that describes dimensions that measure how the website first acquires a user. These values don’t change when a user returns to your app or website.\nInteraction - any touch point with an element on a website\nMedium: the general category of the source\n\nexamples: organic search (organic, i.e. unpaid search), cost-per-click paid search (cpc, i.e. paid search), web referral (referral),  (custom medium), none (direct traffic).\n\nppc: pay-per-click\nreferral: any traffic coming from another website that’s NOT Pay-Per-Click (PPC)/Cost-per-Thousand (CPM) (i.e. ads) or a search engine\n\ne.g. link in an article or video description on Facebook, TripAdvisor, etc.\n\n\n\nMetric - numeric value; usually a count or calculated value like a rate or average that’s aggregated per dimension value\n\ne.g. average conversions per device where average conversion is the metric\n\nNew Users - Users on your site or app for the first time\n\nanyone who doesn’t have both a Google Analytics cookie and Client ID from your site or App Instance ID from your app\n\n“(not set)” (docs) - Google Analytics will store a default (not set) value if the data isn’t accessible, isn’t being tracked properly, or for other reasons.\nSegments -  website variables that you can filter the data in order to perform calculations on various user subgroups\n\nThink the term comes from “customer segmentation”\nDocs\n\nAlso shows how to build custom segments\n\nTypes\n\nSystem - provided segments from Google\nCustom - you can edit, copy/paste system segments to build segments or create one from scratch\n\nAlso see Analytics Solutions Gallery\n\na free marketplace where Analytics users share segments and other solutions they’ve developed\n\n\n\nScopes\n\nA user can be involved in multiple sessions and a session can contain multiple hits\nUsers - People interact with your property (e.g., your website or app)\n\nBehavior across all sessions within the date range you’re using, up to 93 days\ne.g. all the goals users completed or all the revenue they generated (across all sessions) during the date range.\n\nSessions - Interactions by a single user are grouped into sessions.\n\nBehavior within a single session\ne.g. the goals that users completed during a session, or the amount of revenue they generated during a session.\n\nHits - Interactions during a session are referred to as hits. Hits include interactions like pageviews, events, and transactions.\n\nBehavior confined to a single action\ne.g. viewing a page or starting a video.\n\n\n\nSequenced Segment - sequence-based segmentT\n\nThink this is primarily used to create funnels pre-GA4, but can still be used in the “Blank” or “Free Form” template of Explore\n\nSee Segment Docs for pre-GA4\n\n\nSession - A single period of time a user is active on your site or app\n\n2 methods for how a session can be ended:\n\nTime-based expiration:\n\nAfter 30 minutes of inactivity if someone is inactive on your website for over 30 minutes, then a new session will be reported if they perform another interaction, for example, viewing another page * This explains how in a Path Exploration (see below) there are paths that go from session_start to page_view to session_start (i.e. the user left the tab open because they had to do something else, and after 30 minutes came back and interacted with the web page)\nAt midnight\n\nCampaign change:\n\nIf a user arrives via one campaign, leaves, and then comes back via a different campaign.\n\n\n\nSource -  the origin of your traffic, such as a search engine (for example, google) or a domain (example.com)\nUsers - Returning users who have been processed by Analytics. Sometimes it’s Active Users.\nUTM - Urchin Traffic Monitor - used to identify marketing channels or results from ad campaigns\n\ne.g. http://yourwebsite.com/your-post-title/?utm_source=google\n\nutm code = string after “?”\n\nseparate each UTM parameter with the ‘&’ sign.\n\nThis person clicked a google ad to get to your site\n\nName comes from Urchin Tracker, a web analytics software that served as the base for Google Analytics.\nGoogle URL builder tool\nSee article for me details, best practices, etc.\nParameter types\n\nutm_source - traffic source (e.g. google, facebook, twitter, etc.)\nutm_medium - type of traffic source (e.g. CPC, email, social, referral, display, etc.)\nutm_campaign - campaign name, track the performance of a specific campaign\nutm___content - In case you have multiple links pointing to the same URL (such as an email with two CTA buttons), this code will help you track which link was clicked (e.g utm_content=navlink )\nutm_term - track which keyword term a website visitor came from. This parameter is specifically used for paid search ads. (e.g. utm_term=growth+hacking+tactics)\n\n\n\nSegments, Dimensions, and Metrics\n\nSegments:\n\nMisc\n\nRecommended segments\n\neach geo-region (e.g. state or county), each product, each product-page, each source-medium (e.g. newsletter)\n\nUseful to compare segments\n\ne.g. compare the behavior differences between “visitors that stayed longer than 5 minutes” on your website and “visitors that stayed less than 1 minute.”\n\ncan apply up to four segments at a time to any report\nmaximum date range of 93 days to your reports\n\nSegments based on the Date of First Session option are limited to maximum range of 31 days\n\nreports are on only the first 1000 sessions for each user.\n\ncounts beyond 1000 in a 93-day period are usually an indication of non-human traffic\n\nDo not use segments with Multi-Channel Funnel reports. Use Conversion segments instead.\nGoogle Ads cost data is not compatible with segments. If you apply a segment to a Google Ads report that includes cost data, then the cost data all have zero values.\n\n\nDimensions:\n\nAny event: the user has at least 1 event within the exploration time period.\nAny transaction: the user has at least 1 transaction event within the exploration time period,\nAny conversion: the user has at least 1 conversion event within the exploration time period.\nEvent Category - something that describes the group of event actions and event labels\nEvent Action - e.g. button click, image hover, tap, etc.\nEvent Label - name of a product, navbar, sign-up form, etc.\nFirst Touch (acquisition date): the first time the user visited your app or website, as measured by this Google Analytics property.\nFirst user medium - The medium by which the user was first acquired, based on the Cross-channel last click attribution model (see Misc).\nFirst open - when a user opens the app for the first time\n\nFind out how many users have installed your app\n\nFirst Visit (app, web) - the first time a user visits a website\nMobile Traffic - users that use a mobile device to visit your site\n\nfind out if the ‘time on page’ is what it should be as this might say something about the mobile friendliness of your site\n\nOrganic Traffic - all visitors that came from an organic search result to your site\n\nuseful for finding which landing pages these users visit\n\nSession Medium - The medium that initiated a session on your website or app (i.e. current “last touch” for that user; see First Touch for contrast)\n\nMetrics:\n\nActive Users - number of unique users who performed sessions on your website within the exploration time frame\n\nSeems to be a smaller number than “total users”\na user who has an engaged session or when Analytics collects:\n\nthe first_visit event or engagement_time_msec parameter from a website\nthe first_open event or engagement_time_msec parameter from an Android app\nthe first_open or user_engagement event from an iOS app\n\n\nAverage Click Rate - average number of times an element is interacted with, within a session\n\nUsed to understand pain points\n\nIf an element that should only be clicked once or twice has a high number of avg. clicks this can be an indication of either the user becoming stuck or clicking out of frustration.\n\nAvg CR = Total Events / Unique Dimension Combinations (see Example 6)\n\nAverage Engagement Time - sum of user engagement durations divided by the number of active users\nBounce Rate - the percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page.\n\nHigh bounce rate can indicate the landing page needs improvement\nIf the bounces occur not just on the home page but all around the site, the high bounce rate may signal the need for a recommendation module.\n\nIf a viewer sees a recommendation on the product page, this may induce them to view more pages which lowers the bounce rat\n\n\nClick Through Rate (CTR) - can be defined multiple ways\n\nnumber of clicks / number of impressions\nnumber of unique users clicked / number of unique users that visited the page\nnumber of clicks of ad viewers / total number of ad viewer\n\nEngaged sessions: The number of sessions that lasted 10 seconds or longer, or had 1 or more conversion events or 2 or more page views.\nEngagement Rate: engaged sessions / sessions\nEvent Count - the number of events triggered across all users and all sessions in the exploration time frame\nInteraction Rate - the percentage of people that interact (click, hover, tap) with an element.\n\nHelps analysts find areas on websites or apps where the customer may be having trouble which may affect conversion rate\nIf a button, etc. breaks, the development team can understand how urgent getting this element fixed is\nIR = (Unique Dimension Combinations * 100) / Sessions (see Example 6)\n\nPower Users: people who love their product, are highly engaged, and contribute a ton of value to the network\n\nEngagement = DAU/MAU\n\nDAU: Daily Active Users\nMAU: Monthly Active Users\nGuideline: apps over 20% are said to be good, and 50%+ is world class\n\nUse: Product is used daily\n\nRecency of Events (inverse of a “days since” feature) - a customer that just visited your website is probably more keen to purchase than one that visited it 3 months ago\n\nRFM (recency, frequency monetary value) theory wiki\nRecency since last session = 1 / Number of days since last session\n\nHighest value = 1 (i.e. lower is worse)\n\nRecency since last session with at least one interaction with  = same formula except you change the denominator to this count of days since this event\n** There will be 0s in the denominator for some users, so those recency values need to be changed to zero or the 0 counts replaced with a really small fraction ** Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)\nROAS = Sales Revenue / Advertising Budget Spend\n\nSessions: The number of sessions that began on your site or app (the session_start event was triggered).\nTotal Events - total number of events with the same event category, event action, and event label across all sessions\nTotal Users - represents the number of unique users who viewed a screen or triggered an event in the exploration time frame\n\nIf a user repeats an interaction with the same node, then they only count as 1 user at that node.\n\nExample: when a user opens the home page, navigates to a product page, and then returns to the home page before navigating to another product page within the time frame selected, the path will show one home page user on the starting point and one product page user for each product in the first step\n\n\nUnique Dimension Combinations (UDC) - The unique number of sessions that have interacted with a combination of events.\n\nDiffers from unique events in that the number depends on which dimensions the view is grouped on. (see Example 6)\n**If in doubt on whether to use unique events or unique dimension combination, use Unique Dimension Combinations.**\n\nUDC probably answers more business questions, and it also matches the values for UE in some queries.\n\n\nUnique Events - total number of nonrepeated events with the same event category, event action, and event label across all sessions\nUnique User Scrolls - the number of unique users who scrolled down at least 90% of the page\nUser Engagement - sum of user engagement durations divided by the number of triggered events\nViews - the number of app screens or web pages your users saw.\n\nRepeated views of a screen or page are counted\nViews = screen_view + page_view\n\n\n\nReports\n\nMisc\n\nDocs\nReports are for monitoring key metrics. Explorations is for querying which allows you to drill down and answer questions. (i.e. EDA)\nEach Dimension category has it’s own page.

Example: their first visit or purchase date, or the campaign by which they were acquired as a user.\nMost recent interactions: data associated with the last time the user was measured for a property.\n\nExample: their last activity or purchase date.\n\nLifetime interactions: data aggregated over the lifetime of the user.\n\nExample: their lifetime revenue or engagement\n\nPredictive metrics: data generated through machine learning to predict user behavior:\n\nPurchase probability\nIn app purchase probability\nChurn probability Example (User-ID): Suppose a signed in user had multiple visits to your app last year, and conducted multiple transactions worth a total of $1,000. Suppose that this same user also had 4 transactions conducted as a guest (not signed in), each worth $50, and that each transaction was made on a different device. Finally, suppose this user visited your app while signed in at least once in the date range selected by your query. How this user appears in the user lifetime exploration depends on the reporting identity method used: With User-ID, Google signals, then device: this user is counted once, with revenue of $1000, as only her signed in data is applicable to the exploration. Her average lifetime revenue would be $1,000.\nWith device only: this user appears 5 times: one with revenue of $1000, and 4 times with revenue of $50. Her average lifetime revenue would be $240."

The data warehouse can be shared among the entire organization including people who don’t necessarily understand SQL but still try to look for information. An alert is to warn them about the low-quality of the query and Data Engineers can help them with good SQL practices.\nspot expensive/heavy scheduled queries at the early stage. It’s going to be risky if a scheduled query is very expensive. Having the alerting in place can prevent a high bill at the end of the month.\nunderstand the resource utilization and do a better job on capacity planning.\n\nGuide\n\n“Bytes shuffled” affects query time; “Bytes processed” affects query cost\n\nLIMIT speeds up performance, but doesn’t reduce costs\n\nFor data exploration, consider using BigQuery’s (free) table preview option instead.\nThe row restriction of LIMIT clause is applied after SQL databases scan the full range of data. Here’s the kicker — most distributed database (including BigQuery) charges based on the data scans but not the outputs, which is why LIMIT doesn’t help save a dime.\nTable Preview\n\n\nallows you to navigate the table page by page, up to 200 rows at a time and it’s completely free\n\n\nAvoid using SELECT * . Choose only the relevant columns that you need to avoid unnecessary, costly full table scans\n\nWith row-based dbs, all columns get read anyway, but with columnar dbs, like BigQuery, you don’t have to read every column.\n\nUse EXISTS instead of COUNT when checking if a value is present\n\nIf you don’t need the exact count, use EXISTS() because it exits the processing cycle as soon as the first matching row is found\n\nSELECT EXISTS (\n  SELECT\n    number\n  FROM\n    `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.blocks`\n  WHERE\n    timestamp BETWEEN \"2018-12-01\" AND \"2019-12-31\"\n    AND number = 6857606\n)\nUse Approximate Aggregate Functions\n\nWhen you have a big dataset and you don’t need the exact count, use approximate aggregate functions instead\nUnlike the usual brute-force approach, approximate aggregate functions use statistics to produce an approximate result instead of an exact result.\n\nExpects the error rate to be ~ 1 to 2%.\n\nAPPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT()\nAPPROX_QUANTILES()\nAPPROX_TOP_COUNT()\nAPPROX_TOP_SUM()\nHYPERLOGLOG++\n\nSELECT\n  APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(miner)\nFROM\n  `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.blocks`\nWHERE\n  timestamp BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2020-01-01'\nReplace Self-Join with Windows Function\n\nSelf-join are always inefficient and should only be used when absolutely necessary. In most cases, we can replace it with a window function.\nA self-join is when a table is joined with itself.\n\nThis is a common join operation when we need a table to reference its own data, usually in a parent-child relationship.\n\nExample\nWITH\n  cte_table AS (\n  SELECT\n    DATE(timestamp) AS date,\n    miner,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT number) AS block_count\n  FROM\n    `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.blocks`\n  WHERE\n    DATE(timestamp) BETWEEN \"2022-03-01\"\n    AND \"2022-03-31\"\n  GROUP BY\n    1,2\n  )\n\n/* self-join */\nSELECT\n  a.miner,\n  a.date AS today,\n  a.block_count AS today_count,\n  b.date AS tmr,\n  b.block_count AS tmr_count,\n  b.block_count - a.block_count AS diff\nFROM\n  cte_table a\nLEFT JOIN\n  cte_table b\n  ON\n    DATE_ADD(a.date, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = b.date\n    AND a.miner = b.miner\nORDER BY\n  a.miner,\n  a.date\n\n/* optimized */\nSELECT\n  miner,\n  date AS today,\n  block_count AS today_count,\n  LEAD(date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY miner ORDER BY date) AS tmr,\n  LEAD(block_count, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY miner ORDER BY date) AS tmr_count,\n  LEAD(block_count, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY miner ORDER BY date) - block_count AS diff\nFROM\n  cte_table a\n\nORDER BY or JOIN on INT64 columns if you can\n\nWhen your use case supports it, always prioritize comparing INT64 because it’s cheaper to evaluate INT64 data types than strings.\nIf the join keys belong to certain data types that are difficult to compare, then the query becomes slow and expensive.\ni.e. join on an int instead of a string\n\nInstead of NOT IN , use NOT EXISTS operator to write anti-joins because it triggers a more resource-friendly query execution plan\n\nanti-join  - a JOIN operator with an exclusion clause WHERE NOT IN , WHERE NOT EXISTS, etc) that removes rows if it has a match in the second table.\nSee article for an example\n\nIn any complex query, filter the data as early in the query as possible\n\nApply filtering functions early and often in your query to reduce data shuffling and wasting compute resources on irrelevant data that doesn’t contribute to the final query result\ne.g. SELECT DISTINCT , INNER JOIN , WHERE , GROUP BY\n\nExpressions in your WHERE clauses should be ordered with the most selective expression first\n\nDoesn’t matter except for edge cases (e.g. the example below didn’t result in a faster query) such as:\n\nIf you have a large number of tables in your query (10 or more).\nIf you have several EXISTS, IN, NOT EXISTS, or NOT IN statements in your WHERE clause\nIf you are using nested CTE (common table expressions) or a large number of CTEs.\nIf you have a large number of sub-queries in your FROM clause.\n\nNot optimized\nWHERE\n  miner LIKE '%a%'\n  AND miner LIKE '%b%'\n  AND miner = '0xc3348b43d3881151224b490e4aa39e03d2b1cdea'\n\nThe LIKE expressions are string searches which are expensive so they should be towards the end\nThe expression with the “=” operator is the “most selective” expression since it’s for a particular value of “miner,” so it should be near the beginning\n\nOptimized\nWHERE\n  miner = '0xc3348b43d3881151224b490e4aa39e03d2b1cdea'\n  AND miner LIKE '%a%'\n  AND miner LIKE '%b%'\n\nUtilize PARTITIONS and/or CLUSTERS to significantly reduce amount of data that’s scanned - Clustering divides the table into even smaller chunks than partition - A Clustered Table sorts the data into blocks based on the column (or columns) that we choose and then keeps track of the data through a clustered index. - During a query, the clustered index points to the blocks that contain the data, therefore allowing BigQuery to skip through irrelevant ones. The process of skipping irrelevant blocks on scanning is known as block pruning.\n\nMisc\n\nAlso see\n\nDB, Engineering &gt;&gt; Cost Optimization &gt;&gt; Partitions and Indexes for CLUSTER\nSQL &gt;&gt; Partitions\nPartitioning Docs\nClustering Docs\n\nNotes from\n\noriginal optimization article\nHow to Use Partitions and Clusters in BigQuery Using SQL\n\nUse BOTH partitions and clusters on tables that are bigger than 1 GB to segment and order the data.\n\nFor big tables, it’s beneficial to both partition and cluster.\n\nLimits\n\n4,000 partitions per table\n4 cluster columns per table\n\nInfo about partititoning and cluster located in Details tab of your table\n\n\nPartitioning\n\nMisc\n\nPartition columns should always be picked based on how you expect to use the data, and not depending on which column would evenly split the data based on size.\n\nExample: partition on county because your analysis or transformations will largely be done by county even though since some counties may be much larger than others and will cause the partitions to be substantially imbalanced.\n\n\nTypes of Partition Keys\n\nTime-unit column: Tables are partitioned based on a time value such as timestamps or dates.\nIngestion time: Tables are partitioned based on the timestamp when BigQuery ingests the data.\nInteger range: Tables are partitioned based on a number.\n\nExample: Partition by categorical\nCREATE TABLE database.zoo_partitioned\nPARTITION BY zoo_name AS\n  (SELECT *\n  FROM database.zoo)\nExample: Partition by date\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE\n  `datastic.stackoverflow.questions_partitioned`\nPARTITION BY\nDATE_TRUNC(creation_date,MONTH) AS (\n  SELECT\n  *\n  FROM\n  `datastic.stackoverflow.questions`)\n\n“creation_date” is truncated to a month which reduces the number of partitions needed for this table\n\nDays would exceed the 4000 partition limit\n\nPartition Options\n\npartition_expiration_days: BigQuery deletes the data in a partition when it expires. This means that data in partitions older than the number of days specified here will be deleted.\nrequire_partition_filter: Users can’t query without filtering (WHERE clause) on your partition key.\n\nExample: Set options\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE\n  `datastic.stackoverflow.questions_partitioned`\nPARTITION BY\nDATE_TRUNC(creation_date,MONTH) OPTIONS(partition_expiration_days=180,\n    require_partition_filter=TRUE) AS (\n  SELECT\n    *\n  FROM\n    `datastic.stackoverflow.questions`)\n\nALTER TABLE\n  `datastic.stackoverflow.questions_partitioned`\nSET\n  OPTIONS(require_partition_filter=FALSE,partition_expiration_days=10)\n\n\nClustering\n\nBest with values that have high cardinality, which means columns with various possible values such as emails, user ids, names, categories of a product, etc…\nAble cluster on multiple columns and you can cluster different data types (STRING, DATE, NUMERIC, etc…)\nExample: Cluster by categorical\nCREATE TABLE database.zoo_clustered\nCLUSTER BY animal_name AS\n  (SELECT *\n  FROM database.zoo)\nExample: Cluster by tag\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE\n  `datastic.stackoverflow.questions_clustered`\nCLUSTER BY tags AS ( \n  SELECT\n    *\n  FROM\n    `datastic.stackoverflow.questions`)\n\nPartition and Cluster\n\nExample\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE\n  `datastic.stackoverflow.questions_partitioned_clustered`\nPARTITION BY\n  DATE_TRUNC(creation_date,MONTH)\nCLUSTER BY\n  tags AS (\n  SELECT\n    *\n  FROM\n    `datastic.stackoverflow.questions`)\n\n\nUse ORDER BY only in the outermost query or within window clauses (analytic functions)\n\nOrdering is a resource intensive operation that should be left until the end since tables tend to be larger at the beginning of the query.\nBigQuery’s SQL Optimizer isn’t affected by this because it’s smart enough to recognize and run the order by clauses at the end no matter where they’re written.\n\nStill a good practice though.\n\n\nPush complex operations, such as regular expressions and mathematical functions to the end of the query\n\ne.g. REGEXP_SUBSTR()  and SUM()\n\nUse SEARCH() for nested data\n\nCan search for relevant keywords without having to understand the underlying data schema\n\nTokenizes text data, making it exceptionally easy to find data buried in unstructured text and semi-structured JSON data\n\nTraditionally when dealing with nested structures, we need to understand the table schema in advance, then appropriately flatten any nested data with UNNEST() before running a combination of WHERE and REGEXP clause to search for specific terms. These are all compute-intensive operators.\nExample\n-- old way\nSELECT\n  `hash`,\n  size,\n  outputs\nFROM\n  `bigquery-public-data.crypto_bitcoin.transactions`\nCROSS JOIN\n  UNNEST(outputs)\nCROSS JOIN\n  UNNEST(addresses) AS outputs_address\nWHERE\n  block_timestamp_month BETWEEN \"2009-01-01\" AND \"2010-12-31\"\n  AND REGEXP_CONTAINS(outputs_address, '1LzBzVqEeuQyjD2mRWHes3dgWrT9titxvq')\n\n-- with search()\nSELECT\n  `hash`,\n  size,\n  outputs\nFROM\n  `bigquery-public-data.crypto_bitcoin.transactions`\nWHERE\n  block_timestamp_month BETWEEN \"2009-01-01\" AND \"2010-12-31\"\n  AND SEARCH(outputs, ‘`1LzBzVqEeuQyjD2mRWHes3dgWrT9titxvq`’)\nCreate a search index for the column to enable point-lookup text searches\n# To create the search index over existing BQ table\nCREATE SEARCH INDEX my_logs_index ON my_table (my_columns);\n\nCaching\n\nBigQuery has a cost-free, fully managed caching feature for our queries\nBigQuery automatically caches query results into a temporary table that lasts for up to 24 hours after the query has ran.\n\nCan toggle the feature through Query Settings on the Editor UI\n\nCan verify whether cached results are used by checking “Job Information” after running the query. The Bytes processed should display “0 B (results cached)”.\nNot all queries will be cached. Exceptions include: A query is not cached when it uses non-deterministic functions, such as CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), because it will return a different value depending on when the query is executed.\n\nWhen the table referenced by the query received streaming inserts because any changes to the table will invalidate the cached results. If you are querying multiple tables using a wildcard."

That’s why you need to give your team time to explore.\nTeam members can come to new and exciting conclusions when they’re given time to explore the data for fun. They can apply their talents to looking for patterns that no one has requested, and have the space to uncover new discoveries. This freeform exploration can lead to game-changing innovations that no business stakeholder would have imagined were possible.\nHelps keep your most valuable team members engaged and satisfied in their work.\n\nWhen first starting, request documentation\n\nRelevant server locations & descriptions\nLocations of our documentation and dashboards\nA list of tools/software that are available to be used\nA list of relevant stakeholders/gatekeepers that I’d need to make contact with\n\n\nTerms\n\nFocus Time - uninterrupted time, usually refers to a period of time (e.g. 2 hrs) where people can work without any distractions\nReport (aka Individual Contributor (IC))- People who report to the manager\n\nGetting the Promotion\n\nYou don’t get a promotion and THEN start to perform at the next level; you perform at the next level IN ORDER TO get a promotion.\n\nSo when you notice a gap somewhere, even if it doesn’t necessarily fall into your current role description, don’t be afraid to bring it up to your manager and discuss whether you can/should take initiative to help plug the gap.\nThe best way to notice gaps is to be a good listener and constantly communicate with your partners & stakeholders about their teams’ work and pain points.\n\nMentor a peer\n\nIf you have new members joining the team, offer to be an onboarding buddy to guide them through their first few weeks.\nbrainstorm with team members when then need help\n\nStep out of your immediate scope\nGet involved in team-level activities\n\nHelp out with things such as sprint planning, quarterly planning, etc.\n\nAllows you to gain knowledge about other team members’ work and other teams’ requests for your team\nGives you some exposure to the manager’s plan and vision for the team\n\nVolunteering for culture initiatives is a great way to practice thinking about the team as a whole\nTake on projects that help the whole team\n\nproduct design doc for the data product\nSLA agreement with partner teams (?)\nCodify the best practices you use in your own work\n\n\nHave open, timely feedback conversations with your manager\n\nAsk for the leveling guide when you have the initial career development conversation with your manager.\n\nAnd make sure you mention your aspiration to be a manager as soon as possible (don’t be shy) as well as your aspired timeline that you are working towards.\n\nAsk your manager for candid feedback with regards to their assessment of your readiness to become a manager, and any gaps that they think you need to address.\nIn followup career development check-ins, ask your manager to provide feedback for you against the leveling guide.\n\n\nManagerial Hats\nPeople manager **-** Learn what makes your direct reports (aka people that you manage) tick, identify their career aspirations, and point out opportunities for progress.\n\nResource manager - Determine what resources are needed and acquire them. Mostly this means recruiting, hiring, and onboarding, but it also means advocating for money for training and team activities.\n\nProject manager - Collect and triage projects and project requirements, set timetables and schedules, assigned tasks, and have the final say about when work was “done”.\n\nCommunications manager - Make sure the team’s work was being shared with the rest of the organization, and that everyone on the team knew what was going on outside.\n\nProcess manager - Help design the team’s processes to make sure we could identify, allot, do, and communicate work across the team.\n\nTechnical mentor and coach - A technical expert who reviews code, answers technical questions, and gives work feedback to my team.\nPreparation for a managerial role\n\nTake notes on the time needed to do difficult tasks, easy quick-wins, common roadblocks, and their solutions.\n\nThis will help estimate deadlines for new projects\n\nPractice verbal and written communication\nGather information on “big picture” strategy of your company and that applies to data projects\nTake notes of every data team member’s strengths and weaknesses\nListen to your colleagues.\n\nComplaints on a day-to-day basis.\nPraise about the workplace in general.\nPay attention to pet projects of your teammates: these are the areas they actively pursue outside their usual work.\n\n\nMeetings\n\nMeetings are bad when they:\n\nResult in calendar fragmentation.\n\nTry to schedule sometime after a Focus Time\nLimit size and number of meetings\n\n1-1s (1 on 1), team-wide update, or decision-making meetings\nLarge (&gt; 4 ppl) brainstorming meetings don’t work\n\nBetter to circulate a memo of come-up with options then debate those options during a meeting\n\n\n\nFeel useless to attendees\n\nKeep focus on the meetings agenda\n\nGroup meetings (manager’s agenda)\n1-1s (1 on 1) (report’s agenda)\n\n\n\n\nTools for Servant Leadership\n\nTeaching - As a leader you often have more context and more experience than your team members.\n\nTeach the team which situations different models work in, how those models are perceived in your organization and the red-flags to watch out for during development.\n\nReflecting - Make time to think back to events within your team.\n\nWhat caused success? What led to failure? Are we setting expectations appropriately for our models and analyses?\n\nDebate - Encourage debate.\n\nThe team is trying to use data to understand the world, and as in any form of science, there will be competing hypotheses\nTake advantage of the diversity (all forms) within our teams to minimize the impact of those personal biases\n\nProcess - Leaders will have to deal with ambiguity, but for the wider team we need to ensure there are steps to follow that support consistency across the team and alignment on the team’s over-arching goals.\nFeedback - To maintain team members’ morale, the balance between negative and positive feedback has to tilt heavily towards the positive\n\nIf you can’t find that balance, then you need to consider whether the team member should continue on your team. If you want them to remain, then you must figure out how to articulate their positives back to them, otherwise you can expect them to leave.\n\n\nNonviolent Communication (NVC)\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from How to deliver constructive feedback in difficult situations\nOther methods\n\nSBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) Useful for giving better feedback by removing emotions from it and making it clear and concise\n  Steps\n      Situation - Start the feedback with a specific situation that occurred which serves as a common reference point and is specific.\n\n      Behavior - Refer to a specific behavior that you observed and want to talk about. Make sure to not give any judgments and leave the interpretation out of it.\n\n      Impact - Talk about the impact that behavior had and what you think and feel about it. Feel free to address what other people think and how it impacted things.\n\n      Intent - Ask about the person’s intention and try to uncover if the person is aware of what he did and why he did it. Then, work together with the person to see how things can be made better and how to overcome issues.\n\n\nAt the core of NVC is a straightforward communication pattern:\n\n“When ____[observation], I feel ____[emotion] because I’m needing some ____[universal needs]. Would you be able to ____[request]?”\nExamples\n\nTo a co-founder: “When you said, ‘I’m not happy with your work,’ to me in front of the team, I felt embarrassed because it didn’t meet my need for trust and recognition. Please, could we set up a weekly one-on-one session to share feedback in private?”\nTo an investor: “I haven’t received any responses from the last three monthly updates. I’m feeling concerned because I need input. Please, would you mind getting back to me with responses to my questions in the last update?”\nTo a teammate: “You arrived 10 minutes late to the last three team meetings. I am frustrated because, as a team, we have a need for efficiency. Please, could you help me understand what’s happening?”\n\n\nObservations (vs evaluations)\n\nExamples\n\nEvaluation: “You are lazy” (which is a character attack). Observation: “You said that you’d send the document last week, and I haven’t received it.”\nEvaluation: “Your work is sloppy” (which is a criticism). Observation: “Three of the numbers in the report were inaccurate.”\nEvaluation: “You’re always late,” (which is a generalization). Observation: “You arrived 10 minutes late to the meeting this morning.”\nEvaluation: “You ignored me.” (which implies intent). Observation: “I sent you two emails, and I haven’t received a response.”\n\nCheck\n\nask yourself, “What did I actually see or hear?”\n\n\nEmotions (vs thoughts, vs evaluations)\n\nUsing an evaluation or thought instead of an emotion, can result in a defensive reply\nExamples\n\nEmotion: “I feel frustrated.” Thought: “I feel that you aren’t taking this seriously.”\nEvaluation: “I feel judged.” Impact: “I feel resentful.”\n\ndefensive reply: “I didn’t judge you.”\n\nEvaluation: “I feel misunderstood.” Impact: “I feel frustrated.”\nEvaluation: “I feel rejected.” Impact: “I feel hurt.”\n\nCheck\n\nFor thoughs, if you can substitute “I feel” with “I think” and the phrase still works — because it’s a thought, not an emotion.\n\n\nUniversal Need (vs strategy for obtaining a need)\n\nExamples\n\nStrategy: “I need you to copy me into every email.” Universal Need: “I need some transparency.”\nUniversal: ““I need support.” NOT Universal: “I need support from you.”\n\nNOT Universal is more easily interpreted as a veiled accusation and implication that “You aren’t supporting me.”\n\n\n\nRequests (vs demands)\n\nrequests are invitations for another person to meet our needs — but only if it doesn’t conflict with one of their needs.\nCharacteristics of a good request\n\nMake them specific\n\n“I request that you arrive to meetings on time.” instead of “I request that you be more respectful of everyone’s time.”\n\nSay what you want, not what you don’t want\n\nDon’t want: “I request that you don’t dismiss other people’s ideas straightaway”\nWant: “I request that when a team member shares an idea, you ask two or three probing questions before sharing your conclusion.”\n\nStay curious\n\nBe optimistic that everyone’s needs can be met.\nTreat “no” to a request or a defensive reply as an invitation to explore the needs stopping someone from saying “yes.”\nThink about how the other person is feeling and consider what unmet needs may be stopping them from saying “yes.”\n\nAre you feeling hurt because you need some understanding?\nAre you feeling angry because you need your hard work to be recognized?\nIs there more you’d like to say?\n\nSimilarly, if you’re on the receiving end of a request and have to say “no,” state the underlying need that stops you from saying “yes.”\n\n\n\nDiplomatically confirm communication if needed\n\n“Just so we know we’re on the same page, could you play back what I’m asking of you?”\n\n40-word rule\n\nDuring difficult conversations, it’s important to be extremely concise. Aim to describe your observations, feelings, needs, and requests in fewer than 40 words. Using more words suggests you’re justifying your needs, and that decreases their power.\n\nFace-to-Face is better\n\nNVC loses some of its power when it’s in an email.\n\nConsequences should be protective, not punitive\n\nAs a manager, you are responsible for the effectiveness of your team — and every team needs effectiveness. If deadlines continue to be missed (the boundary), you might have to switch their responsibilities or move them on (the consequence). It’s not personal, it’s just what you’ll do to protect your need for effectiveness.\n\n\nWays to promote projects completed by your team\n\nAnnouncement emails\n\nUnlike “sharing” emails (brief description, link), announcement emails have more pomp associated with them\nCharacteristics\n\nUse catchy subject lines — e.g. ‘Retention Dashboard is here!’ or ‘Introducing Retention Dashboard’\nIn addition to stating what the dashboard contains, tie it to key insights, recommendations and next steps\nUse icons & visuals — Adding relevant icons and visuals makes the email easier to consume and provides a nice break from all the heavy text. Caution: Do not overuse!\n\nExample\n\nReadouts\n\nAn analysis that is packaged in a way that is easy to read through\nTypically a one-time analysis\n\n(deep dive) e.g. what drives customer retention\n(root cause analysis) e.g. why did top of funnel conversion decline or analyzing an experiment / launch / campaign performance\n\nAlso reoccurring\n\nCould be weekly or monthy, depending on topics important to your stakeholders\nActively sharing summarized findings from dashboards to the stakeholders can change perception that these dashboards are just another source of data\n\nMonthly or Quarterly Business Reviews\n\nPresentations where you review health of business based on trends in key metrics (month over month, quarter over quarter)\n\nAutomate frequent requests from Marketing managers, Product managers, and Operations managers\n\nProduce a readout that covers insights from multiple dashboards that managers are frequently asking about.\n\n\nNewletter\n\nHighlight goals for ongoing work-streams and outcomes for those completed, always connecting to business outcomes or stakeholder needs\nSample Layout\n\nSummary — Key Wins & What’s Coming\nDetailed updates by themes\nNewsletter FAQ’s —\n\nGoals: What is the goal of this newsletter. e.g. Providing visibility and aligning on prioritization\nCadence: Weekly / Bi-weekly / Monthly\nAudience: Sr. Leadership of company\nTeam members\nPOC: Who should they reach out to if they have questions\n\n\nExample"

Most of the questions began with “What” and “Why”, some others were “How to” and “What if”.\nThe Answering group: CDO, CCO, BI Team, they gave answers for roughly 30% of asked questions, most of them answered for the group of “What” and “Why” questions, while the group of “How to” and “What if” went to the void.\n\nInefficient: Hypothesis-Test-Report loop (trial and error approach)\n\nthe Business Team or Financial Team kept asking about the reason why this problem happened. Then they also put you in some specific circumstances such as “what if we do this?” or ”I think this happened because of that”.\nThe loop\n\nThey give you a potential cause\nYou look at your data, did something you called analysis\nReport findings\nIf the data doesn’t support the hypothesis, they give another hypothesis, and the loop repeats\n\n\nRecommended: Run a preliminary analysis instead\n\nThe business-side won’t wait too long to get the decision from the Data Team, they just need something that sounds reasonable enough to make a decision. So, there’s a time constraint.\nRun a decision tree or other quick running algorithm on a sample of the data (if the data is “big”)\nLook at the top 1 or 2 levels of decision rules (decision tree) or feature importance (rf) or characteristics of the clusters(k-means, etc.) for a latent variable\nInterpret and report results\nThe business-side can further develop a list of hypotheses (and test) from results\n\nSolutions:\n\n3 decision rules were found to be informative and actionabel\n\nCustomers that have had 12 successful deliveries tended to continue to have successful deliveries\nCustomers who paid with a credit card tended to have successful deliveries\nCustomers who paid with a credit card and ordered over a certain $ amount tended to have successful deliveries\n\nFor the “Number of orders in the past” problem, we can collaborate with the Customer Service Team to give more support to new users, keep tracking their orders and have proper action like picking up the phone and confirming their orders when they placed any high value order. Or we can give them more instructions on how to place orders, how to contact us when they need help, and how to cancel any order when they lose their interest.\nFor the “Payment method” problem, we had a campaign in which we reserved VND30,000 (equivalent to USD1.2) and split it into 3 vouchers (VND10,000 for each). When they placed the order and chose Cost on Delivery method, we offered them a voucher (VND10,000) to reduce shipping fee if they agreed to change to another prepaid method. Of course, we offered to “remember my payment method” for them to use it later (actually that’s the way we drive them to use that method again in future), and keep doing it 3 times. Most of the cases, we succeeded in keeping them using the prepaid method after the 3rd order, and they keep using it forever after. After that, in the second campaign, we applied the first 3 free shipping fees to get more effectiveness.\nFor the “Cost of booking” problem, we used the same method with the “Number of orders in the past” problem, letting the Call Center keep interacting with Buyers who have high-value purchasing."

    "text": "47.6 Requests\n\nMisc\n\nAlso see Job, Organizational and Team Development &gt;&gt; Starting a Data Science Department &gt;&gt; Create an environment &gt;&gt; Limit ad-hoc requests\nAd-Hoc Requests Queue\n\nLimited to something an individual data practitioner can handle in no more than 1–2 weeks.\nSometimes appropriate to develop a prototype as part of an ad-hoc request, and if the stakeholder is happy with the results it de-risks a larger effort to put something into production\n\nProject-Level Work\n\nNeeds cross-functional support from multiple teams (say, putting some model into production) and requires more formal planning.\n\nTriage process\n\nSince the queue is for unplanned work and balanced against all the other incoming requests (plus ongoing, committed project priorities), avoid using it for extremely urgent requests\nA small core team reviews new requests and pending status about once weekly, and a typical request can take anywhere from 1–2 weeks to complete once it’s been reviewed and resourced.\n\nAnything more urgent is left to teams with dedicated on-call staff or more appropriate processes.\n\n\nMake results discoverable for other stakeholders and not just internally for the data team\n\nWhen possible, migrate results to a user-friendly, searchable platform to increase discoverability and provide a better-defined surface for those one-off work products “in production.”\n\nBatch and Time-box\n\nBatch: group some similar tasks (or in this case, ad-hoc requests) to be completed at once, reducing the time and effort on context-switching (i.e analyzing different tables) or moving between tools.\nTime-Box: preplan your schedule, allocate a fixed period to do projects, and only do ad-hoc requests if it’s an emergency (p0)\n\n\nTypes\n\nThe GPS: “I need this info, but I’m asking you because I do not know where to start looking.”\n\nUsually are relatively simple requests that require just applying a filter on the right place or transforming a table into a chart\nSolution (if it’s a Iikely recurrent request)\n\nSet up a time to show them how to do it themselves\nShow them step-by-step where the data is, how to filter it, and convert into a format they’re comfortable using (e.g. Excel pivot table)\nEmail them the steps\nWhen they come back with the same request, open the email, and follow the steps to show with them that following the email solves their need\nWhen they come back yet again with the same request, forward them the email or refer to the email\n\n\nThe Personal Assistant: “I need this info and I could get it myself, but I cannot / don’t want to use my time.”\n\nIf a peer asking\n\nHelp them as long as it doesn’t mean that by doing so you are not postponing tasks and requests that are within your job description and that may affect the way your work is perceived.\n\nIf it is a senior stakeholder in a meeting wanting a quick answer\n\nIf it’s something that’s not readily available (e.g. screenshot off a dashboard), give an estimation and emphasize that its an estimate\nMake sure to specify the source of the data and filters or conditions applied. This is important in case someone challenges or wants to validate it and will also help us in case it comes up in a conversation after the meeting.\nIf this happens often, ask the stakeholder to inform you in advance of when this type of meetings are going to happen, so you can be prepared.\n\n\nThe Gatherer: “This information is scattered across multiple sources or not properly structured for the need. I need you to do it.”\n\nCommon request when the reporting tools are not properly fitted to the user’s needs\nIf the tool is from outside the company:\n\nAsk reason for the request and what are they going to do with the answer. That will define the scale of what you need to build.\nIf the same request happens frequently, then you should contact the relevant team to make sure that the business has all the tools they need for their day to day operations.\n\nIf the tool is from inside the company:\n\nAsk if it is a one-of request or if it is a signal of a business need not covered by the reporting tool. And if so, add an update of it to your to-do list.\n\nExample: email format of a response to such a request\n\nAn excel with the requested data / report\nA copy-paste of the requested table / chart so they can see it on the email\nA couple of call outs from the data just to highlight what I’ve identified (no idea what a call-out is)\nA “Process” section at the bottom of the email explaining the sources, filters, queries…\n\nHelpful in case you need to reproduce the report in the future\n\n\n\nThe HAL: “I need you to run a diagnostic analysis to check why this is happening / I need to know what we need to do to fix this / …”\n\nType of question you want. Request refers to a business need.\nSteps\n\nIdentify the “why” of the request. Sometimes the question is crystal clear. Others it can be veiled or masked.\nResponse should answer 3 questions: “What, So What, Now What”\n\nWhat: make sure the type of viz or table is clear in communicating the answer\nSo What: annotate the chart and include a description of all key insights\nNow What: State your recommendations\n\nAlways deliver by email and include a tweet-like analysis summary. Even if you present it in a meeting or by sending a link (or a file) via chat, always send an email with the analysis conclusions and a brief headline of the outcome.\\\nInclude a methodology slide or part in your answer. As with previous requests, on many occasions your answer will be challenged (someone will want to understand how you got to this conclusion), or you (or someone else) will have to repeat the exercise in the future. Including a methodology (even if it is very high level) will help in repeating it. And since it is included on the email where it is sent, it will be referred to, together with the results.\n\n\nThe Workaround: “I can request it to someone else, but it will take longer and/or generate a less comprehensive / insightful output than yours. So I’m asking you.”\n\nOn many occasions, it will involve more office politics than actual analyst work\nIt can be requested to you either because the stakeholder does not know that this is not your main job or because the stakeholder trusts you more than the (tool, task, project) owner.\n\n** Always make sure that the stakeholder is aware that it should be done by X (team or person). **\nWhen it is by lack of knowledge of the task owner, try to mediate between them and the requester.\nWhen it is because of trust, then I just state the point (when delivering the answer) to make clear that this is someone else’s job.\n\nIf these requests become frequent\n\nContact the tool owner and explain that there is a mismatch between the business and the tools offered, as with the “Gatherer” requests.\nThen present what you have been delivering as a proof-of-concept to evaluate and implement in the solution.\n\n\n\nHandling Ad-Hoc Requests\n\nMisc\n\nMe: this list of inquiries is great, but it will take time for the requester to think through and give answers for this stuff. Some people just want an answer to their question and not to have to go through this type of interrogation. So maybe there can be a request form that covers this stuff. That way they know what’s expected upon making a request. Then, any further clarification can be handled through email or a quick phone call when the requester has the time.\n\nDon’t ask for metrics\n\nSince most business requestors don’t have an intimate understanding of all the assets in our analytics platform, the answers were often confusing (what logs are they referring to?) or impossible (we just don’t capture that type of data).\n\nDon’t let the stakeholder to just request a solution\n\nBy making sure that you understand the problem, you confirm that there is indeed a problem and you guarantee that your stakeholder has defined the business case.\nMake sure that you fully understand the request and that the requester fully understands what they really want.\n\nAsk them how they will use the output, or what decision will be made with the answer\n\nHelps to further contextualize the requests, and get at the heart of “why” someone is asking for help and the root of a stakeholder’s need\nProvides pivotal information for prioritization. Can infer the urgency and relative priority of a request from how the information is going to be used\n\nDon’t ask for a deadline\n\nDeadlines can result in a lot of things due yesterday and mismanaged expectations\nStakeholders tend to pick what they think is “reasonable,” but without any of the context to make that call (like other priorities in the queue, ongoing projects, complexities of the data, etc.) the timeline is arbitrary.\nFollow-up with the requester with your proposed delivery date after triage of new requests is completed. This allows your teams to manage expectations without wrecking sprints with constantly shifting priorities\n\nAsk them what happens if they don’t get the answer (on time)\n\nMe: I’m not sure about this one. Maybe require some tact. Perhaps word it differently. The requester may think they’ll never get an answer if they say anything but a catastrophe will happen if they don’t get their solution on time.\nSimilar to asking what is going to be done with the output, this helps to contextualize the need and drive prioritization. This is an even stronger tool for triaging and prioritizing requests. If someone can’t be bothered to justify what will happen without the analysis, they probably don’t need it right now.\n\nInvestigate and determine if any existing solutions may help to answer the questions that are being raised\n\nYou’ll likely have to maintain a solution indefinitely, so make sure a solution doesn’t already exist before building something new.\n\nWhen appropriate, go the extra mile to provide more than the initial ask and with minimalism/interpretability in mind\nCatalog all analysis results internally\n\nSo you can re-share, recycle, or refresh results as needed.\nIf the stakeholder has follow-up questions at a later date, whoever is picking up the request has an existing body of work to carry forward or a point-of-contact with domain expertise who worked with similar data assets.\n\nCollect feedback for each individual request\n\nGives stakeholders a chance to comment on the work products and create more opportunities for process improvement\nHelps you understand the real impact of work products that make it into “production”\n\n\nProject-Level\n\nDepending on the complexity, these requests may or may not be appropriate for the ad-hoc requests queue (gray area type projects)\nMost of the Ad-Hoc stuff above + this stuff\nMake sure that you know the proposed solution well enough to be able to explain the requirements thoroughly before reaching out to the data engineers.\nGive a sketch of the solution to the stakeholder for them to sign off on.\n\nIt should explain what the end product will look like and how it will be used\nIf this “sign-off” involves multiple people who are perhaps difficult to reach or this process of confirmation is just dragging along, strongly consider starting work on the engagement while waiting for this feedback.\nExamples\n\nDashboard: Make a quick sketch of the various stats, KPIs, filters, graphs, etc. with a general layout.\nAnalysis: Make a rough outline of the required data, the possible user inputs, as well as the various outputs (eg. charts, tables) and their formats (eg. PNG, HTML, CSV).\n\n\nDocument progress on the project\n\nEnsures that timelines are clearly communicated, negotiated, and agreed upon by the various groups involved in the project’s delivery.\nHelps to hold all teams accountable for timelines as well as allot resources to ensure that your organization is distributing resources efficiently.\n\nEngage stackeholders\n\nInform them of the engagement’s progress, and ideally show them a draft of the solution as a work in progress.\nAllows for additional feedback and potential pivots that are better surfaced partway through the project than upon its delivery.\n\nCreate documentation for the final deliverable\n\nFeatures\n\nHelps users navigate your solution\nInclude details on the data (eg. where it comes from, how it’s transformed, etc.)\n\n\nWork with the users of your solution\n\nHelp them understand how it works, inform them of any nuances they need to be aware of, and invite any questions or concerns they may have about it\n\nFollow up at a later date\n\nSee how their use of the tools are going, what pain points they’re experiencing, potential areas for improvement, etc. and then work to fix any issues\nIterate upon deliverables to achieve continuous improvement and growth of insights"

If the analytics engineer is doing their job, the analyst should have to be:\n\nwriting complex, long-running queries directly within a business intelligence platform\nreformatting the same data columns over and over again in different dashboards\nrepeating the same business logic in multiple reports or dashboards\njoining related tables that should already be joined together in one dataset\n\n\nLater hires: base these hires on current level of projects and objectives\n\nExploratory: The company has some data, but you don’t know how to capitalize on it because you don’t know where to find it or whether you should trust it.\nAnalytics: Your leadership is convinced that becoming data-driven is key to making better business decisions. There might already be some attempts to do analytics in Microsoft Excel or other tools, but you want to take data usage to the next level.\nInnovation: When you already have the necessary insights for making decisions, you think AI/ML will help you create your next differentiating edge; therefore, you want to start investing in that direction.\n\n\n\n\nData Team Placement\n\nPush for centralization in the reporting structure, but keeping the work management decentralized.\n\n\nYou want analysts or data scientists embedded in departments to report to you, but to have ad-hoc requests by departments to go through them or members of the main data team.\n\nAvoids bottlenecks where any important but simple analyses don’t have to go through you.\nAlso, strong data people want to report into a manager who understands data, not into a business person\nExample: assignments\n\ndata infrastructure, onboarding product team, supply chain team, checkout team, marketing team, support for the CEO and helping with investor/board decks\n\n\nSend out an email to a large group of people outlining this change, and make it very clear who people should work with for their data needs.\nAs you hire people going forward, you are planning to assign them to different teams throughout the company.\n\nMostly product/engineering teams, but in some cases other teams.\n\n\nWithin Engineering: in some organizations like LinkedIn, the data team is part of engineering. Having seen a similar setup play out in the past, I think that Data and Engineering teams should work as partners and, therefore, with separate reporting lines. Creating a reporting dynamic between the two might jeopardize the efficiency of the collaboration and distance the Data team from the business.\nWithin product: this makes sense when the product is tightly related to data and when the organization relies on data primarily for feature testing and other product analytics use cases.\nWithin a business entity: finance or marketing, e.g., This is usually the case for small data teams where the scope and objectives only pertain to this particular team (not recommended for larger companies).\nAs an Independent Entity: reporting directly to the CEO or CFO. This makes sense for an organization that has: a. reached a good level of data maturity and company-wide data literacy, and b. a wide variety of well-defined use cases across different business functions, and is considering a “Data as a Product” type of approach catering to various business domains.\n\n\n\nDevelop Relationships\n\nDevelop a strong relationship with those who are interested in analytics first. They will be invaluable as your advocates to excutive stakeholders and other more skeptical colleagues.\nDevelop a strong relationship with IT so you get some of the technical obstacles removed quickly.\n\nOpening ports, getting permissions\nRemote access to one of their servers so you can run resource-intensive analytics processes\n\n\n\n\nCreate Developement, Staging, and Production Environments\n\nDevelopment\n\nReproducibility\n\nEnables you to tranfer lockfiles or something similar to colleagues for collaboration\nResources\n\nBuilding Reproducible Pipelines in R\n\nPackages, Libraries\n\n{renv} - See Renv\n{{poetry}},{{pip-compile-multi}}, etc. - Python, General &gt;&gt; Environments, Python, General &gt;&gt; Dependencies\nNix\n\n\nDevelop internal packages\n\nAlso see Package Development\nDeveloping packages for your company’s specific use cases increases efficiency\nSee Building a team of internal R packages | Emily Riederer and VIDEO How to make internal R packages part of your team - RStudio\nFunctions that get/process data commonly used in most projects\nWrapper functions for connecting to separate databases (See Databases, Relational &gt;&gt; Misc &gt;&gt; Wrapper for db connections)\ncon_depA &lt;- localDB::connect_databaseA(username = ..., password = ...)\ncon_depB &lt;- localDB::connect_databaseB(username = ..., password = ...)\ncon_Lex &lt;- localDB::connect_databaseLex(username = ..., password = ...)\n\n\nSecurity\n\nNeed a secure way to download packages (e.g. remember log4j vulnerability)\nPosit Package Manager - repository management server that allows you download packages while being disconnected from the internet\n\nPosit Public Package Manager - a free service that provides complete mirrors of CRAN, Bioconductor, and PyPI, including historic package snapshots. It is based on Posit Package Manager, the professional product for teams who need greater control over how they expose R, Python, and Bioconductor packages within their organizations.\n\nAlso {RDepot} for management might be an option\n\nStaging\n\nStaging environment should be as close as possible the production environment\n\nDeployment\n\nAuthentification system - system where a user or user group with permissions is allowed to access your application using a username and password\nScheduling system - scripts running on a schedule\nMonitoring - alerts you to any errors in the pipeline\n\n\n\n\nEarly Projects\n\nSmall companies have limited budgets, so demonstrating frugality and resourcefulness in your early projects may assist you in obtaining more resources in the future\nSet up a meeting with the CEO later that week.\n\nYour goal is to figure out a few metrics she wants reported on weekly in an automatic email.\n\nSet up weekly 1:1s with a number of key people across the org that need data.\n\nYour goal is to find data gaps and opportunities and dispatch them to the data scientists.\n\nIf data is decentralized, create a data warehouse that houses all data\n\n\nFind analysts or other people in departments that have experience with SQL or are interested in learning it.\n\nAfter the data has been centralized, they will then be able to answer some of the ad-hoc data questions for the managers of those departments\nThese people may go too far at times but giving them access to the data will be a net positive.\n\n\nCreate presentations for departments that aren’t data driven\n\nExample:\n\nSituation:\n\nData team projects for product aren’t being put into production.\n\n“Product managers put it on the backlog, but they keep pushing it off because other things keep coming up.”\n\nProduct puts features into production without A/B testing, because they’re being “bold” and don’t want to wait for experiments that last months\n\nNo idea if the results of their features are significant or not.\n\n\nProduct managers are not thinking about data as a tool for building better features\nThere is a lack of alignment between what product teams want to build versus what data teams have\n\nPresention: Showcase many examples of tests with unexpected outcomes from your previous experience, and you make parts of the presentation a bit interactive where the audience has to guess whether test or control won.\n\nFind analyses or queries that are computationally expensive\n\nBuild pipelines to produce “derived” datasets. Once these datasets are built, costs of performing the analyses will be much lower\n\nSounds like a job for dbt.\n\n\nWork with every department team and make sure they have their own dashboard with the top set of metrics they care about.\n\n\n“white-glove analytics” means give special attention (prioritize) to analytics for excecs and CEO.\n\nProduce something quick initially (establishes respect for your expertise)\n\nGet a list of the most pressing problems that the executives wanted me to solve.\nFind a relatively small but high-impact problem.  (see Project, Planning)\nNail it and make sure that it is recognized as solving a high-priority problem.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Culture\n\nLimit ad-hoc requests\n\ne.g. creating one-time reports and pulling data\nSee Job, On the Job &gt;&gt; Requests\nMake it clear that automating your pipeline, cleaning up your dashboards, and streamlining your data definitions will have a massive impact in the future\nCreate or purchase a ticketing system to manage all incoming requests from other departments in a company (article)\n\nThis will help in managing the workload, and prevent the pressure of stakeholders sending direct emails or ping-ing team members on the requests.\nIt needs to manage the lifecycle of every individual request, from submission to resolution\nPrioritizes the most important problems and creates a sense of urgency for the team to focus and solve.\nForm should include:\n\nRequestor’s team\nDetails of the request: what are the data needed? In which format (i.e spreadsheet, dashboard, analytics documents, database table, etc)? What/how the data will be used for?\nPriority/time when the data is needed\n\n\nEducate Stakeholders if they’re eager to learn\n\nVideo on navigating the repository (?)\nSimple utilization of the dashboards\n\nutilizing the filters and interactive parameters to get the data their needs.\n\nMore advanced education can be a workshop on data sources and SQL/querying courses, but this is not mandatory.\n\n\nWrite clear documentation of all processes and standards\n\nWithout documentation of team practices, losing team members means losing domain knowledge\nWith documentation comes team reviews of this documentation. Through reviews, everyone learns something new. The rest of your team will be introduced to new concepts and ideas that will only make your team stronger\nData documentation\n\nKnowledge graphs are a paradigm often leveraged by SaaS data solutions that automatically represents data as nodes in a graph, drawing connections via logic and metadata. Knowledge graph-based tools, like lineage, are often automated to help data teams save time and resources when it comes to generating quick documentation about the relationships between and about data across the organization.\nFormalizing service-level agreements (SLAs) and service-level indicators (SLIs), and putting together implicit and explicit contracts between teams can help everyone stay aligned on priorities as you work to meet your goals.\n\n**See Developing a Data Platform &gt;&gt; Data Observability &gt;&gt; Data Reliability\n\n\n\nStart having code reviews\n\nMake code reviews a common practice by enforcing them through Github\nBest way everyone can optimize their code\nTidyteam code review principles\n\nKnowledge-sharing presentations\n\n“lunch and learn”\nAll about building one another up and using each other as learning opportunities\nGet rid of the pressure of having to do everything in a certain domain\nIf one person’s area becomes flooded with tasks, having others with those same skills came lessen the load on one person\nIf a person gets sick or leaves, another team member can pick up the slack"

A recent report from ThoughtSpot and the Harvard Business Review found that successful companies are enabling frontline workers, like customer service representatives and delivery and repair workers, with better data and insights to make good decisions. When workers have that information, the report found, companies have higher rates of customer and employee satisfaction and higher productivity and top-line growth.\nLong process but measureable results can be had within a year\nData Literacy is not the final goal. Others:\n\nData Maturity — easy access throughout the organization to good data\n\nAlso see Data Maturity\n\nData-Driven Leadership — Meaning that leaders demonstrate the skills they require of workers\n\nAlso see Developing a Data Driven Organization\n\nData-Driven Decision-Making\n\nAlso see Developing a Data Driven Organization\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels\n\nFrom Data Literacy Personas\nData Skeptics : They don’t believe in the value and power of analytics. They see analytics and data as a ‘burden’ to their work. They can derail any Data Literacy project unless carefully nurtured into becoming Data Enthusiasts. A good data awareness program is imperative in turning these skeptics into enthusiasts.\nData Enthusiasts : They believe in the power of data. They are eager to learn more about how to use data and interpret it in their work. A good Data Literacy program could usher them and the company to new heights toward being data-driven.\nData Literates : They understand the analytics landscape and can be an active participant in discussions involving data. They are willing to hone up their analytics skills. A good recipe-based analytics program with hands-on practice on the most employed analytics techniques can take them and the company a long way toward being data-driven.\nCitizen Analysts: They are data-driven employees who can solve 80% of their business problems using a structured approach to analytics and, in the process, align the stakeholders as well. They can get to an actionable solution and move the critical metrics for the company. Some Citizen Analysts can also be taught advanced analytics.\nData Scientists: They are well versed in advanced analytics methodologies. They can solve almost 100% of business problems using analytics. They are adept in using cutting-edge tools like R, Python, and SAS to manipulate data and build models. These Data Scientists are capable of aligning stakeholders toward an actionable solution and excelling at the data-driven decision-making process.\nData-Driven Executives: They understand the power of analytics, which is the discovery and interpretation of meaningful patterns in data and their application for effective decision making. Data plays an integral role in the decision-making process. They hold their team accountable for their work and can understand when analytics has been executed in the right manner or not.\n\n\n\nCreate a Data Literacy Plan\n\nNotes from How to Build Data Literacy at Your Company\nDefine data literacy goals, assessing employees’ current skill levels, and laying out appropriate learning paths\nSteps:\n\nDistinguish between data literacy and technical literacy\n\nBeing able to use a tool and understanding how derive insights from it are two different things\nLiteracy ( https://dam-prod.media.mit.edu/x/2016/10/20/Edu_D’Ignazio_52.pdf )\n\nRead with data, which means understanding what data is and the aspects of the world it represents.\nWork with data, including creating, acquiring, cleaning, and managing it.\nAnalyze data, which involves filtering, sorting, aggregating, comparing, and performing other analytic operations on it.\nArgue with data, which means using data to support a larger narrative that is intended to communicate some message or story to a particular audience.\n\n\nStart with a baseline of employee skills\n\nAfter knowing a baseline, you can develop a plan to upskill employees\nExample survey: https://aryng.com/data-literacy-test\n\nIt’s not that good, but it gives an idea of how it should be formulated\n{shinysurvey} could be used to develop something suitable for a company’s particular business model\n\nScore and categorize using something like the “levels” (above)\n\nUse common language\n\nUsing jargon or imprecise terms can create confusion and complicate communication about data.\nLanguage = Culture\n\nBuild a culture of learning and reward curiosity\n\nLeaders should make sure to foster an environment that rewards curiosity instead of punishing lack of data literacy.\nIf there is a culture of fear rather than of continuous learning and improvement, then people would feel ashamed that they’re not data-literate.\nDon’t punish people for negative data. Confront the brutal facts of the negative data and learn from it. If punishment is the first reaction, then people will try to hide the data or manipulate it – vanity metrics.\n\nTake into account different learning styles\n\nNot everyone is suited to a three-hour training classes — some employees learn best with hands-on exercises, while others might like self-led courses\n\nTrack progress and develop metrics\n\nNo real examples of metrics.\n\nLeadership must be involved\n\nChief Data Officers are often the ones in charge of literacy initiatives, but all top executives needs to be on board and modeling the desired results.\nExecutives should be part of the program"

Granular aspects of the business.\n\nData teams focus on measuring these.

He or she can take in feedback and collect change requests to ensure it is and stays fit-for-purpose.\nConceptual & Logical Models - There is a skilled person with core data modeling expertise and the ability to project it onto a real-life business domain to describe it in logical attributes that make sense to the business and technology organization alike.\nPhysical Models- Should have people who can design and implement the schemas\n\nProcesses — The processes and workflows, including the documentation of data modeling methodologies, the development of data modeling templates and standards, and the establishment of quality control and review processes.\n\nMetamodel - There should be description of how the metamodel is to be used in modeling activities which makes work easier as data people have a clear basis to start from.\nConceptual & Logical Models - The process of creating these models should have an owner and there should be a structured process to create new logical attributes, and to then have them reviewed, approved, and published.\nPhysical Models - A data dictionary can also be used to define and standardize the technical details such as data types, constraints, and other database objects.\n\nTechnology — The tools required to support data modeling efforts such data modeling software and tools, and the integration of data modeling tools with other systems and applications.\n\nConceptual & Logical Models - There should tools that can provide a visual representation of the models and can support collaboration, version control, and integration with other systems such as a data catalogue or metadata management system. A business glossary can be used to define and standardize the business concepts and terms that are used in the models.\nPhysical Models - Should have appropriate technology tools to support schema design and implementation. Database design software can be used to create and maintain physical data models. These tools can generate database schemas from the logical data model and can support collaboration, version control, and integration with other systems such as a data catalogue or metadata management system.\n\nAdoption — The adoption and usage of data modeling practices within and across the organization. This may include socialization programs, the resolution of barriers to adoption, and the tracking metrics to measure the effectiveness and impact of data modeling efforts.\n\n\n\nTips and Best Practices\n\nGet the metamodel right first. The metamodel drives reusability and consistency across the entire enterprise. It makes sure that all subsequent modeling efforts incrementally build out the overall model. If you don’t have one in place, you’re up for a gargantuan task of aligning and bridging existing, incompatible models in the future.\nConsider prebaked industry or universal models. Depending on where you are in your journey, you can consider adopting a preexisting data model. This can drive alignment with international best practices and standards, save you time and effort to build a model entirely from scratch, and enable efficient and reliable data exchanges with external parties. For example, BIAN provides a standardized banking services reference model that defines a common language, taxonomy, and business process framework for the banking industry.\nIterate between conceptual, logical, and physical. Data modeling takes time — the job will never be done. It is recommended to prioritize domains — reference domains like Customers and Products are good candidates—and start with 1 or 2, where you first complete the logical model and then guidelines for the physical model, before you move on to the next domain.\nDon’t overdo the physical. Data modeling can be complex, time-consuming, and therefore expensive. Completing a basic conceptual and logical model is almost always definitely worth the effort, but once venturing into the physical domain, you may not need to centrally direct and capture all of the physical models. You may want to prioritize here as well — for example, identify “mission critical” systems and document physical models for those, but for other ones, it may be sufficient to ensure that local application owners abide by specific modeling norms and standards.\nStrategically implement technology. They can be expensive, and you might not need them for the first domain, but eventually your data models will grow exponentially in terms of their size and complexity. Consider a data catalogue, business glossary, and data dictionary, or something that can serve as all of these. Without it, consumption (and hence value creation) will be poor."

    "text": "Developing a Data Strategy\n\nMisc\n\nThere is no one path to developing a data strategy since every situation is unique\n\nRather than looking at what other companies have done, the key is examining your own needs and prioritizing the best data investments for your company\n\nPlanning\n\nPlanning forces a discussion about prioritization that can lead to key realizations about hiring and resourcing.\nSet three OKRs every quarter that will truly move the needle that align with your company’s bottom line\nKeep your primary goal at the forefront and stay flexible by revisiting your plan often\nWorkflow Example: B2C (business-to-consumer) model\n\n\n\n\n\nObjectives and Key Results (OKRs)\n\nAlso see\n\nThread\nProduct Development &gt;&gt; Metrics\nKPIs\n\nOKRs are a framework for turning strategic intent into measurable outcomes for an organization.\n\nObjectives are written as a set of goals that the company or department wants to achieve over a given time horizon, usually a year. Key Results are quantitative measures that might indicate you’ve reached that Objective.\nExample: a CEO will set goals for acquiring customers and the Chief Marketing Officer in turn will develop the objectives of marketing campaign reach and customer acquisitions that are expressed as the Key Results (outcomes) that will show that these goals have been achieved\nProduct outcomes measure a change in customer behavior. Product outcomes help drive business outcomes. Business outcomes measure the health of the business.\n\nExample: Education Platform\n\nBusiness Outcomes:\n\nObjective: Help more teams adopt “continuous discovery” (her business) as a way of working.\nKey result: Reduce the # of unsold seats in our courses.\nKey result: Sell more books\nKey result: Grow membership by x%\n\nProduct Outcomes:\n\nObjective: Help members invest in their “discovery habits.” (what she teaches)\nKey result: Increase % of members who interview every week.\nKey result: Increase % of members who assumption test every week\nKey result: Increase % of members who define outcomes every quarte\n\n\n\n\nAs OKRs are transparent across the company they can help plug the strategic planning gap.\n\nExample: The Data division can see what Marketing are trying to achieve and what their intended outcomes will be. The Marketing Data team can plan and see what activities they can help out with. Importantly the Marketing Data team can add in improvement objectives that might make them a better team and provide a better service.\n\nTest and verify Metrics\n\nIt’s critical to test metrics before using them in OKR, otherwise, metrics may lead to biased investments\nDeveloping the metrics and means of collection that will be used to measure progress against each OKR.\nCollect data and verify hypotheses with visualization or statistical methods.\n\nWhen different stakeholders agree upon metrics, teams can now build a dashboard to monitor how business decisions affect metrics and profits\n\nSocialize and fine tune the OKRs with the data teams that will be responsible for delivery.\nThe data teams will then determine the tasks and activities needed to make the key results happen. How this happens depends on how your company builds products and services. For example in an agile shop this will then lead to story development and sprint planning.\n\nReview OKRs regularly\n\nWhen businesses evolve, so should metrics\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\nAlignment with customer needs\n\nData team needs to provide support for the product, marketing, customer services, mobile, website engineering\nExample\n\nO: Acquire more mobile app customers\nKR: 75% uplift in mobile app downloads\nData Strategy: Align with functional teams to meet company objectives\nData OKR: all customer journeys that lead to app store purchases must have metrics collection and analytics to measure progress or drop-out.\n\n\nData Platform Technology and Architecture: A plan to build a robust platform of data storage, data feeds, visualisation and modelling tools and a supporting connective infrastructure.\nAnalytics: An ability to apply models and perform deep analysis on the data that you have.\nDemocratization of data:\n\nMaking data available where necessary, cataloguing it, making it discoverable and well understood to encourage staff in the company to make effective use of it.\n\nPeople:\n\nHiring and retaining top talent, developing the staff you already have, fostering a culture of technical excellence and collaboration.\nExample\n\nO: Commit to developing our staff to reduce attrition and skills leaking out\nKR: Staff churn is kept below 10% each quarter\nData Strategy: Keep our teams technically skilled, engaged and current\nData OKR: 75% of staff in our data teams successfully complete 3 online technical courses in a year\n\n\nCompliance/Governance: Remaining compliant with regulatory data requirements and company policies with respect to data collection and usage.

If there are cutbacks to your team, it should illicit howls from department heads and should be fighting for more data resources.\nFor automating tasks, get an estimate of how much time and how many people it takes for that task to be completed during the project’s planning stages.\n\nUsing their salaries, estimate hourly wage and calculate sum(employee_wage * time_spent_on_task)\nAfter you automate task or make it more efficient, make the same estimation and the difference will be the ROI that data science provided\n\nRecord improvements from baseline or old model to new model using cost function\nExample Metrics\n\nCost Reduction: Raw material cost reduction per unit, cost of goods sold per unit, cost of goods manufactured per unit etc.\nYield Improvement: Percentage of waste/rejection reduced\nHuman Time Saving: Reducing manual labor by 30% per day, per batch, per sprint or any other suitable metrics\nProcess Improvement: Reduce cycle time by 20 hours, reduce waiting time by 2 hours, reduced exit cycle time by 8%, and minimize the customer return processing time by 6%\nSpeed: Reduce time to market by 100 days average delivery time by 10 minutes.\nQuality: Reduction in number of customer returns by 20%, decrease in number of customer complaints by 14%, reduction in warranty calls by 10%, and decrease in number of bugs by 12%\nMarket Share: Growth in market share by 5% compared to the previous year for a given brand, geographic region, customer segment or overall consumer base\nCustomer Base: Growth in customer base by 6% year over year, increase in average time spent per user session by 10%, increase in customer conversion rate by 25%, and increase in customer retention by 12%\n\nApplying Metrics\n\nSchedule meetings with business users to walk through the potential metrics and help decide which ones apply to your project\nEstablish baselines for each metric\n\nIf historical data isn’t available, need to work with multiple business teams or users to make assumptions and approximate the raw numbers to come up with the required baseline value\n\nAfter a reasonable period (depends on context, e.g. 6 months), calculate the change between the baseline and post-treatment for each metric\n\nIf department heads aren’t willing to go to bat for your team, then examine three areas\n\nSiloed data teams\n\nOften data products are only part of the decision making process and when the data teams are separated from other departments it’s difficult to quantize their contribution.\n\nExample\n\nWhen deciding to purchase goods from a supplier, the demand forecast is obviously really important, but so does the allowed pack sizes, the minimum order quantity, the storage finite capacity, etc.\n\n\nSolutions\n\nConsider changing to an integrated schema, Models for Integrating Data Science Teams Within Organizations like the hybrid “product data science” schema\nTrack Decision Impact (DI) metrics ($), which doesn’t focus on intrinsic error (e.g. RMSE, MAE, F1, etc.), but rather on the quality of the decisions made that involved your data product.\n\nNotes from 10 Reasons to Implement the New Generation of Business Oriented Metrics\nAlso see Domain Knowledge Notebook, Logistics &gt;&gt; Decision Impact Metrics\nExample with forecasting\n\n\nOther viz of these values could include stacked bars, gauges, or areas\nTotal range that’s addressable for forecast improvement\n\nDIn-o = DIn - DIo\n\nDIn is the cost associated with the decisions made using a prior method or baseline or naive forecast\nDIo is the truth. What are the costs associated with a decision if perfect knowledge were available. Calculate one the future observed values become available\n\n\nAdded value delivered by the actual forecasting process\n\nDIn-a = DIn - DIa\n\nDIa is the cost associated with the decision made using your forecast\n\n\nThe maximum value that could still be delivered by improving the actual forecast process\n\nDIa-o = DIa - DIo\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning\n\nObjectives and key results (OKR) is a goal-setting framework for defining and tracking objectives (O) and their outcomes (KR).\n\n\nInfrastructure-level objectives — like implementing a new data warehouse — can live separately, but should still have explicit callouts for how those investments are supporting the higher-level objectives.\n\nData people should be included in other department planning meetings and stakeholders should be involved in data team meetings where projects are prioritized. Gives them more insight into data team activities.\n\ne.g. If the Marketing team has a weekly planning meeting or daily stand-ups, the Data analysts supporting that team should be in the room (or Zoom, or whatever).\n\n\nTools\n\nInteractive apps (shiny) where stakeholders can run different scenarios can integrate them more into the process\n\nI think this is fine where applicable, but not to go overboard with it. This dude (article author) also builds these types of platforms and probably was pushing his product a bit."

Who has made these changes and for what reasons?\nLineage: For a given data asset, what are the upstream sources and downstream assets which are impacted by it? Who are the people generating this data, and who is relying on it for decision-making?\nAvailability: Whether the data is available. Things like network issues or infra issues can prevent users from accessing data.\nFreshness: How up-to-date your data tables are, as well as the rhythm when your tables are updated.\n(In)Completeness:The percentage of unexpected missing data entries, can be both on the row level and column level. For example, is there any row from the upstream tables not being processed? Is there any field in the destination table missing data for &gt; X% of rows?\nDuplicates: The percentage of unexpected duplicated primary key(s).\nDistribution: The accepted range of certain fields. It can be an enumeration or a range of numbers.\nFormat: The expected format and schema of the data like CSV, or BigQuery table\nRelationship: Any test on complicated business logic which involves multiple columns or tables.\n\n\n\n\nData Reliability\n\n\nAlso see\n\nIt’s Time to Set SLA, SLO, SLI for Your Data Team — Only 3 Steps for more details on benefits\nSLOs, SLIs, SLAs, oh my—CRE life lessons\nGlossary: DS terms\n\nSLAs\n\nIt improves the communication between engineers and stakeholders by clearly defining the scope of data reliability and what “okay” and “not okay” means. Making it crystal clear avoids the needless discussion on what does and doesn’t need attention.\n\nGives engineers an error budget which is a metric to prevent engineers from burning out and it helps the team allocate their time wisely\n\nIt helps engineers decide how much time should be spent on delivering features and how much time should be spent on making the existing pipelines more reliable.\n\nSLOs\n\n\nIf data availability threshold is set to 99.9% in SLA, then it should be 99.99% in SLO.\nIf a service breaks SLO, on-call engineers need to react quickly to avoid it breaking SLA, otherwise, the company (or the team) will lose money (or reputation).\nTo achieve overall availability 99.9%, the team needs to monitor the up-time of a few internal tools and each of them has its own SLO threshold.\n\nSLIs\n\nMetrics in the monitoring system\nYour SLIs will depend on your specific use case, but here are a few metrics used to measure data trust, a common KPI:\n\nThe number of data incidents for a particular data asset (N). Although this may be beyond your control, given that you likely rely on external data sources, it’s still an important driver of data downtime and usually worth measuring.\nTime-to-detection (TTD): When an issue arises, this metric quantifies how quickly your team is alerted. If you don’t have proper detection and alerting methods in place, this could be measured in weeks or even months. “Silent errors” made by bad data can result in costly decisions, with repercussions for both your company and your customers.\nTime-to-resolution (TTR): When your team is alerted to an issue, this measures how quickly you were able to resolve it.\n\n\nSteps\n\nCreate the SLA with your stakeholders\n\nDefine what reliable data means together with your stakeholders\n\nData engineers can assess the historical performance of the data to gain a baseline and understand its usage pattern, what fields are mostly queried, and at what frequency\nWhat do stakeholders care about the most? Freshness? Accuracy? Availability? Duplicates?\n\nStart low so engineers don’t need to run 24/7 rotations and stakeholders are typically ok with a few hours of downtime initially (99% = ~1.68 hours downtime per week). As the situation gets more stable, you can increase it to the ideal number. (99.99% = few minutes downtime per month)\nExample: Critical Revenue Table on BigQuery\n\nAvailability 99.9%: Table should always be accessible.\n\nAvailability has a higher SLA because it mostly relies on BigQuery service which promises 99.99% up-time.\n\nFreshness 99%: Table should be refreshed daily before 9 am with yesterday’s revenue.\nUniqueness 99%: Table shouldn’t contain any duplication on the composite key.\nCorrectness 99%: Amount fields like gross_booking, net_booking, net_revenue should be calculated correctly.\n\n\nSelect SLIs\n\nSelect metrics that will help you meet the terms of the SLA\nThe selection of indicators is very specific to the data infrastructure the team is using\nExample: Airflow + BigQuery + dbt to deliver data\n\nAvailability: Seconds since the latest heartbeat (i.e. timestamp emitted by a job) from Airflow\n\nThe downtime of Airflow doesn’t have a direct impact on the BigQuery table’s availability, but as mentioned previously, it’s worth monitoring internal tools which contribute to the final SLA.\n\nFreshness: Hours since the table was updated last time.\nUniqueness: The test result of the uniqueness test in dbt.\nCorrectness: The test result of other value checking in dbt.\n\n\nDefine the SLO and set up alerts\n\nSet the internally acceptable range of failure per indicator.\nTo give on-call engineers enough reaction time before there’s a violation of the SLA, the SLO should be more strict than the SLA.\nCreate alerting rules and rate incidents by the level of severity.\nCan display on a dashboard, making it effective to communicate and resolve the issue\nExample: See SLO and SLI examples\n\nThe services you use will have dependencies, so you’ll need to take them into account when defining your SLOs\n\nIf the dependencies have stricter SLO than you have (i.e. what your customer needs to be happy), then there nothing more to do.\nIf some do NOT, then you need to mitigate those risks.\n\nSee article (bottom) which links blog, blog, spreadsheet tool (used to calculate risk)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Discovery\n\nNeed a reliable, scalable way to document and understand critical data assets\nFeatures\n\nSelf-service discovery and automation\n\nData teams should be able to easily leverage their data catalog without a dedicated support team.\nGreater accessibility naturally leads to increased data adoption, reducing the load for your data engineering team.\n\nScalability as data evolves\nReal-time visibility into data health\n\nUnlike a traditional data catalog, data discovery provides real-time visibility into the data’s current state, as opposed to its “cataloged” or ideal state.\nGlean insights such as which data sets are outdated and can be deprecated, whether a given data set is production-quality, or when a given table was last updated.\n\nSupport for governance and warehouse/lake optimization: From a governance perspective, querying and processing data in the lake often occurs using a variety of tools and technologies (Spark on Databricks for this, Presto on EMR for that, etc.), and as a result, there often isn’t a single, reliable source of truth for reads and writes (like a warehouse provides). A proper data discovery tool can serve as that central source of truth."

    "text": "Developing an On-Call Environment\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from How to Build an On-Call Culture in a Data Engineering Team\n\n\n\nCreate Table of Production Issues\n\n\nThe more detailed the guideline, the more streamlined the on-call process will be.\n\n\n\nCreate a Workflow\n\n\nOn-call workflow tells engineers how to approach a variety of production requests in a consistent manner.\nMore preparation means fewer decisions we have to make on the spot, leading to fewer mistakes.\nMain Steps\n\nDefine the sources of alerts. Redirect all production issues into one or two channels. For example, use Slack integration to redirect pipeline issues, infrastructure failures, and test failures into a centralized Slack channel for easy tracking.\nIdentify the category of alerts, the scale of the impact, and its urgency. Every on-call should be able to assess the urgency of the issue based on its category, impact, and SLA requirements. By creating “data products” with clear requirements, teams can benefit from the process that enables them to identify the impact and urgency efficiently. I recommend article — Writing data product pipelines with Airflow, a nice practice to write data requirements as code in Airflow dags.\nIdentify the root cause and solve the issue. When an urgent issue arises, on-call should do their best to find the root cause and solve the issue. However, not every data engineer knows all the nitty-gritty of data models maintained by data analysts. In such situations, following an escalation pattern can be helpful. It allows engineers to ask for help from other engineers or analysts with necessary expertise until the issue is resolved.\nPerform post-incident actions and update the on-call journal. Don’t forget to perform post-incident actions like backfilling to correct historical data for incremental models. It’s also recommended to keep an on-call journal for knowledge sharing.\nUser communication. In a parallel thread, it’s important to keep users in the loop. Effective communication during the “data downtime” builds trust between the data team and users. One of my articles — Status Page for Data Products — We All Need One introduces the status page as a method to improve effective communications during data downtime.\n\n\n\n\nOn-call ownership\n\nClearly, engineers are responsible for technical failures, but when it comes to data model failure, ownership becomes controversial.\nOptions\n\nAssign an owner to each data model as much as you can. Simply assigning an owner to the model tremendously improves efficiency during on-call.\nTreat data model owners as “external parties”. It’s not uncommon that software relies on an external party that is outside of engineers’ control such as an IoT service that relies on a network provider. Similarly, data engineers may need to work with model owners who are outside of their immediate team to address the model failures. When external knowledge is required, engineers should feel comfortable reaching out and proactively working with them while informing users of the progress. Do not put stress on on-call engineers by expecting them to solve issues on their own.\n\n\n\n\nOn-call rotation\n\nSchedule\n\nCan use spreadsheets to manage rotation schedules and a cron job to propagate the schedule into a calendar in near real-time. (e.g. Google Sheets + Apps Script + Google Calendar)\nPlatforms ($): Opsgenie and PagerDuty\n\nPermissions\n\nOn-Call engineers may need additional permissions at times\nOptions\n\nPerform a permission escalation, temporarily granting the engineer additional privileges.\nCreate a high-privileged user group and rotate group members.\n\nEssential to ensure that the rotation of the group members must be in sync with the on-call calendar rotation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication channels\n\nFinding the right balance between being informed and not being overwhelmed by alerts is crucial\nCentralized data alerts channel (alerts -&gt; team)\n\nBy having a dedicated channel where all alerts are sent, it becomes easier to monitor and manage alerts, reducing the risk of critical information being missed or overlooked\nSlack is a popular choice because it can easily integrate with various data sources such as Opsgenie, GCP Cloud logging, Sentry, service desk, etc.\n\nEscalation policies (team -&gt; team)\n\nA set of procedures that outlines how an organization will respond to issues that require additional resources beyond the initial response.\n\nUser communication (team -&gt; users)\n\nNeeds to start as soon as the issue is identified. Keeping the channel centralized by setting up a tool like status page.\n\n\n\n\nOn-call runbook\n\nA set of instructions that on-call can follow when responding to issues.\nMust be regularly updated to reflect the changes.\nComponents\n\nMetadata around the data product: owner, model incrementality, priority, schedule, SLA, and SLO.\nEscalation procedures (if not handled automatically).\nTroubleshooting guides: how to solve common issues. For example, perform full-refresh, check source data, logs, data observability tools and etc.\nPost-incident verification: how to verify if the issue is properly solved. For a cron job, the issue can only be verified in the next run which can be a few hours or days later.\n\n\n\n\nOn-call journal\n\n\nTool for documenting production issues\nHelps engineers who look for tested solutions and managers who search for trends.\nA templated journal ensures engineers approached each issue with the same scientific rigor.\nEach record includes intensive metadata around the issues and the in-depth investigation and what they did to fix the issue."

Additionally, it was discovered the presence of some outlier phenomena in the data which has been identified by the stakeholders as acceptable noise. Further we discovered that there is a latent grouping to the stores across sales, store type and assortment. This insight will be used to guide marketings action in the future.”\n\nAppendix\n\nSchedule of Maintenance\nFuture Research"

    "text": "48.11 Domain Specific\n\nTime Series Notes from Why Should I Trust Your Forecasts?\n\nIn Goodwin et al. (paper yet to be published, July 2021), people trusted forecasts more when they were presented as “best case” and “worst case” values rather than as “bounds of a 90% prediction interval.”\n\nWtf is “worst case”? Outside an 80% CI? If so that has a 20% chance of happening.\n\nIn some situations, managers who are not mathematically inclined may be suspicious of forecasts presented using technical terminology and obscure statistical notation (Taylor and Thomas, 1982).\n\nSuch a manager may respect the forecast provider’s quantitative skills, but simultaneously perceive that the provider has no understanding of managers’ forecasting needs – hence the manager distrusts the provider’s forecasts\n\nI don’t understand this one either. What could possibly be the different “forecasting need” that the manager needs?\n\n\nExplanations (i.e. justifications, rationale, etc.) of the forecast can improve people’s perceptions of a forecast. The higher the perceived value of the explanations, the higher the level of acceptance of the forecast. (Gönül et al, 2006)\n\nPeople enjoy the “stories” and it makes the forecasts more believable.\n\nProvide cues for how to evaluate the forecast in the report\nProvide accuracy metrics in relation to a reasonable benchmark\n\nExample: rolling average, naive, average for these days over the previous 5 yrs, whatever the current method is, etc.\nIn very unpredictable situations, this will help to show that relatively high forecast errors are unavoidable and not a result of the forecaster’s lack of competence.\n\nBeing transparent about assumptions, and even presenting multiple forecasts based on different assumptions, will most likely reassure the user about the integrity of the provider."

Post-Hoc analysis is conducted after the experiment.\n\nbias - see unbiased estimator\nceteris paribus - latin for “all things being equal” or “other things held constant.”\nclosed form - a mathematical expression that uses a finite number of standard operations. It may contain constants, variables, certain well-known operations, and functions, but usually no limit, differentiation, or integration.\nconsistency - Requires that the outcome of the procedure with unlimited data should identify the underlying truth. Usage is restricted to cases where essentially the same procedure can be applied to any number of data items. In complicated applications of statistics, there may be several ways in which the number of data items may grow. For example, records for rainfall within an area might increase in three ways: records for additional time periods; records for additional sites with a fixed area; records for extra sites obtained by extending the size of the area. In such cases, the property of consistency may be limited to one or more of the possible ways a sample size can grow\ndegrees of freedom - When discussed about variable-sample size tradeoff, usually means n-p, where is the number of rows and p is the number of variables. The more variables used in the model the fewer degrees of freedom and therefore less power and precision.\nexchangeability - means we can swap around, or reorder, variables in the sequence without changing their joint distribution.\n\nEvery IID (independent, identically distributed) sequence is exchangeable - but not the other way around. Every exchangeable sequence is identically distributed, though\n\nExample: If you draw a sequence of red and blue marbles from a bag without replacement, the sample is exchangeable but not independent. e.g. drawing a red marble affects the probability of drawing a red or blue marble next.\n\n\nefficiency - A test, estimator, etc. is more efficient than another test, estimator, etc. if it requires fewer observation to obtain the same level of performance.\nergodicity - the idea that a point of a moving system, either a dynamical system or a stochastic process, will eventually visit all parts of the space that the system moves in, in a uniform and random sense\nexternal validity - Our estimates are externally valid if inferences and conclusions can be generalized from the population and setting studied to other populations and settings. (also see internal validity)\nidentifiable (aka point-indentifiable) - theoretically possible to learn the true values of this model’s underlying parameters after obtaining an infinite number of observations from it (see non-identifiability, partially-indentifiable)\nill-conditioned - In SVD decomposition, when there’s a huge difference between largest and smallest eigenvalue of the original matrix, A, the ratio of which is called condition number.\ninternal validity - our estimates are internally valid if statistical inferences about causal effects are valid for the population being studied. (also see external validity)\nintractable - problems for which there exist no efficient algorithms to solve them. Most intractable problems have an algorithm – the same algorithm – that provides a solution, and that algorithm is the brute-force search\nlocality - effects have causes and chains of cause and effect must be unbroken in space and time (not the case in ‘entanglement’)\nnon-identifiability - the structure of the data and model do not make it possible to estimate the parameter’s value. Multicollinearity is a type of non-identifiability problem. (i.e. two or more parametrizations of the model are observationally equivalent) (see identifiable, partially-indentifiable)\noverdetermined system - In linear regression, when there are more observations than features, n &gt; p\npartial coefficient - The coefficient of a variable in a multivariable regression. In a simple regression, the coefficient of the variable is just called the “regression coefficient.”\npartially-indentifiable (aka set identifiable) - non-identifiable but possible to learn the true values of a certain subset of the model parameters\nrobust - a “robust” estimator in statistics is one that is insensitive to outliers, whereas a “robust” estimator in econometrics is insensitive to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (hyndman)\nsupport (aka range) - the set of values that the random variable can take.\n\nFor discrete random variables, it is the set of all the realizations that have a strictly positive probability of being observed.\nFor continuous random variables, it is the set of all numbers whose probability density is strictly positive.\nSee link for examples\n\nunderspecification - In general, the solution to a problem is underspecified if there are many distinct solutions that solve the problem equivalently.\nAn unbiased estimator is an accurate statistic that’s used to approximate a population parameter.\n\n“Accurate” in this sense means that it’s neither an overestimate nor an underestimate. If an overestimate or underestimate does happen, the mean of the difference is called a “bias.”\n\nWeak Law of Large Numbers (Bernoulli’s theorem) - states that if you have a sample of independent and identically distributed random variables, as the sample size grows larger, the sample mean will tend toward the population mean"

    "text": "Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)\n\nMisc\n\nWhy would we not always use a non-parametric test so we do not have to bother about testing for normality? The reason is that non-parametric tests are usually less powerful than corresponding parametric tests when the normality assumption holds. Therefore, all else being equal, with a non-parametric test you are less likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is false if the data follows a normal distribution. It is thus preferred to use the parametric version of a statistical test when the assumptions are met.\nIf your statistic value is greater than the critical value, then it’s significant and you reject H0\n\n\nThink in terms of a distribution with statistic values on the x-axis, and greater than the critical value means you’re in the tail (one-sided)\n\nT-Statistic Table\nZ-Statistic Table\n\nExample: 95% CI → α = 100% - 95% = 0.05 → α/2 (1-tail) = 0.025\n\n1 - 0.025 = 0.975 (subtract from 1 because the z-score table cells are for the area left of the critical value\nThe z-score is 1.96 for a 95% CI\n\n\nZ-score comes from adding the row value with the column value that has the cell value of our area (e.g. 0.975) left of the critical value\nIf the area was between 0.97441 and 0.97500, then the z-score would be the row value, 1.9, added to the column value that’s half way between 0.05 and 0.06, which results in a z-score of 1.955\n\n\n\n\nType I Error - False-Positive; occurs if an investigator rejects a null hypothesis that is actually true in the population\n\nThe models perform equally well, but the A/B test still produces a statistically significant result. As a consequence, you may roll out a new model that doesn’t really perform better.\nYou can control the prevalence of this type of error with the p-value threshold. If your p-value threshold is 0.05, then you can expect a Type I error in about 1 in 20 experiments, but if it’s 0.01, then you only expect a Type I error in only about 1 in 100 experiments. The lower your p-value threshold, the fewer Type I errors you can expect.\n\nType II Error - False-Negative; occurs if the investigator fails to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false in the population\n\nThe new model is in fact better, but the A/B test result is not statistically significant.\nYour test is underpowered, and you should either collect more data, choose a more sensitive metric, or test on a population that’s more sensitive to the change.\n\nType S Error (Sign Error): The A/B test shows that the new model is significantly better than the existing model, but in fact the new model is worse, and the test result is just a statistical fluke. This is the worst kind of error, as you may roll out a worse model into production which may hurt the business metrics.\n\n{retrodesign} - Provides tools for working with Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) errors. (Vignette)\n\nType M error (Magnitude Error): The A/B test shows a much bigger performance boost from the new model than it can really provide, so you’ll over-estimate the impact that your new model will have on your business metrics.\n\n{retrodesign} - Provides tools for working with Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) errors. (Vignette)\n\nFalse Positive Rate (FPR)(\\(\\alpha\\)) - ; Probability of a type I error; Pr(measured effect is significant | true effect is “null”)\n\\[\n\\text{FPR} = \\frac{v}{m_0}\n\\]\n\n\\(v\\): Number of times there’s a false positive\n\\(m_0\\): Number of non-significant variables\n\nFalse Discovery Rate (FDR) - Pr(measured effect is null | true effect is significant)\n\n\\[\n\\text{FDR} = \\frac{\\alpha \\pi_0}{\\alpha \\pi_0 + (1-\\beta)(1-\\pi_0)}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) - Type I error rate (False Positive Rate)\n\\(\\beta\\) - Type II error rate (False Negative Rate)\n\\(1-\\beta\\) - Power\n\\(\\pi_0\\) - Count of true null effects\n\\(1−\\pi_0\\) - Count of true non-null effects\n\nPower - 1-β where beta is the Probability of a type II error\nFamily-Wise Error Rate (FWER) - the risk of at least one false positive in a family of S hypotheses.\n\\[\nFWER = \\frac{v}{R}\n\\]\n\n\\(v\\): Number of times there’s a false positive\n\\(R\\): Number of times we claim β ≠ 0\ne.g. Using the same data and variables to fit multiple models with different outcome variables (i.e. different hypotheses)\n\nRomano and Wolf’s Ccorrection\n\nAccounting for the dependence structure of the p-values (or of the individual test statistics) produces more powerful procedures than Bonferroi and Holms. This can be achieved by applying resampling methods, such as bootstrapping and permutations methods.\n\nPermutation tests of regression coefficients can result in rates of Type I error which exceed the nominal size, and so these methods are likely not ideal for such applications\n\nSee Stata docs of the procedure\nPackages\n\n{wildrwolf}: Implements Romano-Wolf multiple-hypothesis-adjusted p-values for objects of type fixest and fixest_multi from the fixest package via a wild cluster bootstrap."

Its predicted value is 10 (based on β∗).\nOur data consists of five observed cases of Y with the values 6, 3, 22, 7, and 12.\nIn step 3, we predicted the values 7, 2, 20, 9, and 13 for these five observed cases (based on β^).\nThe predictive mean matching algorithm selects the closest observed values (typically three cases) to our missing value Yi. Hence, the algorithm selects the values 7, 9, and 13 (the closest values to 10).\n\n\nDraw randomly one of these three close cases and impute the missing value Yi with the observed value of this close case.\n\nExample continued:\n\nThe algorithm draws randomly from 6, 7, and 12 (the observed values that correspond to the predicted values 7, 9, and 13).\nThe algorithm chooses 12 and substitutes this value to Yi.\n\n\nIn case of multiple imputation (which I strongly advise), steps 1-5 are repeated several times.\n\nEach repetition of steps 1-5 creates a new imputed data set.\nWith multiple imputation, missing data is typically imputed 5 times.\n\n\nExample\ndata_imp &lt;- \n  complete(mice(data,\n           m = 5,\n           method = \"pmm\"))\n\nm is the number of times to impute the data\ncomplete formats the data into different shapes according to an action argument\nRunning parmice instead of mice imputes in parallel"

Serialization packages can provide an interface to capture this information, situate it within a portable object, and restore it for use in new settings.\n\n{crate} - formats the model into a binary file so it can be run by a system (e.g. API) regardless of the language used to create it\n\nsaves it as a bin file, crate.bin\n\n{bundle} - similar for tidymodels’ objects\n\nmlflow_save_model  creates a directory with the bin file and a MLProject file\nExamples\n\nUsing a function\nmlflow_save_model(carrier::crate(function(x) {\n            library(glmnet)\n            # glmnet requires a matrix\n            predict(model, as.matrix(x))\n}, model = mod), \"dir_name\")\n\npredict usually takes a df but glmnet requires a matrix\nmodel = mod is the parameter being passed into the function environment\n[dir_name][var.text] is the name of the folder that will be created\n\nUsing a lambda function\nmlflow_save_model(carrier::crate(~glmnet::predict.glmnet(model, as.matrix(.x)), model = mod), \"penal_glm\")\n\nRemoved the library function (could’ve done that before as well)\n*** lambda functions require .x instead of just x ***\nThe folder name is penal_glm\n\n\nServing a model as an API from the CLI\n&gt;&gt; mlflow models serve -m file:penal_glm\n\nmlflow runs mlflow.exe\nserve says create an API\n-m is for specifying the URI of the bin file\n\nCould be an S3 bucket\nfile: says it’s a local path\n\nDefault host:port 127.0.0.1:5000\n\n-h, -p can specify others\n\n*** Newdata needs to be in json column major format ***\n\nPrediction is outputted in json as well\nExample: Format in column major\njsonlite::toJSON(newdata_df, matrix = \"columnmajor\")\nExample: Send json newdata to the API\n# CLI example for \ncurl http://127.0.0.1:5000/invocations -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{    \"columns\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"],    \"data\": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]}'\n\n\n\n\n\nUI\n\nmlflow_ui( )\nClick date,\n\nmetric vs runs\nnotes\nartifact\n\nIf running through github\n\nlink to repo in source column for that run\nlink to commit (repo version) at the time of the run in the version column"

Likely important intermediaries or bridges\nCalculated by counting the number of shortest paths that pass through a node and dividing by the total number of shortest paths in the network.\n\nCloseness - Nodes with high closeness centrality have quick access to many other nodes. These nodes have the shortest distance, in network terms, to all other nodes.\n\nThese nodes are important in spreading information to all other nodes as quickly and efficiently as possible.\nCloseness Centrality = 1 / (Sum of SPD from the node to all other nodes)\n\nWhere SPD is the shortest path distance. In practice, this would be done with a shortest path algorithm like Breadth-First Search or Dijkstra’s algorithm.\n\n\n\n\nClusters\n\nCluster Clique - a cluster that has at least one node that’s connected to another node outside of the cluster\nCluster Silo - a cluster that has no node connected to any other node outside of the cluster\n\nClustering coefficient\n\nMeasures the density of a node’s local portion of the graph.\nNodes who have neighbors that are all connected to each other will have a higher clustering coefficient\n\nDegeneracy - A network model is degenerate when the space that an MCMC sampler can explore is so constrained that the only way to get the observed g(y) is essentially to flicker between full and empty graphs in the right proportion.\n\nA good indication that you have a degenerate model is that you have NA values for standard errors on your model parameter estimates. You can’t calculate a variance – and, therefore, a standard error – if you simply flicker between full and empty graphs.\n\nDegree aka Degree Centrality - Total edges a given node has.\nDensity - the number of edges in the observed network divided by the number of possible edges\nEdges (aka Dyads)- connection between two nodes. Depending on the type of connection, the edge can have a direction.\nEdge Bundling - visually bundle together similar edges to reduce the visual clutter within a graph\nMultiplexity - The number of connections between two nodes\n\nCould be represented by the thickness, darkness, etc. of an edge between 2 nodes\nNodes that have high multiplicity with each other typically form clusters\n\nRandom Graph - A network with n nodes where the edges between nodes occur randomly with probability P (each potential edge is one Bernoulli trial). Network density is typically used for P.\nTransitivity of a relation means that when there is a tie from i to j, and also from j to h, then there is also a tie from i to h: friends of my friends are my friends\n\n\nTransitivity Index (aka Clustering Index) = # Transitive Triads / # Potentially Transitive Triads\n\nHas a range between 0 and 1 where 1 is a transitive graph.\nFor random graphs, the expected value of the transitivity index is close to the density of the graph."

The LLM being trained gives a few answers to a question and then a human or better LLM will pick which one is best.\n\nPre-Trained LLMs are ones that are typically the open source ones being released and available for download\n\nThey will need to be Fine-Tuned, but not necessarily Classifier Fine-Tuned. Often times, LM Fine-Tuning is enough.\n\n\nWorkflow Example (paper)\n\nRaschka - An introduction to the core ideas and approaches to Finetuning Large Language Models - by Sebastian Raschka\nWith ChatGPT, you can have it answer questions from context that contains thousands of documents.\n\n\nStore all these documents as small chunks of text (allowable size of the context window) in a database.\nCreate embeddings of documents and question\nThe documents of relevance can then be found by computing similarities between the question and the document chunks. This is done typically by converting the chunks and question into word embedding vectors, and computing cosine similarities between chunks and question, and finally choosing only those chunks above a certain cosine similarity as relevant context.\nFinally, the question and context can be combined into a prompt as below, and fed into an LLM API like ChatGPT: prompt=f\"Answer the question.

    "section": "52.1 Misc",
    "text": "52.1 Misc\n\nWhat chatGPT is:\n\n“What would a response to this question sound like” machine Researchers build (train) large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 by using a process called “unsupervised learning,” which means the data they use to train the model isn’t specially annotated or labeled. During this process, the model is fed a large body of text (millions of books, websites, articles, poems, transcripts, and other sources) and repeatedly tries to predict the next word in every sequence of words. If the model’s prediction is close to the actual next word, the neural network updates its parameters to reinforce the patterns that led to that prediction.\nConversely, if the prediction is incorrect, the model adjusts its parameters to improve its performance and tries again. This process of trial and error, though a technique called “backpropagation,” allows the model to learn from its mistakes and gradually improve its predictions during the training process. As a result, GPT learns statistical associations between words and related concepts in the data set.\nIn the current wave of GPT models, this core training (now often called “pre-training”) happens only once. After that, people can use the trained neural network in “inference mode,” which lets users feed an input into the trained network and get a result. During inference, the input sequence for the GPT model is always provided by a human, and it’s called a “prompt.” The prompt determines the model’s output, and altering the prompt even slightly can dramatically change what the model produces.Iterative prompting is limited by the size of the model’s “context window” since each prompt is appended onto the previous prompt.  ChatGPT is different from vanilla GPT-3 because it has also been trained on transcripts of conversations written by humans. “We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides—the user and an AI assistant,”\nChatGPT has also been tuned more heavily than GPT-3 using a technique called “reinforcement learning from human feedback,” or RLHF, where human raters ranked ChatGPT’s responses in order of preference, then fed that information back into the model. This has allowed the ChatGPT to produce coherent responses with fewer confabulations than the base model. The prevalence of accurate content in the data set, recognition of factual information in the results by humans, or reinforcement learning guidance from humans that emphasizes certain factual responses.\nTwo major types of falsehoods that LLMs like ChatGPT might produce. The first comes from inaccurate source material in its training data set, such as common misconceptions (e.g., “eating turkey makes you drowsy”). The second arises from making inferences about specific situations that are absent from its training material (data set); this falls under the aforementioned “hallucination” label.\nWhether the GPT model makes a wild guess or not is based on a property that AI researchers call “temperature,” which is often characterized as a “creativity” setting. If the creativity is set high, the model will guess wildly; if it’s set low, it will spit out data deterministically based on its data set. If creativity is set low, “[It] answers ‘I don’t know’ all the time or only reads what is there in the Search results (also sometimes incorrect). What is missing is the tone of voice: it shouldn’t sound so confident in those situations.”\nIn some ways, ChatGPT is a mirror: It gives you back what you feed it. If you feed it falsehoods, it will tend to agree with you and “think” along those lines. That’s why it’s important to start fresh with a new prompt when changing subjects or experiencing unwanted responses.\n“One of the most actively researched approaches for increasing factuality in LLMs is retrieval augmentation—providing external documents to the model to use as sources and supporting context,” said Goodside. With that technique, he explained, researchers hope to teach models to use external search engines like Google, “citing reliable sources in their answers as a human researcher might, and rely less on the unreliable factual knowledge learned during model training.” Bing Chat and Google Bard do this already by roping in searches from the web, and soon, a browser-enabled version of ChatGPT will as well. Additionally, ChatGPT plugins aim to supplement GPT-4’s training data with information it retrieves from external sources, such as the web and purpose-built databases.\nOther things that might help with hallucination include, “a more sophisticated data curation and the linking of the training data with ‘trust’ scores, using a method not unlike PageRank… It would also be possible to fine-tune the model to hedge when it is less confident in the response.” (arstechnica article)\n\nOpenAI models\n\ndavinci (e.g. davinci-003) text-generation models are 10x more expensive than their chat counterparts (e.g. gpt-3.5-turbo)\nFor lower usage in the 1000’s of requests per day range ChatGPT works out cheaper than using open-sourced LLMs deployed to AWS.

    "text": "52.2 LangChain\n\nFramework for developing applications powered by language models; connect a language model to other sources of data; allow a language model to interact with its environment\nImplementation of the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models which demonstrates a prompting technique to allow the model to “reason” (with a chain-of-thoughts) and “act” (by being able to use a tool from a predefined set of tools, such as being able to search the internet). This combination is shown to drastically improve output text quality and give large language models the ability to correctly solve problems.\nMisc\n\nNotes from:\n\nA Gentle Intro to Chaining LLMs, Agents, and utils via LangChain\n\nSee article for workflow for multi-chains\nAlso shows some diagnostic methods that are included in the library\n\n\nAvailable vector stores for document embeddings\n\nAlso see Databases, Vector Databases\n\nSee article for description and link to code for a manual, more controlled parsing of markdown files to get text and code blocks\n\nIn general, chains are what you get by sequentially connecting one or more large language models (LLMs) in a logical way.\nChains can be built using LLMs or “Agents”.\n\nAgents provide the ability to answer questions that require recent or specialty information the LLM hasn’t been trained on.\n\ne.g. “What will the weather be like tomorrow?”\nAn agent has access to an LLM and a suite of tools for example Google Search, Python REPL, math calculator, weather APIs, etc. (list of supported agents)\nLLMs will use tools to interact with Agents (list of tools)\n\nTool process\n\nUses a LLMChain for building the API URL based on our input instructions and makes the API call.\nUpon receiving the response, it uses another LLMChain that summarizes the response to get the answer to our original question.\n\n\nReAct (Reason + Act) is a popular agent that picks the most usable tool (from a list of tools), based on what the input query is.\n\nOutput Components: observation, a thought, or it takes an action. This is mainly due to the ReAct framework and the associated prompt that the agent is using (See example with ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION)\n\nserpapi is useful for answering questions about current events.\n\n\nChains can be simple (i.e. Generic) or specialized (i.e. Utility).\n\nGeneric — A single LLM is the simplest chain. It takes an input prompt and the name of the LLM and then uses the LLM for text generation (i.e. output for the prompt).\n\nGeneric chains are more often used as building blocks for Utility chains\n\nUtility — These are specialized chains, comprised of many LLMs to help solve a specific task. For example,\n\nLangChain supports some end-to-end chains (such as AnalyzeDocumentChain for summarization, QnA, etc) and some specific ones (such as GraphQnAChain for creating, querying, and saving graphs). Programme Aided Language Model reads complex math problems (described in natural language) and generates programs (for solving the math problem) as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter.\n2-Chain Examples\n\nChain 1 is used to clean the prompt (remove extra whitespaces, shorten prompt, etc) and chain 2 is used to call an LLM with this clean prompt. (link)\nChain 1 is used to generate a synopsis for a play and chain is used to write a review based on this synopsis. (link)\n\n\n\nDocument Loaders (docs)- various helper functions that take various formats and types of data and produce a document output\n\nFormats like like markdown, word docs, text, PowerPoint, images, HTML, PDF, csvs, AsciiDoc (adoc), etc.\nExamples\n\nGitLoader function clones the repository and load relevant files as documents\nYoutubeLoader - gets subtitles from videos\nDataFrameLoader - converts text columns in panda dfs to documents\n\nAlso, tons of other functions for googledrive or dbs like bigquery, duckdb or cloud storage like s3 or confluence or email or discord, etc.\n\nText Spitters (Docs) - After loading the documents, they’re usually fed to text splitter to create chunks of text due to LLM context constraints. The chunks of text can then be transformed into embeddings.\n\nFrom “Sales and Support Chatbot” article in example below\n\n\n# Define text chunk strategy\nsplitter = CharacterTextSplitter(\n  chunk_size=2000,\n  chunk_overlap=50,\n  separator=\" \"\n)\n# GDS guides\ngds_loader = GitLoader(\n    clone_url=\"https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science\",\n    repo_path=\"./repos/gds/\",\n    branch=\"master\",\n    file_filter=lambda file_path: file_path.endswith(\".adoc\")\n    and \"pages\" in file_path,\n)\ngds_data = gds_loader.load()\n# Split documents into chunks\ngds_data_split = splitter.split_documents(gds_data)\nprint(len(gds_data_split)) #771\n\nEmbeddings\n\nOpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 model is easy to work with, achieves the highest performance out of all of OpenAI’s embedding models (on the BEIR benchmark), and is also the cheapest ($0.0004/1K tokens).\nHuggingFace’s sentence-transformers , which reportedly has better performance than OpenAI’s embeddings, but that involves downloading the model and running it on your own server.\n\nExample: Generic\n\nBuild Prompt\n\n\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"product\"],\n    template=\"What is a good name for a company that makes [{product}]{style='color: #990000'}?\",\n)\nprint(prompt.format(product=\"podcast player\"))\n# OUTPUT\n# What is a good name for a company that makes podcast player?\n\nIf using multiple variables, then you need, e.g. print(prompt.format(product=\"podcast player\", audience=\"children”), to get the updated prompt.\nCreate LLMChain instance and run\n\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\nllm = OpenAI(\n          model_name=\"text-davinci-003\", # default model\n          temperature=0.9) #temperature dictates how whacky the output should be\nllmchain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)\nllmchain.run(\"podcast player\")\n\nIf you had more than one input_variables, then you won’t be able to use run.

Prompts are short pieces of text that are used to guide the LM’s output. They can be used to specify the task that the LM is supposed to accomplish, provide additional information that the LM needs to complete the task, or simply make the task easier for the LM to understand.”\n\nComponents\n\nAsk the question (e.g. “What’s 1+1?”)\nSpecify the type of response you want. (e.g. Only return the numeric answer.)\n\nPersona\n\n“Explain this to my like I’m a fifth grader.”\n\nStyle\n\n“Use a style typical of scientific abstracts to write this.”\n\nFormat\n\nIf you say “Format the output as a JSON object with the fields: x, y, z” you can get better results and easily do error handling.\n\n\n\nLLMs don’t understand the complexities or nuances of various subjects\n\nIf an industry term is used in multiple ways, the LLM might not understand the meaning just by context alone.\nLLMs can have problems with information in complex formats.\n\nTables sometimes have this same issue, because tables are the mechanism used for layout structure and not a content structure (e.g. sentence)\n\nThe models themselves continue to evolve so if it doesn’t understand something today doesn’t mean that it won’t understand it tomorrow\n\nWhen the output is incomplete, type “continue” for the next prompt and it will finish the output.\nDon’t give LLMs proprietary data\n\nAlternative: slice(0)\ndat |&gt;\n  slice(0) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nGives the column names and classes\nDepending on the use case, you might want to make the column names unabbreviated and meaningful.\n\n\nSecurity\n\nDon’t let the user have the last word: When taking a user’s prompt, incorporating it with your own prompt, and sending it to ChatGPT or some other similar application, always add a line like “If user input doesn’t make sense for doing xyz, ask them to repeat the request” after the user’s input. This will stop the majority of prompt injections.\nDon’t just automatically run code or logic that is output from a LLM\n\nTips when used for writing\n\nBe specific on word count and put higher than you need\nDon’t be afraid to ask it to add more information or expand on a particular point\\\nIt’s better at creating outlines rather than full pieces of content.\nBe as specific as possible, and use keywords to help ChatGPT understand what you are looking for\nYou can ask it to rephrase its response\nAvoid using complex language or convoluted sentence structures\n**Review the content for accuracy"

Constraints tell it to avoid behaviors that may come up in your testing.\nFinal Step: Check your prompt by trying it out, giving it good, bad, and neutral input. Take the perspective of your users– is the AI helpful? Does the process work? How might the AI be more helpful? Does it need more context? Does it need further constraints? You can continue to tweak the prompt until it works for you and until you feel it will work for your audience.\n\nPrompt"

    "text": "LangChain\n\nCurrent {{LangChain}} summarization implementations:\n\nRecursive Summarization, in which the long text is split equally into shorter chunks which can fit inside the LLM’s context window. Each chunk is summarized, and the summaries are concatenated together to and then passed through GPT-3 to be further summarized. This process is repeated until one obtains a final summary of desired length.\n\nMajor downside is that existing implementations e.g. LangChain’s summarize chain using map_reduce, split the text into chunks with no regard for the logical and structural flow of the text.\nFor example, if the article is 1000 words long, a chunk size of 200 would mean that we would get 5 chunks. What if the author has several main points, the first of which takes up the first 250 words?\n\nRefine method, which passes a chunk of text, along with a summary of the previous chunks, through the LLM, which progressively refines the summary as it sees more of the text. See prompt for details. - Sequential nature of the process means that it cannot be parallelized and takes linear time, far longer than a recursive method which takes logarithmic time - Meaning from the beginning parts of the text could be overrepresented in the final summary. This would be bad if the beginning text has something not germane like advertisements in it.\n\n2-Stage Topic Summarization Method:\n\nDescription:\n\nSplit the summary outputs from one step of the recursive summarization into chunks to be fed into the next step.\nCluster chunks semantically into topics and pass topics into the next iteration of the summarization.\nIt does not drastically increase the LLM costs — we are still passing just as much input as the conventional method into the LLM, yet we get a much richer summarization.\n\nNotes from Summarize Podcast Transcripts and Long Texts Better with NLP and AI\nExample: Summarize Biden state of the union speech\n\nPreprocessing:\n\nSplit the raw text it into sentences, restricting sentences to have a minimum length of 20 words and maximum length of 80.\nCreate chunks of sentences. Chunk size should be the number of sentences it generally takes to express a discrete idea. Example uses 5 sentences (but you can experiment with other numbers) with 1-sentence overlap between chunks, just to ensure continuity so that each chunk has some contextual information about the previous chunk.\n\nMaybe figure out the average count of sentences per paragraph.\nThis article tried something a little more extreme by chunking each paragraph (At least I think that’s what this means. It’s a fucking run-on sentence.) Might not of worked because maybe he had a lot of 1 sentence paragraphs?\n\n“Initially, I also tried splitting the text blocks into paragraphs, hypothesizing that because a section may contain information about many different topics, the embedding for that entire section may not be similar to an embedding for a text prompt concerned with only one of those topics. This approach, however, resulted in top matches for most search queries disproportionately being single line paragraphs, which turned out to not be terribly informative as search results.”\nResulted in 65 chunks, with an average chunk length is 148 words, and a range from 46–197 words\n\n\n\nProduce a Title and Summary for each chunk.\n# Prompt to get title and summary for each chunk\nmap_prompt_template = \"\"\"\n    Firstly, give the following text an informative title. Then, on a new line, write a 75-100 word summary of the following text:\n    [{text}]{style='color: #990000'}\n    Return your answer in the following format:\n    Title | Summary...\n    e.g.\n    Why Artificial Intelligence is Good | AI can make humans more productive by automating many repetitive processes.\n    TITLE AND CONCISE SUMMARY:\n\"\"\"\n\nPrompt for gpt3 model with title and summary output separated by a bar, |.\n\nTransform summaries of chunks into embeddings\n\nPass summaries to an openai or huggingface model to get embeddings\n\nGroup semantically-similar chunks together into topics\n\nCreate a chunk similarity matrix, where the (i,j)th entry denotes the cosine similarity between the embedding vectors of the ith and jth chunk ({{scipy}} for cosine similarity function)\nUse the Louvain community detection algorithm to detect topics from the chunks ({{networkx}} for Louvain algorithm)\n\nHas a hyperparameter called resolution — small resolutions lead to smaller clusters.\nAdditionally, a hyperparameter proximity_bonus  is created, which bumps up the similarity score of chunks if their position in the original text is closer to each other. You can interpret this as treating the temporal structure of the text as a prior (i.e. chunks closer to each other are more likely to be semantically similar).\nAnother example, using a Bloomberg podcast transcript, shows how this method detected blocks of advertisements.\n\n\nProduce a title for each topic\n\nFor much longer texts like books, repeat this process several times until there are ~10 topics left whose topic summaries can fit into the context window.\nEach topic has a number of chunks associated with it. Titles were produced for each chunk earlier in the process. So, loop each topic’s chunks’ list of titles through an LLM to get a refined title for that topic.\nDo this concurrently (i.e. simultaneously) for all topics to prevent the topics’ titles from being too similar with one another.\nThis output will be the label of each topic (see Visualization section)\n\nProduce a summary for each topic\n\nSimilar to the previous section.\nFeed chunk summaries of each topic to GPT-3, and get a refined summary\nSame as befeore, this needs to be done concurrently\n\nFinal Summary: To arrive at the overall summary of the text, concatenate the topic summaries together and prompt GPT-3 to summarize them.\n\nVisualization"

Each step (document embedding, dimensionality reduction, clustering) is virtually self-consistent and can change or evolve depending on the advancements in the field, the peculiarities of a specific project or technical constraints.\n\nexample: use BERTopic with Doc2Vec embeddings instead of SBERT, or apply K-Means clustering instead of HDBSCAN.\n\nThey scale better with larger corpora compared with conventional approaches.\nBoth BERTopic and Top2Vec provide advanced built-in search and visualization capabilities. They make simpler to investigate the quality of the topics and drive further optimization, as well as producing high-quality charts for presentations.\n\nCons\n\nThey work better on shorter text, such as social media posts or news headlines.\n\nMost transformers-based embeddings have a limit on the number of tokens they can consider when they build a semantic representation. It is possible to use these algorithms with longer documents. One may, for example, split the documents in sentences or paragraphs before the embedding step. Nevertheless, this may not necessarily benefit the generation of meaningful and representative topics for longer documents.\n\nEach document is assigned to one topic only.\n\nTraditional approaches like LDA, instead, were built on the assumption that each document contains a mixture of topics.\nThe probability distribution of the HDBSCAN may be used as proxy of the topics distribution\n\nThey are slower compared to conventional models (Grootendorst, 2022).\n\nFaster training and inference may require more expensive hardware accelerators (GPU).\n\nAlthough BERTopic leverages transformers-based large language models to manufacture document embeddings, the topic representation still uses a bag-of-word approach (c TF-IDF).\nThey may be less effective for small datasets (&lt;1000 docs) (Egger et al., 2022)."

Changing your model’s architecture can change the dimensionality of the embedding vectors. If the layers become larger/smaller, your vectors will too.\nUse another extraction method: In the event of the model not changing, you can still try several embedding extraction methods and compare between them.\nRetraining your model: Once you retrain the model from which you extract the embeddings, the parameters that define it will change. Hence, the values of the components of the vectors will change as well.\n\nPre-trained models\n\nGoogle’s T5-11b (open sourced in 2019) requires a cluster of expensive GPUs simply to load and make predictions. Fine-tuning these systems requires even more resources\nOpenAI\n\nGPT-3 requires a significant number of GPUs simply to load.\nGPT-2 was originally announced in early 2019 and, thus, trained on data collected on or before that date\nGPT-J was released in 2021\n\ntechniques such as model distillation and noisy student training are being rapidly developed by the research community to reduce model size\n\nTransformers Compared to Other DL Architecture\n\nRNNs implement sequential processing: The input (let’s say sentences) is processed word by word.\nTransformers use non-sequential processing: Sentences are processed as a whole, rather than word by word\nThe LSTM requires 8 time-steps to process the sentences, while BERT requires only 2\n\nBERT is better able to take advantage of parallelism, provided by modern GPU acceleration\n\nRNNs are forced to compress their learned representation of the input sequence into a single state vector before moving to future tokens.\nLSTMs solved the vanishing gradient issue that vanilla RNNs suffer from, but they are still prone to exploding gradients. Thus, they are struggling with longer dependencies\nTransformers, on the other hand, have much higher bandwidth. For example, in the Encoder-Decoder Transformer model, the Decoder can directly attend to every token in the input sequence, including the already decoded.\nTransformers use a special case called Self-Attention: This mechanism allows each word in the input to reference every other word in the input.\nTransformers can use large Attention windows (e.g. 512, 1048). Hence, they are very effective at capturing contextual information in sequential data over long ranges.\n\n\nTerms\n\nCoreference Resolution (article)\n\n‘Daddy’, ‘He’ and ‘His’ refer to the same entity, identifying those entities and linking them to their antecedent is called co-reference resolution\nUse cases: Information Extraction, Question Answering, Summarization, Machine Translation\nModels:\n\nF-coref - {{fastcoref}}, Fastcoref — A Practical Package for Coreference Resolution\n\n\nSemantic Search - A text query is transformed into an embedding then the most similar document embeddings are found and returned\n\ne.g. a search engines; Google uses BERT on a large percentage of their queries\n\nZipf’s Law - the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.

Otherwise, we are not able to use CLT to assert normality for our mean statistics.\nIn A/B experiments where we randomize by users (this is usually the default option because each user would have an inconsistent product experience if we randomize by sessions), a user can have multiple click events or view events, and these events will be correlated.\n\nTherefore, sample variance will no longer be an unbiased estimate of the population variance\nCan result in spuriously low p-values\n\n\nDelta method converts the pageview metric to a user-level metric where independence and iid assumption hold\n\n\narticle with py code\nWith the correct variance, you can perform the t-test and get the p-value\n\nBootstrap method - repeatedly draw many samples from all the view events in each group stratified by user ids, then calculate many mean statistics from these bootstrap samples, and estimate the variance for these statistics accordingly.\n\nStratifying by user ID ensures i.i.d. assumption is met and the variance estimation is trustworthy.\nComputationally expensive as the simulation is basically manipulating and aggregating the tens of billions of user logs for many iterations (Complexity ~ O(nB) where n is the sample size and B is the number of bootstrap iterations).\nWith the correct variance, you can perform the t-test and get the p-value\n\n\nPercentile Metrics\n\nMany business aspects are characterized by edge cases and thus are better described by quantile metrics\n\ne.g. 95th percentile page load time/latency\n\nIssue is that some of these defined at the Pageview level and not at the user-level (i.e. randomization level)(For more details, see Pageview-level Conversion Metrics)\nBootstrap method - Use to estimate the empirical variance and t-test the sample means of percentile metrics ((For more details, see Pageview-level Conversion Metrics)\nProportional Z-test\n\nFor details, see the article and Ch 8.6 of Causal Inference and Its Applications in Online Industry\n\n\nSum Metrics (Not Recommended)\n\nAggregated counts\n\ne.g. total number of the article read, the total Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), the total videos posted\n\nArticle says these sum metrics are problematic because of business fluctuations (user average metrics) and by the inevitable random error introduced by the traffic diversion\n\nI don’t know what this means and the article didn’t explain it well.\nThere may be a better explanation in the book in the previous section\nThere are also references at the end of the article\n\nRecommended to test the effectiveness/statistical significance of the product feature using a user average metric and calculating the incremental lift in the SUM metrics"

It’s suited for situations where you’re interested in group-level comparisons (e.g., comparing the average test scores of students from different schools).\nRegression, on the other hand, is used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It’s suitable for predicting or explaining a continuous outcome variable.\n\nData Type:\n\nANOVA is often used with categorical independent variables and a continuous dependent variable. It helps assess whether the categorical variable has a significant impact on the continuous variable.\nRegression can be used with both categorical and continuous independent variables to predict a continuous dependent variable or to examine the relationship between variables.\n\nMultiple Factors:\n\nANOVA is designed to handle situations with multiple categorical independent variables (factors) and their interactions. It is useful when you are interested in understanding the combined effects of several factors.\nRegression can accommodate multiple independent variables as well, but it focuses on predicting the value of the dependent variable rather than comparing groups.\n\nHypothesis Testing:\n\nANOVA tests for differences in means among groups and provides p-values to determine whether those differences are statistically significant.\nRegression can be used for hypothesis testing, but it’s more often used for estimating the effect size and making predictions.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nANOVA assumes that the groups are independent and that the residuals (the differences between observed values and group means) are normally distributed and have equal variances.\nRegression makes similar assumptions about residuals but also assumes a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables.\n\n\nAssumptions\n\nEach group category has a normal distribution.\nEach group category is independent of each other and identically distributed (iid)\nGroup categories have of similar variance (i.e. homoskedastic variance)\n\nIf this is violated\n\nand the ratio of the largest variance to the smallest variance is less than 4, then proceed with one-way ANOVA (robust to small differences)\nand the ratio of the largest variance to the smallest variance is greater than 4, we may instead choose to perform a Kruskal-Wallis test. This is considered the non-parametric equivalent to the one-way ANOVA.

However, it won’t pinpoint the pairs of means that are different. Duncan’s Multiple Range Test will identify the pairs of means (from at least three) that differ. The MRT is similar to the LSD, but instead of a t-value, a Q Value is used.\n\nFisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD)\n\nA tool to identify which pairs of means are statistically different.

Newman-Keuls uses different critical values for comparing pairs of means. Therefore, it is more likely to find significant differences.\n\nRodger’s Method\n\nConsidered by some to be the most powerful post-hoc test for detecting differences among groups. This test protects against loss of statistical power as the degrees of freedom increase.\n\nScheffé’s Method\n\nUsed when you want to look at post-hoc comparisons in general (as opposed to just pairwise comparisons). Scheffe’s controls for the overall confidence level. It is customarily used with unequal sample sizes.\n\nTukey’s Test\n\nThe purpose of Tukey’s test is to figure out which groups in your sample differ. It uses the “Honest Significant Difference,” a number that represents the distance between groups, to compare every mean with every other mean.\n\nDunnett’s Test\n\nLike Tukey’s this post-hoc test is used to compare means.

    "text": "Levels of Maturity\n\nFrom 5 Levels of MLOps Maturity\n\nAuthor’s recommendations based on reading Google’s and Microsofts docs on MLOps\nAdditional Thoughts\n\nYou should monitor your model as soon as business decisions are taken based on its output, regardless of maturity level. At the very least, performance monitoring to be employed. In addition to determining model failure, results can be used to calculate ROI i.e. business value.\n\nLevel 1- Manual\n\n\nData processing, experimentation, and model deployment processes are entirely manual.\nRelies heavily on skilled data scientists, with some assistance from a data engineer to prepare the data and a software engineer to integrate the model with the product/business processes if needed.\nUse Cases\n\nEarly-stage start-ups and proof of concept projects\nSmall-scale ML applications with minimal data dependencies and real-time requirements — applications with limited scope or a small user base, like a small online fashion store.\nAd hoc ML tasks — In specific scenarios like marketing campaigns, one-time ML tasks or analyses may not require full MLOps implementation.\n\nLimitations\n\nLack of monitoring system — there’s no visibility on the model’s performance. If it degrades, it will have a negative business impact.\nNo frequent retrains of production models. Releases of the models happen only a couple of times per year.\nLimited documentation and no versioning\n\n\nLevel 2 - Repeatable\n\n\nDevOps aspect added to the infrastructure by converting the experiments to the source code and storing them in the source repository using a version control system like Git.\nData catalog — a centralized repository that includes information such as data source, data type, data format, owner, usage, and lineage. It helps to organize, manage, and maintain large volumes of data in a scalable and efficient manner.\nAdd Automated testing — unit tests, integration tests, or regression tests. These will help us deploy faster and make things more reliable by ensuring our code changes don’t cause errors or bugs.\nStill lacks a monitoring system\n\nLevel 3 - Reproducible\n\n\nTwo key reasons why reproducibility is crucial: troubleshooting and collaboration.\nNew Features\n\nAutomated training pipeline — handles the end-to-end process of training models, from data preparation to model evaluation.\nMetadata store — a database is a way to track and manage metadata, including data sources, model configurations, hyperparameters, training runs, evaluation metrics, and all the experiments data.\nModel registry — is a repository to store ML models, their versions, and their artifacts necessary for deployment, which helps to retrieve the exact version if needed.\nFeature store — which is there to help data scientists and machine learning engineers to develop, test, and deploy machine learning models more efficiently by providing a centralized location for storing, managing, and serving features. It also can be used to track the evolution of features over time and preprocess and transform features as needed.\n\n\nLevel 4 - Automated\n\n\nNew Features\n\nCI/CD — where Continuous Integration (CI) ensures integration of code changes from different team members into a shared repository, while Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the deployment of validated code to production environments. This allows for rapid deployment of model updates, improvements, and bug fixes.\nA/B testing of models — this model validation method involves comparing predictions and user feedback between an existing model and a candidate model to determine the better one.\n\n\nLevel 5 - Continuous Improvement\n\n\nModel is automatically retrained based on the trigger from the monitoring system. This process of retraining is also known as continuous learning. The objectives of continuous learning are:\n\nCombat sudden data drifts that may occur, ensuring the model remains effective even when faced with unexpected changes in the data.\nAdapt to rare events such as Black Friday, where patterns and trends in the data may significantly deviate from the norm.\nOvercoming the cold start problem, which arises when the model needs to make predictions for new users lacking historical data\n\n\n\nGoogle (E-Commerce Analysis Pipeline)\n\nInitial Stage\n\n\nData collection layer: presents the most relevant data sources that had to be initially imported to our data warehouse.\nData integration layer: presents cron jobs used for importing e-commerce datasets and the Funnel.io platform for importing performance marketing datasets to our data warehouse.\nData storage layer: presents the selected data warehouse solution, i.e. BigQuery.\nData modelling and presentation layer: presents the data analytics platform of choice, i.e. Looker.\nResources\n\n2 tools — BigQuery and Looker,\n6 people — for managing data pipelines (cron jobs + Funnel.io platform) and initial analytical requirements (data modelling),\n3 months —from acquiring Google Cloud to presenting the first analytical insights.\n\n\nAdvanced Stage\n\n\nCloud storage — for storing our external files in Google Cloud.\nCloud Run — used for deploying analytical pipelines developed in Python and wrapped as Flask applications.\nGoogle Functions — for writing simple, single-purpose functions attached to events emitted from the cloud services.\nGoogle Workflows — used for orchestrating connected analytical pipelines that needed to be executed in a specific order.\nGoogle Colab — for creating quick PoC data science models.\nResources\n\nFrom 2 to 7 tools — from using only BigQuery and Looker, we started using Cloud storage, Cloud Run, Google Functions, Google Workflows, and Google Colab.\nFrom 6 people in two teams (IT and Business Development) to 8 people in one team (Data and Analytics) — the Data and Analytics team was established and now has complete ownership over all data layers.\nFrom 3 months for creating initial insights to 2+ years of continuous development — we are gradually developing more advanced analytical use cases."

This model monitor could then flag potential drift during operation of the primary system\n\n\n\nIf predictions result in an intervention, it will be difficult to determine drift.\n\nExample: patient is determined to be at high risk by a model, gets treated by clinician, and lives. Was this a false positive by the model or was the model correct and the reason for the patient living is the clinician’s intervention.\n\nOther tracking\n\nNumber of alerts triggered by model\n\nWork with users to minimize false positives and hence unnecessary alerts. Otherwise model alerts might be treated as the boy that cried wolf and will be ignored or taken less seriously.\n\nInterventions after a trigger\n\nThis will let you know if your model predictions are being adhered to\nExample: model that predicts a patient is at high risk of death and triggers an alert to a clinician\n\nPart of the standard protocol for intervening after a patient is labelled high risk is to perform additional vitals measurements. The number of vitals measurements for a patient are recorded, so this metric can be used a proxy. If there is an increase in a high risk patient’s vital measurments, then the data team can infer that it’s model’s alerts are being adhered to.\n\n\nAutomated Retraining Triggers\n\nRequirements:\n\nThe number of models in production is limited so retraining costs are low.\n\nRetail, logistics, etc. may involve thousands of related (e.g geography) models\n\nThe frequency of triggering events is rare.\nThere are no strict requirements on model availability.\n\n\nPredicting model drift\n\nImportant, so:\n\nSLA requirements related to model availability can be met.\nAnalysis can be done on such cases for root cause analysis in pre-production settings.\nComputational requirements for retraining can be calculated in advance knowing the frequency and prevalence of these events across the models.\n\nsurvival analysis to model performance decay in predictive models.\n\nData requirements:\n\nSufficient historical scoring data is available on 1 model\nOr scoring data is on a large number of closely related models\n\nOnce you have the probability of survival distribution, you can could use the 95th percentile survival time to trigger a model retrain to ensure that the model degradation is below the performance threshold with the specified probability\n\n\nModel calls\n\nIf model usage drops or becomes irratic, it could be a signal something is wrong\nOnly useful for frequently used apps\nDepending on the model environment, you might want to check requests and responses separately.\n\nWas the model not asked (e.g., because a recommendation widget crashed) or failed to answer (e.g., the model timed out and we had to use a static recommendation instead)? The answer would point to where you should start debugging.\n\n\nCompetitor feature distributions\n\nWould be useful in diagnosing if the changes in data are just your company or happening to the industry sector\n\nSHAP for Drift Detection: Effective Data Shift Monitoring Feeds distribution of SHAP values into a logistic regression, then applies ks test on probability predictions for Y==1, Y==0\nMeasuring Precision and Recall\n\nActions taken by model\n\nSoft Actions - Events are flagged for humans to take action\nHard Actions - Events are flagged and actions are automatically taken by an algorithm\n\nPrecision: ratio of positive predictions that are correct (Precision = TP / (TP + FP))\n\nSoft Action models - Record human decisions that are made on the flagged events\nHard Action models - Set up a control group: for a fraction of the volume, let a human decide, instead of your model. Then the precision in the control group is an estimate of the precision of your model\n\nRecall: ratio of all positive events that the model is detecting (Recall = TP / (TP + FN))\n\nNeed to audit your negative predictions to count the number of False Negatives (FN)\nIssue: Imbalanced classes (e.g. fraud model)\n\nIf recall is expected to be 99.9%. That means that, on average, you’d need to audit at least 1K negatives per day just to find just one false negative, and even more for that number to be statistically meaningful.\n\nSolution: Importance Sampling (Google blog post)\n\nSample negative predictions based on their model scores\nSample more heavily from datapoints with high model scores because that’s where we expect most of our false negatives to be\n\n\n\n\nIf you are dealing with a high-risk domain, it is best to design model fallbacks from the get-go in case of model failure from broke code, concept drift, etc.\n\nExamples\n\nMake a human do what the model was doing (e.g. insurance claims processing, manufacturing quality control, or sales lead scoring)\nRule-based approach: You can often design a set of rules or heuristics that will be less precise but more robust than a rogue model. (e.g. simply show the most popular items to all customers)\n\n\nNotes from https://blog.anomalo.com/effective-data-monitoring-8bce3ddf87b4\n\nAll the stuff that platform, Anomalo, does\n\nIdentifying issues and retraining models will minimize losses\n\ndeviations between baseline and production distributions\nfeature and cohort performance\n\nML transparency regulation requires it to understand why a model made a particular prediction to ensure broader governance, fairness, and mitigate bias\n\nKeep track of predictions by group\n\nDynamic testing can prevent false positives/negatives\n\nUse a forecasting method to generate prediction intervals. If data values for a variable fall outside the PIs, then a data quality alert is triggered\n\nLimiting tests to the most recent data can reduce data warehouse costs\nCreate application (or subscribe to a service) that enables a user to adjust commonly changed rules/thresholds without writing code\n\nShould be well documented\nThe types of changes users often make include:\n\nWidening the expected range for a data outcome\nNarrowing the scope of a rule using a where SQL clause\nWaiting for updated-in-place data to arrive before applying a rule\nChanging thresholds for machine learning alerts\neasy reversion to prior state\n\nso will need a log/versioning\n\n\n\nFor data that is critical. Checks should be included in the pipeline\n\nIf a check does fail, you could run automated tasks to fix the bad data, abort the remainder of the DAG (sometimes, no data is better than bad data), or quarantine bad records using SQL produced in the API to query for good and bad data.\n\nIf you have hundreds of variables, managing data quality rules for each column may be untenable.\n\nUse unsupervised data monitoring\n\nno increase in NULL values\n\nA constrained model looking for significant increases in NULL values\n\nno anomalous records\n\nmachine learning algorithm, which identifies changes in continuous distributions, categorical values, time durations, or even relationships between columns\nscore severity of anomaly somehow\n\n\n\nRoute alerts (slack) for a particular table only to teams that regularly use or maintain that table\n\nAs alerts arrive, they can use emoji reactions to classify their response to alerts. Common reactions include: * ✅ the issue has been fixed * 🔥 an important alert * 🛠️ a fix is underway * 🆗 expected behavior, nothing needed * 👀 under review\n\nAlerts should have contextual information\n\nExample\n\nWhy does this alert matter?\nWhat # and % of user_id values are affected?\nHow often has this alert failed in the recent past?\nWho configured this alert, and why?\nWhat dashboards or ML models depend on fact_table?\nWhat raw data source contributed user_id to fact_table ?\n\nInclude image with a row with a value that triggered the alert and a row that has a valid value\n\nRoot cause analysis\n\nUses statistical method to find out where the issue is\n\ngroup_by(cat) %&gt;% summarize(pct_bad = … whatever)\npermute rows of anomalous column and see where there’s a relationship change between anomalous column/rows and other columns. The columns where the relationship changes might be potentially involved in the anomalous values of the permuted column\n\nclustering or correlation?\n\n\n\nGet user feedback on alerts (useful or not useful?)\n\nGround Truth Latency - how long does it take to know if your prediction was right\n\nRealtime/near realtime\n\nstocks, gambling, food delivery time estimates, digital advertising\nAble to determine whether there’s an issue with your model almost immediately\n\ndelayed\n\ncredit card fraud\nRequires monitoring of proxy metrics (metrics that are associated with the ground truth) until ground truth arrives\n\n\nProblematic ground truth types\n\nBiased\n\nExample: loan default model\n\nThe ground truth only includes results from customers who were approved for a loan. So there’s no information about whether a person who was denied a loan would’ve repaid it back or not\n\nSolution: An occasional A/B test where a group of customers applying for the loan isn’t subject to model predictions of whether they’re credit worthy or not (control group) and a group that is subject to model predictions (treatment group)\n\nLittle to zero or sporadic ground truth feedback\n\nRequires monitoring of proxy metrics (metrics that are associated with the ground truth)\nManual collection of ground truth data\n\ncan be expensive but high quality ground truth data is very important\n\n\n\ndata required for monitoring\n\nIf customer facing, then the data should that which is necessary to calculate service level indicators (SLI) which will help the company keep its customer obligations which are outlined in the service level agreement (SLA) (see link for more details)\nTypes\n\nUnique Id per request provided by the system that called the ML model. This unique identifier will be stored with each log and will allow us to follow the path of a prediction before, during and after the ML model.\nInput features before feature engineering\nInput features after feature engineering\nOutput probabilities\nPredicted value\n\nData size required to be able to measure a metric accurately\n\nHow many observations do I need so that I know the metric I’m measuring is accurate.\nDepends on metric and threshold for the accuracy of that metric.\nExample:\n\nclassification with imbalanced dataset, 1/100 is a positive event\nRecall = 90%\n\nThe model should get 90% of all true positive correct\n\nThreshold (aka shot noise) = 0.1%\n\nThe maximum error in measuring recall is 0.1%. So, a model with 90.0009% recall would trigger a model retrain\n\nshot_noise &lt;- ((pos_rate * data_size) * (1-recall)) / data_size\n\nI don’t see how to solve this for data_size (i.e. data_size cancels out) so I guess this is an optimization problem\n\n\n\n\nChanges in the distribution of input and output features\n\nTriggers for retraining model (if possible, use both)\n\nusing performance based triggers is good for use-cases where there is fast feedback and high volume of data, like real time bidding, where you are able to measure the model’s performance as close as possible to the time of predictions, in short time intervals and with high confidence (high volume).\n\nThe main limitation when relaying on performance only, is the time it takes for you to obtain your ground truth — if you obtain it at all. In user conversion prediction cases, it can take 30 or 60 days until you will get a ground truth, or even 6 months or more in cases such as transaction fraud detection or LTV. If you need to wait so long to have full feedback, that means you’ll retrain the model too late, after the business has already been impacted.\n\nBy measuring changes in the input data, i.e. changes in the distribution of features that are used by the model, you can detect data drifts that indicate your model may be outdated and needs to be retained on fresh data.\n\nMissing values can occur regularly at ML model inference. Even when missing values are allowed in features, a model can see a lot more missing values than in the training set. An example of a missing value error is an ML model making an inference based on a form input where a previously optional field is now always sending a null value input due to a code error.\nRange violation happens when the model input exceeds the expected range of its values. It is quite common for categorical inputs to have typos and cardinality mismatches to cause this problem, e.g. free form typing for categories and numerical fields like age, etc. An unknown product SKU, an incorrect country, and inconsistency in categorical values due to pipeline state are all examples of range violation.\nType mismatch arises when the model input type is different from the one provided at inference time. One way types get mismatched is when column order gets misaligned during some data wrangling operations.\n\n\n\nTrack distance metrics between reference variable distribution and a production variable distribution\n\nThe production variable distributions should include feature variable data entering the pipeline and prediction output from the models\nUpward trends in the distance between baseline and operational data distributions can be the basis of data drift detection.\nPotential reference distributions (i.e. monitoring window)\n\na distribution across a fixed time window (distribution doesn’t change). Examples:\n\ntraining distribution\nvalidation/test set distribution.\ninitial model deployment distribution (or a time when the distribution was thought to be stable)\n\na distribution across a moving time window (distribution can change)\n\nlast week’s input data with this week’s input data\n\nConsiderations\n\nRepresentation differences: Class ratios across windows may not be the same (e.g., the fraction of positives in one window may be very different from the fraction of positives in another window).\nVarying sample sizes: The number of data points in each window may vary (e.g., the number of requests received on a Sunday is less than the number of requests received on a Monday).\nDelayed feedback: Due to reasonable events (e.g., loss of Internet connection), labels may come in at a lag, making it impossible to factor in predictions without a label into the current window’s evaluation metric.\n\n\nTrack predictions by group (cohort performance)\n\nDrift may impact groups differently.\n\ne.g. persons with high net worth, low FICO scores, recent default, etc.\n\nGroups that are very important to the company should be tracked at the very least.\nMakes misclassified or poorly predicted observations exportable, so they can be studied further\n\nmaybe version these\n\n\nOther stuff to track\n\nNumber of predictions made\nPrediction latency — How long it takes to make a prediction\nIf the product is customer facing, then customer satisfaction/usage type metrics should also be tracked\n\nThresholds\n\nSee Automating Data Drift Thresholding in Machine Learning Systems\n\nAuthor was lame. He coded the impractical solution and didn’t code the good solution.\n\nComputationally intensive method (may not be practical)\n\nBootstrap or MC simulate the feature at the size of the production dataset or whatever the amount of data you’re going to test for drift\nFor each simulation, measure the drift (e.g. PSI, JS Divergence) between the simulated dataset and the training dataset.\nThreshold =  mean(drift) of all the simulations If any production/inference dataset has a drift &gt; threashold then that should trigger an alert\n\nClosed method for PSI\n\nSupposedly can be calculated for other distance measures.\nFinal Solution for the threshold 🥴\n\n\nK is the number of bins (numeric) or levels (categorical)\nPk is the percentage of total training observations == level_K or the percent of total training observations in bin K\nαk = 1 + Nq + Pk\n\nNq = sample size of the production/inference set, Q. So it should be a constant for all K.\nHe used lower-case pk here instead of Pk, but my understanding was that they were the same thing. May want to double check that.\n\nΨ is called the digamma function. Will need to look that one up."

(see below for details)\n\nIf it’s not a data quality, then is it concept drift or data drift?\n\nData Drift\n\nDistributions change but relationships between features remain\n\nConcept Drift\n\nDistributions might remain similar, but the relationships change instead: in between the features, or between the features and the model output.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhich features are drifting?\nHow strongly?\n\nMay require domain expert to determine whether there are substantial changes in associations\n\nWhat’s the process behind it?\n\nExamples\n\nA change in the socio-economic relations, such as inflation, diseases, or political changes;\nUnaccounted events, such as holidays, world cups, or even natural disasters;\nThe entrance of a new competitor in the market, and/or the shift of customers;\nChanges in the offered product, or the marketing campaign.\n\n\n\nActions\n\nData Pipeline: fix it\nData Drift:\n\nlow to moderate: leave it alone and see if the model handles it or gets worse\nhigh or meaningful: retraining the model should suffice\n\nConcept Drift: Model predictions should suffer, so a complete overhaul (EDA, algorithm selection, production tools, etc.) might be necessary.\nAdditional actions (may need if new labels/target variable data isn’t immediately available)\n\nTake the component of the application that uses the model offline (e.g remove recommendations for website)\nMake a human do what the model was doing (e.g. insurance claims processing, manufacturing quality control, or sales lead scoring)\nRule-based approach: You can often design a set of rules or heuristics that will be less precise but more robust than a rogue model. (e.g. simply show the most popular items to all customers)\nAdd business logic or an adjustment on top of the model output\n\nProbably won’t generalize well so should be context specific\n\n\n\nCode infrastructure\n\nWrong source - A pipeline points to an older version of the marketing table, or there is an unresolved version conflict.\nLost access - Someone moved the table to a new location but did not update the permissions.\nBroken queries - These JOINSs and SELECTs might work well until the first complication. Say, a user showed up from a different time zone and a new category of time zone is in the data. Some queries might not hold up.\nInfrastructure update - You got a new version of a database and some automated spring cleaning. Spaces replaced with underscores, all column names in lowercase. All looks fine until your model wants to calculate its regular feature as “Last month income/Total income” with hard-coded column titles.\n\nProcessing\n\nBroken feature code - For instance, the promo discounts were never more than 50% in training. Then marketing introduces a “free” offer and types 100% for the first time. Some dependent feature code suddenly makes no sense and returns negative numbers.\nDealing with outliers and missing values\n\nNotes from https://towardsdatascience.com/why-data-integrity-is-key-to-ml-monitoring-3843edd75cf5\nSkip the prediction or have a back-up system — If the data is bad, the serving system can skip the prediction to avoid erroring out or making an inaccurate prediction. While this can be a solution when the model makes a large number of non-critical decisions (e.g. product recommendation), it’s not an option when it makes business or life-critical decisions (e.g. healthcare). In those cases, there needs to be a backup decision-making system to ensure an outcome. However, these backup systems can further complicate the solution.\nImpute or predict missing values — A key challenge of this approach is that it hides the problems behind the data issue. Consistently replacing bad data can shift the expected feature’s distribution (aka data drift) causing the model to degrade. A drift as a result of this data replacement could be very difficult to catch, impacting the model’s performance slowly over time.\nSet default values — When the value is out of range, it can be replaced by a known high or low or unique value, e.g. replacing a very high or low age with the closest known minimum or maximum value. This can also cause gradual drift over time impacting performance.\nAcquire missing data — In some critical high value use cases like lending, ML teams also have the option to acquire the missing data to fill the gap. This is not typical for the vast majority of use cases.\nDo nothing — This is the simplest and likely the best approach to take depending on the criticality of your use case. It allows for bad data to surface upstream or downstream so that the problem behind it can be resolved. It’s likely that most inference engines might throw an error depending on the ML algorithm used to train the model. A prediction made on bad data can show up as an outlier of either the output or the impacted input helping surface the issue.\n\n\nData source\n\nnew data formats, types, and schemas\n\nAn update in the original business system leads to a change of unit of measurements (think Celsius to Fahrenheit) or dates formats (DD/MM/YY or MM/DD/YY?)\nNew product features in the application add the telemetry that the model never trained on.\nThere is a new 3rd party data provider or API, or an announced change in the format.\n\nThe website being scraped changes urls or webpage format\n\nHardware\n\nSensor breaks, Server goes down\nData collection can stop or the data that’s collected could be corrupted\n\nInput model\n\nA model’s results that are used as inputs to another model\nWould need to determine if it was model drift or data drift"

    "text": "56.6 Model Drift\n\nNotes from\n\nGetting a Grip on Data and Model Drift with Azure Machine Learning\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/why-data-integrity-is-key-to-ml-monitoring-3843edd75cf5\n\nTesting for drift\n\n\nOption 1: You’ll already have a trained candidate ready for deployment if model 2 outperforms model 1.\n\nExample: An aggregated dataset consists of 45,000 timestamped observations which we spilt into 20,000 references, 20,000 current, and 5,000 most recent observations for the test.\n\nScore Models\nThe current model outperforms the reference model by a large margin. Therefore, we can conclude that we indeed have identified model drift and that the current model is a promising candidate for replacing the production model.\n\n\nOption 2: Will likely reduce false positives, at the expense of being less sensitive to drift.\nOption 3: Reduces unnecessary training cycles in cases where no drift is identified.\n\nArchitectures\n\nAzure ML\n\n\nIngest and version data in Azure Machine Learning\n\nFor automation, we use Azure Machine Learning pipelines which consume managed datasets. By specifying the version parameter (version=“latest”) you can ensure to obtain the most recent data.\n\nTrain model\n\nModel is trained on the source data. This activity can also be part of an automated Azure Machine Learning pipeline.\nRecommend adding a few parameters like the dataset name and version to re-use the same pipeline object across multiple dataset versions.\n\nBy doing so, the same pipeline can be triggered in case model drift is present.\n\nOnce the training is finished, the model is registered in the Azure Machine Learning model registry.\n\nEvaluate model\n\nBesides looking at performance metrics to see how good a model is, a thorough evaluation also includes reviewing explanations, checking for bias and fairness issues, looking at where the model makes mistakes, etc. It will often include human verification.\n\nDeploy model - Deploy a specific version of the model\nMonitor model - Collect telemetry about the deployed model.\n\nAn Azure AppInsights workbook can be used to collect the number of requests made to the model instance as well as service availability and other user-defined metrics.\n\nCollect inference data and labels\n\nAs part of a continuous improvement of the service, all the inferences that are made by the model should be saved into a repository (e.g., Azure Data Lake) alongside the ground truth (if available).\n\nAllows us to figure out the amount of drift between the inference and the reference data.\n\nShould the ground truth labels not be available, we can monitor data drift but not model drift.\n\nMeasure data drift - Use the reference data and contrast it against the current data\nMeasure model drift - Determine if the model is affected by data or concept drift\nTrigger re-training\n\nIn case of model or concept drift, we can trigger a full re-training and deployment pipeline utilizing the same Azure ML pipeline we used for the initial training.\nRe-training triggers can either be:\n\nAutomatic — Comparing performance between the reference model and current model and automatically deploying if the current model performance is better than the reference model.\nHuman in the loop — Inspect data drift visualization alongside performance metrics between reference and current model and deploy with a data scientist/ model owner in the loop. This scenario would be suitable for highly regulated industries. This can be done using PowerApps, Azure DevOps pipelines, or GitHub Actions.\n\n\n\nNLP\n\nIssue\n\nAfter writing the new predictions with assigned labels (e.g. good/bad review) to a database., you typically do not get immediate feedback. There is no quick way to know if the predicted labels are correct. However, you do need something to keep tabs on the model’s performance to ensure it works as expected.\n\nOptions for collecting ground truth labels (reactive sol’ns, so there will be delay in awareness of drift)\n\nYou can have a feedback mechanism directly in the website UI. For example, you can allow the review authors or readers to report incorrectly assigned categories and suggest a better one. If you get a lot of reports or corrections, you can react to this and investigate.\nManual labeling as quality control. In the simplest form, the model creator can look at some of the model predictions to see if it behaves as expected. You can also engage external labelers from time to time to label a portion of the data. This way, you can directly evaluate the quality of the model predictions against expert-assigned labels.\n\nLead indicators of model drift are often data quality issues and changes in the input data distributions\n\nRegarding data quality, there might be corruption due to wrong encoding, the presence of special symbols, text in different languages, emojis, etc. being newly introduced into the data pipeline\nSee NLP Monitoring\n\n\n\nInvestigating\n\nAnalyze locally - For critical use cases the best practice is to begin with a fine grained approach of prediction analysis by replaying the inference with the issue and seeing its impact on the model.\n\nFor ML models, use model-agnostic diagnostic scores (e.g. shap, dalex, iml, etc.) to compare previous model prediction features to the drifted model prediction features.\n\nDefine the segments of low performance\n\nHave previously important features become not-so important. Is that a data issue or some outside event causing the change?\n\n\n\nAnalyze Globally - This involves analyzing the data for that feature over a broader range of time to see when the issue might have begun. Data changes typically coincide with product releases. So querying for data change timeline can tie the issue to a specific code and data release helping revert or address it quickly.\n\nImputing or other missing data methods may only gradually affect model results after a lengthy period and therefore may be difficult for data validation monitoring to detect."

The ground truth is still coming, but you are retraining your model using the old data, which may not represent the current reality well.\n\nFailure to determine the root cause of the problem\n\nIf the model’s performance drops, it doesn’t always mean that it needs more data. There could be various reasons for the model’s failure, such as changes in downstream business processes, training-serving skew, or data leakage. You should first investigate to find the underlying issue and then retrain the model if necessary.\n\nHigher risk of failure\n\nRetraining amplifies the risk of model failure. Besides the fact that it adds complexity to the infrastructure, the more frequently you update, the more opportunities the model has to fail. Any undetected problem appearing in the data collection or preprocessing will be propagated to the model, resulting in a retrained model on flawed data.\n\nHigher costs\n\nStoring and validating the retraining data\nCompute resources to retrain the model\nTesting a new model to determine if it performs better than the current one\n\n\nPerform an analysis on the data that caused the trigger\n\nDid the mean or sd (i.e. distribution) change?\nIs there a new seasonality or cyclic component present?\nAre there new correlations between variables?\nWhat’s behind the change (expansion into a different area, new product, new vendor, new competitor, etc.)\n\nUsing the characteristics of the data found in the analysis, decide on the most relevant block of data that is representative the current state of the data being collected. This is the retraining dataset\n\nA sufficient sample size should also be a consideration.\nMaybe use upsampling or simulation to obtain a sufficiently sized dataset with the necessary characteristics\n\nPotential next steps.

    "text": "57.6 Orchestration\n\n57.6.1 Airflow\n\nwebpage\nOpen-source platform for authoring, scheduling, and executing data pipelines.\n\nFeatures for managing and monitoring data pipelines, including integration with various data storage and processing technologies. Similar to the Unix cron utility — you write scripts and schedule them to run every X minutes.\nAirflow can be used for any sort of scheduling task, but is often used for scheduling data modeling. schedule, run and monitor the refresh of our data warehouse\nMonitoring on-prem checking Airflow logs is not user-friendly (better in AWS MWAA)\n\ndifferent types of logs for task, web server, scheduler, worker, and DAGs\nhave to SSH into the server and run commands which becomes more complicated when you want to use distributed servers for scalability.\n\nRequires you to create a central logging storage and make additional setup to make all servers write logs into that single place\n\n\nServer-based remains active even when not running jobs –&gt; continually incurring cost\n\nNo latency since servers are always running\n\nProblems\nLong feedback loop\n\nWhile programming, instant feedback of your DAG becomes crucial when you want a sanity check before your code goes too far.\nTo see the graph view, which is mainly for visualizing dependencies in DAGs, your code needs to be in the folder of an Airflow scheduler that can be picked up. The airflow scheduler also takes time to render and parse your DAG until it shows up.\nMakes debugging difficult during the development cycle, so some engineers write more lines of code and test them all together. If the lines of code become unmanageable on one screen, you might vaguely remember what to validate and what dependencies to check.\n\nDifficult with local development\n\na docker image can be used to inject as much production-related information as possible. But it’s still not 100% copy, and it takes tremendous effort to develop and maintain that docker image.\nEven if you set up dev, staging, and production environments for running Airflow, they aren’t totally isolated and developers can end-up interfering with one another.

It merely leverages a TSDB.\nBecause Prometheus scrapes values periodically, some Metric types (e.g., Gauges) can lose precision if the Metric value changes more frequently than the scraping interval. This problem does not apply to monotonically increasing metrics (e.g., Counters).\nMetrics can be logged with arbitrary identifiers such that at query time, users can filter Metrics by their identifier value.\nPromQL is flexible – users can compute many different aggregations (basic arithmetic functions) of Metric values over different window sizes, and these parameters can be specified at query time.\n\nMetric values (Docs):\n\nCounter: a cumulative Metric that monotonically increases. Can be used to track the number of predictions served, for example.\nGauge: a Metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily change. Can be used to track current memory usage, for example.\nHistogram: a Metric that categorizes observed numerical values into user-predefined buckets. This has a high server-side cost because the server calculates quantiles at query time.\nSummary: a Metric that tracks a user-predefined quantile over a sliding time window. This has a lower server-side cost because quantiles are configured and tracked at logging time. Also, the Summary Metric doesn’t generally support aggregations in queries.\n\nProcess\n\n\nUsers instrument their application code to log Metric values.\nThose values are scraped and stored in a Prometheus server.\nThe values can be queried using PromQL and exported to a visualization tool like Grafana\n\nThe are R packages that might make querying these metrics easier so you don’t have to learn PromQL"

These are people in the organization that are close to process and customers. We need to understand what are the potential drivers of lead time. Form a general equation that they help create.\n\n\nMeasure Drivers\n\nCollect Data\n\nCollect data related to the high level drivers. This data could be stored in databases or it may need to be collected. We could collect competitor data, supplier data, sales data (Enterprise Resource Planning or ERP data), personnel data, and more.\nMay require effort to set up processes to collect it, but developing strategic data sources becomes a competitive advantage over time.\n\nDevelop KPIs\n\nRequires knowledge of customers and industry. Realize that a wealth of data is available outside of your organization. Learn where this data resides, and it becomes a tremendous asset.\n\n\nUncover Problems And Opportunities\n\nEvaluate performance vs KPIs\nHighlight potential problem areas\nReview the our project for what could have been missed\n\nTalk with SME’s to make sure they agree with your findings so far.\n\n\nEncode Decision Making Algorithms\n\nDevelop algorithms to predict and explain the problem\nOptimize decisions to maximize profit\n\ne.g. For classification, threshold optimization using a custom cost function to optimize resources, costs, precision, and recall (See Diagnostics, Classification &gt;&gt; Scores &gt;&gt; Custom Cost Functions\n\nUse systematic decision-making algorithms to improve decision making\n\nExample: Employee Churn\n\n\nApp uses LIME to get prediction-level feature importance\n\n\nMeasure The Results\n\nCapture outcomes\nSynthesize results\nVisualize outcomes over time\n\nWe are looking for progress. If we have experienced good outcomes, then we need to recognize what contributed to those good outcomes.\nQuestions\n\nWere the decision makers using the tools?\nDid they follow the systematic recommendation?\nDid the model accurately predict risk?\nWere the results poor? Same questions apply.\n\n\n\nReport Financial Impact\n\nMeasure actual results\nTie to financial benefits\nReport financial benefit to key stakeholders\n\nIt’s insufficient to say that we saved 75 employees or 75 customers. Rather, we need to say that the average cost of a lost employee or lost customer is $100,000 per year, so we just saved the organization $7.5M/year. Always report as a financial value.\n\n\nExample: Customer Churn\n\nView business as a machine\n\nIsolating business units: The interaction occurs between Sales and the Customer\nDefining objectives: Make customers happy\nCollecting outcomes: We are slowly losing customers. It’s lowering revenue for the organization $500K per year.\n\nUnderstand The Drivers\n\nInvestigate if objectives are being met\n\nCustomer Satisfaction: Loss of customers generally indicates low satisfaction. This could be related to availability of products, poor customer service, or competition offering lower prices and/or better service or quality.\n\nSynthesize outcomes\n\nCustomers are leaving for a competitor. In speaking with Sales, several customers have stated “Competition has faster delivery”. This is an indicator that lead time, or the ability to quickly service customers, is not competitive.\n\nHypothesize Drivers\n\nLead time is related to supplier delivery, inventory availability, personnel, and the scheduling process.\n\n\nMeasure Drivers\n\nAverage Lead Time: The level is 2-weeks, which is based on customer feedback on competitors.\nSupplier Average Lead Time: The level is 3 weeks, which is based on feedback related to our competitor’s suppliers.\nInventory Availability Percentage: The level of 90% is related based on where customers are experiencing unmet demand. This data comes from the ERP data comparing sale requests to product availability.\nPersonnel Turnover: The level of 15% is based on the industry averages.\n\nUncover Problems and Opportunities\n\nOur average lead time is 6 weeks compared to the competitor average lead time of 2 weeks, which is the first order cause for the customer churn\nOur supplier average lead time is on par with our competitor’s, which does not necessitate a concern.\nOur inventory percentage availability is 80%, which is too low to maintain a high customer satisfaction level. This could be a reason that churn is increasing.\nOur personnel turnover in key areas is zero over the past 12 months, so no cause for concern."

Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.\n\nAfter reading a user story, the team knows why they are building, what they’re building, and what value it creates.\n\n\n\n\n58.4.3 Potential Agile values for data analysis\n\nDecisions over dashboards: By focusing on what people want to do with data, we can move past the first set of questions they ask, focus on the valuable iteration and follow-up questions, build trust, cultivate curiosity and drive action.\nFunctional analysis over perfect outputs: To enable quick iterations, we’re going to have to spend less time crafting perfect outputs and focus on moving from one question to the next as quickly as possible.\nSharing data over gatekeeping data: We’re going to have to share responsibility for our data and data “products” with our business partners. This will help build trust, and keep us all accountable for cultivating great data products and data-driven cultures.\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools: When in doubt, we need to rely on the relationships we’ve built with the business over the tools we’ve put in to help guide those relationships.\n\n\n\n58.4.4 Data Science Lifecycle\n\n\narticle\nIf at any point we are not satisfied with our results or faced with changing requirements we can return to a previous step since this methodology is focused on iterative development\nSteps\n\nBusiness Understanding\n\nDefine objectives: Work with customers/stakeholders to identify the business problem we are trying to solve.\nIdentify data sources: Identify the data sources that we will need to solve it.\n\nData Acquisition and Understanding\n\nIngest the data: Bring the data into our environment that we are using for analytics.\nExplore the data: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and determinine if it is adequate for model development.\nSet up a data pipeline: Build a process to ingest new data. A data pipeline can either be batch-based, real-time or a hybrid of the previous options.\nNote: While the data scientists on the team are working on EDA, the data engineers may be working on setting up a data pipeline, which allows us to complete this stage quicker\n\nModeling\n\nFeature engineering: Creat data features from raw data for model training.\n\nEnhanced by having a good understanding of the data.\n\nModel training: Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Train models\nModel evaluation: Evaluate those models by answering the following questions:\n\nWhat are the metrics that the model achieves on the validation/testing set?\nDoes the model solve the business problem and fit the constraints of the problem?\nIs this model suitable for production?\n\nNote: Could train one model and find that the results are not satisfactory and return to the feature engineering and model training stages to craft better features and try different modeling approaches.\n\nDeployment (Options)\n\nExposing the model through an API that can be consumed by other applications.\nCreating a microservice or containerized application that runs the model.\nIntegrating the model into a web application with a dashboard that displays the results of the predictions.\nCreating a batch process that runs the model and writes the predictions to a data source that can be consumed.\n\nStakeholder/customer acceptance\n\nSystem validation: Confirm that the data pipeline, model, and deployment satisfy the business use case and meet the needs of the customers.\nProject hand-off: Transfer the project to the group that will manage it in production. l\n\n\n\n\n\n58.4.5 Product Roadmap examples\n\nExample\n\nInitiative: build a forecast system to predict sales for an ice cream company\nEpics:\n\n“As a Sales Manager, I need to understand which regions I need to focus my outbound effort based on the sales forecast”\n“As a Logistics Manager, I need to estimate demand so that I can prepare our production accordingly”\n\nUser Story:\n\n“As a Logistics Manager, I need to see the forecast on my Production Dashboard”;\n“As a Logistics Manager, I need to have simulations around how weather predictions can change the forecast”;\n\n\n\n\n\n58.4.6 Sprint Workflow\n\n\nBad flow chart, should be a circle where review loops back to planning\nsprint review - the scrum team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the sprint, what has changed in their environment, and collaborate on what to do next\n\nThese are necessary to avoiding issues that might destroy a project. (see below)\n\nData scientist participation will help with their communication skills and increase transparency in what they’re doing\nStakeholders might think a feature or ML result is feasible with the current data and tech stack. These are important to opportunities to explain why they aren’t feasible.\nRoles often bleed together. The planning portion is a good way to converge on a strategy of what to do next.\n\n\nsprint planning (~15 minutes every two weeks)\n\nDevelop the next sprint’s goals\n\nDo the next sprint’s goals align with our goals in 3 months\nDo the next sprint’s goals align with our annual team goals/strategic vision\nRevise the next sprint’s goals to align with these goals if necessary\n\nBreak the sprint goals into tasks and sub tasks\nAssign the tasks/subtasks to members and estimate time to completion of these tasks\nExtended sprint planning (Every 3 months to roughly plan the next 3 months)\nStrategic meetings (6 months)\n\nSome technical details to starting a project\n\nNotes from The Technical Blockers to Turning Data Science Teams Agile\nStart a repo\n\nin the organization acct not under a personal acct\nuse readme as onboarding document\n\nlast person to join is in-charge of it\n\nThe last person will be best suited to edit/add details that clear up any confusion that they had when they were onboarded\nInclude “This document is maintained by the most recent person to join the team. That person is currently: ____”\n\nExplicitly state that anyone can review code in your README. If someone isn’t familiar with a part of the code, they become so by reviewing it.\n\nEdit the settings of your repo. Make the main branch protected, don’t allow anyone to push directly to the main branch, and only allow PRs that have passed unit-tests (more about this later) and have undergone a code review.\n\nUpdate the team’s skills related to Agile\n\nIn the beginning, may not have a lot of tasks to assign as there may be design/requirements discussions\nMake sure everyone knows git and how to write unit tests\n\nCheck team members’ personal accts to see how many commits they have, “https://github.com/search?q=author:”\nCheck team members’ projects for unit tests\nIf it doesn’t look like they don’t have much experience, assign a udemy, etc. course on the subject and require a certificate in order to be assigned tasks\n\n\nAssign tasks through Agile tools like ZenHub, Jira, or Trello\nSet-up a CI tool\n\nexamples: Github Actions, TravisCI, CircleCI, or Jenkins\nadd learning this tool as part of your ZenHub task boards and don’t allow people to move on until they’ve learned it.\nrun your unit tests every time someone makes a PR\n\nDaily Stand-ups\n\nused to discuss what your daily work will be, and it should be short\nProject strategy meeting should be immediately after the stand-up\nEach team member answers only 3 questions:\n\nWhat will you do today?\nWhat did you do yesterday?\n\nRather than a simple verbal status update. It can be better the show what you did.\n\ne.g. show your coding screen and walk everyone through you code\n\nBenefits\n\nSomeone else on the team will have an idea for a better, faster, or simpler way to solve the problem\nEasier to catch a flaw after a few lines of code than after 1000 during a code review\nIf you find out that someone on my team is doing something very similar, and you can save time by reusing code.\nCool to see incremental progress every day instead of just the final product\n\n\nWhat are you blocked by?\nScreen-share these three questions written out on a PowerPoint slide. \n\nCongratulate people on finishing the courses\nAssign a weekly changing role of scrum master\n\nThe scrum master makes sure the 3 questions above are answered by everyone.\nThis person doesn’t have to be the boss or most senior person."

This helps familiarize them with the company KPIs and promotes dashboard adoption.\n\n\n\nDeprecation Process\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from Why and How to Deprecate Dashboards\n\nExample contains py code for Looker SDK\n\nDashboard bloat  is the effect on an organization when time is wasted finding the relevant visual to answer a question or recreating visuals that already exist.\n\n\n\nWrite a script to dump all BI metadata into the warehouse\n\nGet data through SDKs/APIs (e.g. {{looker_sdk}}, {{Domo}}) or APIs (e.g. Tableau Server, PowerBI)\n\nExamples\n\nLooker: fetch all dashboards, looks, and users\nTableau: fetch workbooks, views, and users\n\nClean the response by either casting it as a JSON or extracting only specific fields of relevance (like ID, name, created date, user)\n\nGet last access date for each visual\n\nLooker (i__looker metadata) and PowerBI (raw audit logs), or pre-built reports with Tableau and Domo\nAlso other usage data if available\n\nWrite all these outputs into warehouse tables\n\nOverwrite tables with data dumps (like all visuals), and append data that builds over time (like historical access)\nExample: Looker\n\nTables for each visual (dashboards and looks for the Looker example). Call it `looker_dashboard` and `looker_look`\nTable of users. Call it `looker_user`\nTable of historical access (either raw or aggregated to latest access date per visual). Call it `looker_historical_access`\n\n\nSet script to run on a schedule (preferrably daily)\n\n\n\nQuery table to summarize ownership and last access date for each visual\n\nSometimes, creating the visual doesn’t count as accessing it, so you’ll need to make sure recently created visuals aren’t flagged for deletion.\nTo alert users via Slack, you’ll need to map their email to a Slack username.\nIf it’s a table not a view, update this on a schedule.\nCan be a dbt model\nExample\nwith history as (\n    select visual_id,\n          max(access_date) as latest_access_date\n    from looker_historical_access\n    group by visual_id\n), dashboards as (\n    select\n        id as visual_id,\n        name as visual_name,\n        user_id as visual_created_user_id,\n        created_at as visual_created_at,\n        'dashboard' as type\n    from dashboard\n), looks as (\n    select\n        id as visual_id,\n        name as visual_name,\n        user_id as visual_created_user_id,\n        created_at as visual_created_at,\n        'look' as type\n    from look\n), visuals as(\n    select * from dashboards union all select * from looks\n)\nselect\n    v.*,\n    coalesce(h.latest_access_date, v.visual_created_at) as latest_access_date,\n    u.email\nfrom visuals as v\nleft join history as h on h.visual_id = \nleft join user as u on v.visual_created_user_id;\n\nResult: one row per visual, when it was created, the user who created it, and the last date it was viewed or edited\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically warn users before deprecation, then delete visuals\n\n60 or 90 days as the threshold for “not recent” is recommended\nProcess\n\nCommunicate the reason for deprecating visuals\n\nDocument and communicate the benefits of keeping a clean BI instance to the broader organization\nThe purpose is not to delete others’ work; it’s to enable everyone in the company to get insights from data faster.\nSee “Dashboard Bloat” above\n\nCreate a deprecation Slack channel for automated communication\n\nAnyone who is a user of the BI tool should be added to this channel.\n\nGive people a week to save the dashboard/visual\n\nQuery visuals that haven’t been accessed in X-7 days and send a Slack message.\ne.g. Visuals included should be ones unused for 53 days if deleting at 60 days of idle time, or 83 days if deleting at 90 days of idle time.\nExample\n# Everything below is pseudo-code, with utility methods abstracted away\ndeprecation_days = 60\nwarn_visuals = get_warehouse_data( # Pseudo method\n    f'''\n    select visual_name, created_by_user\n    from modeled_looker_data\n    where current_date - last_accessed_date = {deprecation_days - 7}\n    ''')\nslack_message_template = '''\n    Visual {{visual_name}} created by @{{slack_username}} will be\n    deprecated in 7 days. If this is incorrect, please contact the\n    analytics team.\n'''\nfor visual in warn_visuals:\n    send_slack_message(slack_message_template, visual) # Pseudo method\n\nQuery visuals that are ready for deletion and delete them programatically\ndeprecation_days = 60\ndelete_visuals = get_warehouse_data( # Pseudo method\n    f'''\n    select visual_id\n    from modeled_looker_data\n    where current_date - last_accessed_date &gt;= {deprecation_days}\n    ''')\nfor visual in delete_visuals:\n    visual_id = visual['visual_id']\n    if visual['type'] == 'look':\n        sdk.delete_look(visual_id)\n    else:\n        sdk.delete_dashboard(visual_id)\n\nTrial period: Run the automated process for a few weeks by commenting out the actual deletion to ensure the logic is sound.\nShould also be aware of data collection or dbt models that are used for the visual being deprecated. If they aren’t attached to anything else, they can be deleted, too."

    "section": "59.2 General Steps for Starting a Project",
    "text": "59.2 General Steps for Starting a Project\n\nFraming a data question\n\nGuidelines\n\nPrecision: Be as detailed as possible in how you frame your questions. Avoid generic words like ‘improve’ or ‘success.’ If you want to improve something, specify by how much. If you want to achieve something, specify by when.\n\nDecide before starting what the minimum project performance is to productionize (i.e. build a fully functional project) and launch (i.e. deliver to all your customers)\n\nSetting these thresholds at the beginning will help to prevent you from bargaining with yourself or stakeholders to deliver the project that might harm your business\n\nAfter working hard on a project and pouring resources into it, it can be difficult to end it.\n\n\n\nData-Centric: Consider the role of data in your organization. Can data help you answer this question? Is it clear what data you will need to collect to answer this question? Can progress on the task be codified into a metric that can be measured? If the answer to any of these questions is ambiguous or negative, investing in additional data resources may be an inefficient allocation of resources.\n\nExample\n\nFigure Out What Data You Need\n\nGuidelines\n\nNecessity: Are the data you are collecting necessary? Avoid data bloat, which is over-collecting data points for a “just in case” scenario. This makes sustaining long-term data collection of those fields far more burdensome.\nAvailability: Are there external, publicly available data sources like government data that you can leverage? If the data needs to be collected, how easy is it to collect? If it is hard to collect, do you have a plan and resources in place as to how you can ensure it is collected at regular intervals over time? One-off data collection is rarely helpful as there is no reference point to measure the impact of interventions over time.\nMaintainability: Can you maintain and easily update this data over time? Is the cost of doing so sustainable? This is critical because longitudinal data collection with standard fields is one of the most valuable resources for a nonprofit. Avoid constantly changing field names, a moving target of data collection objectives, and costly data collection procedures (like purchasing third-party data) that are not sustainable given your overall budget.\nReliability: If you are using a third party data source, do you trust the quality of the data? What are the ways this data may be biased, incomplete, or inaccurate?\n\nExample\n\nA nonprofit with a mission to find long-term housing for the unhoused. This organization may want to answer the question: ’what percentage of the unhoused have we been able to successfully rehabilitate in the area we serve?’\n\n\nOrganizational Buy-in\n\nProject manager tries to examine whether the project can fundamentally be classified as feasible and whether the requirements can be carried out with the available resources.\n\nExpert Interviews: Is the problem in general is very well suited for the deployment of data science and are there corresponding projects that have already been undertaken externally and also published?\nData science team: Are there a sufficient number of potentially suitable methods for this project and are the required data sources are available?\nIT department: check the available infrastructure and the expertise of the involved employees.\n\nMake sure everyone on the team agrees on what data that you want to collect and measure and who owns the data collection process.\nHaving someone of authority or that’s respected in each department involved in the development of the product will go a long way to building trust with users when it’s fully deployed\n\nExample: Demand Forecasting Automation\n\nTeam should consist of Supply Chain department and close collaboration with Sales and IT\n\n\nExample\n\nSuppose teachers at a school are interested in fielding quantitative surveys to track student outcomes, but there exists little incentive for teachers to collect this data on top of regular work. As a result, only one teacher in the school volunteers to design and administer the survey to their class. However, the survey results will now be limited to the students’ experiences and outcomes for just the one class. The measured outcomes will be biased because they will not capture any variance across students from different classes in the school.\n\n\nCalculate How Much Data You Need to Collect\nMake sure you’ve answered these questions\n\nIs the problem definition clear and specific? Are there measurable criteria that define success or failure?\nIs it technically feasible to address the defined problem within the designated timeframe? Is the data required for the envisioned solution approach available?\nDo all relevant stakeholders agree with the problem definition, performance indicators, and selection criteria?\nDoes the intended technical solution resolve the initial business problem?"

actually use the tools or insights you’ll be delivering\nA facilitator (probably you) and a few members of your data science or analytics team\n\nChallenge Identification Workshop\n\nSuited for a situation when the business stakeholders know what their challenges are, but don’t know what you can do for them.\nGoals:\n\nDS: Try to understand the customer pain points as well as you can.\n\nDo not try to develop solutions in this workshop\n\nStakeholders: get as many ideas out as possible in the time allotted.\n\nAdditional Supplies\n\nPoster or slide with user journey, or something similar, depending on the business\n\nHelps to guide participants to home-in on customer pain points\nNeeds to be done before the workshop\nExample\n\n\nProcess\n\nIntroduction\n\nBrief introduction of your team\nBrief 5-minute ‘Best In Class’ slide or two where I look at companies who are currently doing amazing things, preferably in the data science domain, in the area that our stakeholders work\nAddress goal of the workshop (see above for stakeholders)\n\nSplit into two or three groups\n\nIdeally between four to five people per group\nPut senior managers or executives in separate groups\n1 DS or analyst in each group\n\nWrite as many customer pain points as possible (aka Ideation)\n\nDuration: 25–30 minutes\nEverybody writes ideas on sticky note and puts on their board\n\nNo need for whole group to approve of the idea.\n\n“Bad” ideas are weeded out later\n\n\nIf you see themes popping up, go ahead and group similar sticky-notes together\nDS or analyst needs to pay attention to each proposed idea, so as to be able to write a fuller description of the idea later on\n\nIf possible, note the author of each idea so as to be able to ask them questions later if needed.\n\n(You) Walk around to each group\n\nRemind them of the rules (get down as many ideas as possible)\nPrompt them with questions to get more ideation happening within the groups\n\n\nOne member from each of the groups presents their group’s key ideas back to the rest of the room\n\nDuration: 3-5 min per group\n\nPlace similar stickies into groups or themes\nVote on the best ideas\n\nDuration: 3 min\nEveryone gets three dot stickers and is allowed to vote for any ideas\nThey can put all their stickies on one idea or divide them up however they like\nNo discussions\nIf it’s the case that one sticky within a theme of stickies gets all the votes, or even if the votes are all shared equally, consider all of those as votes towards the theme.\n\n\n\nPredefined Problem Sculpting Workshop\n\nThe difference between this approach and the first one is that here the business stakeholders already have an idea about what they need.\n\ne.g a metric of some sort, some kind of customer segmentation or some kind of tool\n\nExample\n\nDevelop ‘affluency score’ for each banking customer.\n\nGoal: Answer 2 questions\n\nWhat is it that we’re trying to do?\n\nDefining what it is you’re trying to do will help to define what is meant by the metric/segment/measure you’re developing.\nFrom example (see Goal above), it’s vital that everyone in the room understands what is meant by “affluence.”\n\nDoes it mean:\n\nhow much money someone currently has?\nIt is a measure of their potential spend?\nDoes it refer to their lifestyle and how much debt they may take on and can realistically pay?\n\n\n\nWhy do we want to do this?\n\nThe answer to why has design implications\nExamples\n\nIs it something we’ll use to set strategic goals?\nDo we want to use it to identify cross or upsell opportunities?\n\n\n\nAdditional Supplies:\n\nPoster or slide with these 2 questions\n\nProcess\n\nIntroduction\n\nBrief introduction of your team\nAddress goals of the workshop\n\nSplit into two or three groups\n\nIdeally between four to five people per group\nPut senior managers or executives in separate groups\n1 DS or analyst in each group\n\nHave groups answer the “What” question\n\nDuration: 15 min\n\nFeedback session with whole workshop\n\nDuration: 3 min\nGroup answers are presented and discussed\n\nHave groups answer the “Why” question\n\nDuration: 15 min\n\nFeedback session with whole workshop\n\nDuration: 3 min\nGroup answers are presented and discussed\n\n\nCompare and address gaps\n\nDuration: 4 min\nCompare all group answers against the current solution\n\ne.g. does the current metric represent these answers to “what” and “why”?\n\nIf there are gaps between the group answers and the current solution, try to figure out how best the fill those gaps.\n\n\nPost-Workshop Debrief\n\nShould occur the same day as the workshop\nDocument sticky notes and key ideas\n\nThe data scientists/analysts embedded in the groups should be able to expand on the ideas on the sticky notes\nIf the author of the idea was recorded, that should be included as well\n\nAs you’re starting to think of solutions to the pain points you discussed, reach out to authors/stakeholders to get their opinions on your thoughts and to understand where you might be able to get the data from.\n\n\nHave data team ideate on solutions to these painpoints, etc."

Related to qualitative factors and potential risks, we can conclude that if the project is back up by an influential group of leaders, then the positive aspects exceed the negative ones. On the balance, we would advise a GO decision for this project.”\n\n\n\nExecutive Presentation\n\nThe conclusion should be short, precise, and convincing format\nCrucial to persuade key stakeholders to invest in your project\nUse a good action title, writing down the most relevant requirements of your project, use a chart to visualize your results, and have some key takeaways on the bottom with a recommendation.\n\nProposal\n\nSections 1-3 should be put into a concise executive summary\nTell a story\n\nEvery item should be consistent with every other part\n\ne.g. a deliverable shouldn’t be mentioned if it’s not part of solving the issue in the problem statement\n\nShould flow from more abstract ideas to more and more detail\n\nFormat\n\nProblem Statement\n\nPaint a bleak picture and explain how the problem could’ve been overcome if your project were in production when the problem occurred\nList examples where risk and costs occurred, opportunities were missed, etc. and how your project would’ve prevented or taken advantage of these things if it had been in production\n\nskill upgrades or efficiency gains are NOT good answers\n\n\nVision\n\nTies your project to the companies long range strategy\n\nBenefits\n\ndetails  about the specific new capabilities provided or costs avoided\nneed to be quantifiable\n\nDeliverables\n\ndetails about other non-primary benefits\n\nSuccess Criteria\n\nCharacteristics\n\nspecific, measurable, bounded by a time period, realistic\n\n\nThe plan\n\noverview of the steps the project will take\n\nincludes deadlines, waterfall or agile approach, etc.\n\n\nCost/Budget\n\n\nTerms\n\nCost/Investment\n\nFixed\n\nPersonnel salaries\n\nIf you’re using outside data consultants, Glassdoor has average salaries, https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,13.htm\n\nexample: ~$100K each\n\n\nAdditional investments could be access to external data sources, research, and software licenses\n\nTableau can cost around $48K per year\n\nTraining for any additional or current personnel on tools or subject matter\n\nworkshops, online learning\ntax-reclamation example: ~$12K total\n\n\nVariable\n\nCloud storage\n\ntax-reclamation example: AWS (pay-as-you-go) $75K-$95K per year\n\n\n\nTax rate\n\ntax-reclamation example: 28%\n\nRevenue\n\nForecasts of revenue\n\nCorrection Factors\n\nExplains the difference between profit after tax and cashflow\ne.g. depreciation of investment, changing working capital, investment, change in financing or borrowing\n\ncost of sales = (revenue*some%) - 1\n\nrefers to what the seller has to pay in order to create the product and get it into the hands of a paying customer.\n\nMaybe this is a catch-all for anything else not covered in the Cost/Investment section\n\naka cost of revenue (sales/service) or cost of goods (manufacturing)\n30% used in example\nBegins after year 1\n\ndepreciation per year = (investment - salvage_value)/(num_years - 1)\n\nFor an datascience project, the salvage_value is 0 most of the time.\ndepreciation value is listed for each year after the first year of the project\ngets subtracted from revenue in calculation of profit_before_tax calculation\ngets added to profit_after_tax in cashflow equation\n\nChange in working capital = (expected_yearly_revenue/365) * customer_credit_period\n\ncustomer_credit_period (days): number of days that a customer is allowed to wait before paying an invoice. The concept is important because it indicates the amount of working capital that a business is willing to invest in its accounts receivable in order to generate sales.\n\n60 days used in example\n\nOnly a cost in the 1st yr and then it is recouped in the last year (somehow)\n\nsounds like this whole thing is just an accounting procedure\n\nDunno how this relates to a datascience project\n\n\n\nCost of Capital (also see discount rate/hurdle rate, cost of capital in Business Algorithms note)\n\nUsed to characterize risk here. Think 5-10% is used for back-of-the-envelope calculations.\n\ntax-reclamation example: 8.3%\n\nAlso see\n\nAlgorithms, Product &gt;&gt; Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) &gt;&gt; Internal Rate of Return\nMorgan Stanley’s Guide to Cost of Capital (Also in R &gt;&gt; Documents &gt;&gt; Business)\n\nThread about the guide\n\n\ncost of capital typically calculated as Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n\nWACC = w1*cost_of_equity + w2*cost_of_debt\n\nw1, w2 depend on the company’s capital structure (e.g. 70% equity, 30% debt)\nCAPM = Rf + β (Rm - Rf)\n\ncost_of_equity approximated using capital asset pricing model (CAPM)\nRf = risk-free rate of return\nRm = market rate of return\nβ = risk estimate or a company’s stock beta or a similar public company’s stock beta\n\ncost_of_debt = (interest_expense / total_debt) * (1 - T)\n\ninterest_expense = interest paid on company’s current debt\n\nSince interest expense is tax-deductible, the debt is calculated on an after-tax basis\n\nT = company’s marginal tax rate\n\n\n\nAs of January 2019, transportation in railroads has the highest cost of capital at 11.17%. The lowest cost of capital can be claimed by non-bank and insurance financial services companies at 2.79%.\nHigh CoCs - Biotech and pharmaceutical drug companies, steel manufacturers, Internet (software) companies, and integrated oil and gas companies. Those industries tend to require significant capital investment in research, development, equipment, and factories.\nLow CoCs - Money center banks, power companies, real estate investment trusts (REITs), retail grocery and food companies, and utilities (both general and water). Such companies may require less equipment or benefit from very steady cash flows.\n\nNet Present Value (NPV)\n\nUses cashflow (excludes year 1) and cost of capital as inputs\n\nExcel has some sort of NPV wizard that does the calculation (see tidyquant for npv function)\nExample in article provided link to his googlesheet so the formula is there or maybe googlesheets has a wizard too.\n\n\nInternal Rate of Return (IRR)\n\nIt’s the value that the cost of capital (aka discount rate) would have to be for NPV and cost to zero out each other.\nThe interest rate at which a company borrows against itself as a proxy for opportunity cost. Typically, large and/or public organizations have a budgetary IRR of 10% to 15% depending on the industry and financial situation.\nHigher is better\nInvestopedia has an easy formula\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp\n\n\nQualitative Factors\n\nOther things that have value but are difficult to quantify. Might change a quantitatively negative value project into a positive value project\n\nUses columns negative, positive, impact\n\nnegative and positive are indicators\nimpact has values low, medium, and high\n\n\nExamples\n\nProject has flexibility (+) (calculated using real options analysis(?))\nStrategic Fit (+) - supports strategy of the company (?)\n\nincreases trust with public\nmarketing boosted because they can use buzzwords like “AI” or “data-driven” in ads\n\nIncreases competency (+) - may help the company down the road\n\nmore agile, data-driven, familiarity with newer technologies\n\nred tape or bureaucracy or politics causing delays (-)\nImplementation (-)\n\ncan be a negative, if the leadership that’s needed is tied up with other projects\nChallenges"

(e.g. cookies on your website) - If metric measured from new data is potentially valuable, build a simple, less robust (without sacrificing too much data integrity) pipeline to your lake. - Meaning fewer built-in quality checks - Doing it this way does add technical debt - If metric feeds into a company-wide metric, then additional checks will need to be added - E.g. no duplicate datasets, data corruption, or data losses. - After 6 months or so, if metric remains useful, make pipeline more robust. - Adding third party data pipeline (e.g. Equifax) - E.g. demographic, income data - If a product has a certain demographics associated with it, this data can be used to weight customers relative to the demographic specifics of that product. - Get a sample first to determine if it’s worth it - 3rd party data is expensive to buy and usually a reoccurring cost. - Can be time-consuming and resource intensive to add the pipeline - Get transparency on how the data was collected and validity checks used - Periodically reevaluate whether the metrics fundamentally still make sense from a business perspective and how they can be improved. - Expand pipelines to capture additional data in order to continue to refine metrics - Drop and add metrics as business and trends change. - Redefine metrics as needed -"

But when you go into specifics like formats (xml, json, html), you could override a generate_report method in the subclass.\n\n\nEncapsulation\n\nWhen you want to separate external and internal interfaces in order to (ostensibly) hide internal code from the user.\nKeeps excess complexity from the user\n\n\nUse camel case for class names\nUse snake case for methods and attributes\nAlways use self as the first argument of a method\nWrite docstrings for your classes so that your code is more understandable to potential collaborators and future you.\nCreate a Class that allows method chaining\n\n\nreturn self is what allows the chaining to happen"

    "text": "Inheritance\n\n\nSome notes from this much more detailed example (article)\n\nShows how to combine different scripts  (aka modules) and diagram the hierarchies\nSome good debugging too\n\nRunning &lt;class&gt;.__mro__will show you the order of inheritance.\n\n\nInheritance models what is called an “is a” relationship. This means that when you have a Derived (aka subclass, child) class that inherits from a Base (aka super, parent) class, you created a relationship where Derived is a specialized version of Base.\nChild classes inherit all of their parent’s attributes and methods, but they can also define their own attributes and methods.\nCan override or extend parent class attributes and methods\nclass Manager(Employee):\n    pass\n\nm1 = Manager(\"aaa\", 13000)\n\nManager is the child class and Employee is the parent class (see top)\nChild classes don’t require a constructor method for an object to be created\n\nExtending the instance attributes of the parent class\nclass Manager(Employee):\n    def __init__(self, name, salary=0, department):\n        Employee.__init__(self, name, salary=0)\n        self.department = department\n\nContructor method for the child class with the new attribute, “department,” in the arguments.\nParent class (Employee) constructor method is called and a new attribute, department, is defined.\n\n\n\nsuper()\n\nAlternative way of extending instance attributes through inheritance\nExample\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, length, width):\n        self.length = length\n        self.width = width\n    def area(self):\n        return self.length * self.width\n    def perimeter(self):\n        return 2 * self.length + 2 * self.width\nclass Square(Rectangle):\n    def __init__(self, length):\n        super().__init__(length, length)\nclass Cube(Square):\n    def surface_area(self):\n        face_area = super().area()\n        return face_area * 6\n    def volume(self):\n        face_area = super().area()\n        return face_area * self.length\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cube = Cube(3)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cube.surface_area()\n54\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cube.volume()\n27\n\nClass Cube inherits from Square and extends the functionality of .area() (inherited from the Rectangle class through Square) to calculate the surface area and volume of a Cube instance Also notice that the Cube class definition does not have an .__init__(). Because Cube inherits from Square and .__init__() doesn’t really do anything differently for Cube than it already does for Square, you can skip defining it, and the .__init__() of the other child class (Square) will be called automatically.\nsuper(Square, self).__init__(length, length) is equivalent to calling super without parameters (see above example)\nUsing super(Square, self).area() in class Cube. Setting the 1st parameter to Square instead of Cube causes super() to start searching for a matching method (in this case, .area()) at one level above Square in the instance hierarchy, in this case Rectangle.\n\nIf Square had an .area method, but you wanted to use Rectangle’s instead, this would be a way to do that.\n\nNote another difference between using super() and using the class name (e.g. the first example) — “self” is NOT one of the args in super()\nExample: Child class of two separate hierarchies\n# Super class\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, length, width, **kwargs):\n        self.length = length\n        self.width = width\n        super().__init__(**kwargs)\n    def area(self):\n        return self.length * self.width\n    def perimeter(self):\n        return 2 * self.length + 2 * self.width\n# Child class: Square class inherits from the Rectangle class\nclass Square(Rectangle):\n    def __init__(self, length, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(length=length, width=length, **kwargs)\n# Child class: Cube class inherits from Square and also from Rectangle classes\nclass Cube(Square):\n    def surface_area(self):\n        face_area = super().area()\n        return face_area * 6\n    def volume(self):\n        face_area = super().area()\n        return face_area * self.length\n\n# Class (separate)\nclass Triangle: \n    def __init__(self, base, height, **kwargs): \n        self.base = base \n        self.height = height \n        super().__init__(**kwargs) \n    def tri_area(self): \n        return 0.5 * self.base * self.height\n\n# Inherits from a child class (and super class) and a class\nclass RightPyramid(Square, Triangle):\n    def __init__(self, base, slant_height, **kwargs):\n        self.base = base\n        self.slant_height = slant_height\n        kwargs[\"height\"] = slant_height\n        kwargs[\"length\"] = base\n        super().__init__(base=base, **kwargs)\n    def area(self):\n        base_area = super().area()\n        perimeter = super().perimeter()\n        return 0.5 * perimeter * self.slant_height + base_area\n    def area_2(self):\n        base_area = super().area()\n        triangle_area = super().tri_area()\n        return triangle_area * 4 + base_area\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pyramid = RightPyramid(base=2, slant_height=4)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pyramid.area()\n20.0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pyramid.area_2()\n20.0\n\nRightPyramid inherits from a child class (Square) and a class Triangle\n\nSince Square inherits from Rectangle, so does RightPyramid\nTriangle is a separate class not part of any hierarchy\n\nIf there’s an .area method in either of the classes, then super will search hierarchy of the class listed first (Square), then the hierarchy of the class listed second (Triangle)\n\nBest practice to make sure each class has different method names.\n\nEach class with an __init__ constructor gets a super().__init__() and **kwargs added to its args\n\nWhich is every class sans Cube. If Cube was inherited by a class, I think it would require an __init__ constructor and the super().__init__(**kwargs) expression.\nWithout doing this, calling .area_2() in RightPyramid will give us an AttributeError since .base and .height don’t have any values. (don’t completely understand this explanation)\n\nkwarg flow through super().__init__()\n\nIn RightPyramid __init__,  slant_height and base values are assigned to height and length keys in the kwargs dict\nsuper() passes base and the kwargs dict up to Square and Triangle\n\nTriangle uses height from kwargs and base\nSquare uses length from kwargs\n\nSquare passes length to Rectangle as values for both width and length\n\n\nAll classes now have the argument values necessary for their functions to work.\n\nNow RightPyramid can call those other classes’ methods (e.g. .area and .perimeter from Rectangle and tri_area from Triangle)\n\nI believe since every class has **kwargs arg in their super().__init__, each has every value in the kwarg dict even if they don’t need it.\n\nSo probably possible to add functions to those classes that would use those values\n\n\n\nExample: Using super with method other than __init__\nclass SalaryPolicy: \n    def __init__(self, weekly_salary): \n        self.weekly_salary = weekly_salary \n    def calculate_payroll(self): \n        return self.weekly_salary\n\nclass CommissionPolicy(SalaryPolicy): \n    def __init__(self, weekly_salary, commission): \n        super().__init__(weekly_salary) \n        self.commission = commission \n    def calculate_payroll(self): \n        fixed = super().calculate_payroll() \n        return fixed + self.commission\n\nIn CommissionPolicy’s calculate_payroll, super() accesses SalaryPolicy’s calculate_payroll method to get the weekly_salary value\n\n\n\n\n\nDiamond Problem\n\n\nAppears when you’re using multiple inheritance and deriving from two classes that have a common base class.\n\nThis can cause the wrong version of a method to be called.\ne.g. TemporarySecretary uses multiple inheritance to derive from two classes that ultimately also derive from Employee. This causes two paths to reach the Employee base class, which is something you want to avoid in your designs.\n\n\n\n\nMixin Class\n\nOperates the same as Inheritance, but since it only provides simple behavior(s), it is easy to reuse with other classes without causing problems\nExample: Take certain class attributes and create a dict\n# In representations.py\nclass AsDictionaryMixin:\n    def to_dict(self):\n        return {\n            prop: self._represent(value)\n            for prop, value in self.__dict__.items()\n            if not self._is_internal(prop)\n        }\n    def _represent(self, value):\n        if isinstance(value, object):\n            if hasattr(value, 'to_dict'):\n                return value.to_dict()\n            else:\n                return str(value)\n        else:\n            return value\n    def _is_internal(self, prop):\n        return prop.startswith('_')\n\nto_dict is a dictionary comprehension\n\nmydict = {key:val for key, val in dict}\nReturns a dict with key:value (e.g. property (aka attribute):value) pairs from a class’s __dict__ if the property (prop) doesn’t have an underscore\n\n_represent makes sure the “value” is a value and not object\n_is_interna1 checks whether the attribute has an underscore in the name\n\nApply the Mixin class to any class the same way as using Inheritance\nclass Employee(AsDictionaryMixin):\n    def __init__(self, id, name, address, role, payroll):\n        self.id = id\n        self.name = name\n        self.address = address\n        self._role = role\n        self._payroll = payroll\n\nAsDicitionaryMixin is used as an arg to the class\n“self._role” and “self._payroll” have underscores which tells to_dict not to include them in the resulting dictionary\nNot important to using a mixin class but note that “address” is from the Address class via composition (see below). Therefore the Address class would also need to inherit AsDictionaryMixin for this to work\n\nUtilize\nimport json\n\ndef print_dict(d):\n    print(json.dumps(d, indent=2))\n\nfor employee in EmployeeDatabase().employees:\n    print_dict(employee.to_dict())\n\nprint_dict takes the dict output of employee._to_dict and converts it to a json format"

    "text": "Composition\n\n\nNotes from Inheritance and Composition: A Python OOP Guide\nComposition models a “has a” relationship. In composition, a class known as composite contains an object of another class known to as component.\nComposition design is typically more flexible than inheritance and is preferable to Inheritance\n\nPrevents “class explosion”\n\nFor complex projects, too many classes can lead to conflicts and errors because of the inevitable complex network of classes that are connected to each other.\nYou change your program’s behavior by providing new components that implement those behaviors instead of adding new classes to your hierarchy.\n\nOnly loose class connections in composition\n\nChanges to the component class rarely affect the composite class, and changes to the composite class never affect the component class\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nClasses are written in different py scripts and imported as “modules” in another script.\nAttribute(s) from a component class (e.g. Address) are used in the composite class (e.g. Employee)\nThen a composite class attribute object is assigned to the instantiated composite class’s empty attribute\n\nThis is the magic. One class’s attribute can be used as input into another class’s attribute without being tightly coupled to that other class (aka inheritance).\n\nThat input isn’t a value. It’s class type object.\nSee Utilize code block below\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition Through __init__ Attributes\n\nExample:\n# In contacts.py\n# Component class\nclass Address:\n    def __init__(self, street, city, state, zipcode, street2=''):\n        self.street = street\n        self.street2 = street2\n        self.city = city\n        self.state = state\n        self.zipcode = zipcode\n\n# In employees.py\n# Composite class\nclass Employee:\n    def __init__(self, id, name):\n        self.id = id\n        self.name = name\n        self.address = None\n\n# ManagerRole and SalaryPolicy are classes from different modules\nclass Manager(Employee, ManagerRole, SalaryPolicy):\n    def __init__(self, id, name, weekly_salary):\n        SalaryPolicy.__init__(self, weekly_salary)\n        super().__init__(id, name)\n\nYou would import these two modules into a third script and do stuff (see next code block)\nYou initialize the Address.address attribute to “None” for now to make it optional, but by doing that, you can now assign an Address to an Employee.\n\ni.e. the attributes of an Address instance from its __init__ are now available to be assigned to a Employee instance.\n\nManager is a child class of multiple other classes (inheritance) including Employee and therefore gets an .address attribute\n\nAside: ManagerRole doesn’t have an __init__ (i.e. no attributes), so I’m not sure why super() is used here\n\nwhy not just use Employee.__init__?\nI would’ve thought that ManagerRole would’ve required the same inputs as Employee, so super() is used here to cover both at the same time.\n\nBut that’s not the case, MangerRole is there just for it’s method and not it’s attributes\n\nDoes being able to use ManageRole methods require super() (i.e. necessary for Inheritance)?\n\n\nUtilize\nmanager = employees.Manager(1, 'Mary Poppins', 3000)\nmanager.address = contacts.Address(\n    '121 Admin Rd', \n    'Concord', \n    'NH', \n    '03301'\n)\n# ... create other intances of different jobs in the company\n\n# guess this would be like a json\nemployees = [\n    manager,\n    secretary,\n    sales_guy,\n    factory_worker,\n    temporary_secretary,\n]\n\n# do work with the list class objs\nproductivity_system = productivity.ProductivitySystem()\nproductivity_system.track(employees, 40)\n\nThe Address class instance is assigned to the .address attribute of the Manager instance (which gets its .address attribute from Employee)\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition Through a Function Argument\n\nExample:\n# In hr.py\nclass PayrollSystem:\n    def calculate_payroll(self, employees):\n        print('Calculating Payroll')\n        print('===================')\n        for employee in employees:\n            print(f'Payroll for: {employee.id} - {employee.name}')\n            print(f'- Check amount: {employee.calculate_payroll()}')\n            if employee.address:\n                print('- Sent to:')\n                print(employee.address)\n            print('')\n\npayroll_system = hr.PayrollSystem()\npayroll_system.calculate_payroll(employees)\n\nThe input for calculate_payroll, employees, is a list of instantiated Employee class objects in the previous code chunk.\nName of the class is iterated and represents each instance\n\nHas attributes and methods available\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Module Classes Used as Attributes\n\nExample:\n# In employees.py\nfrom productivity import ProductivitySystem\nfrom hr import PayrollSystem\nfrom contacts import AddressBook\nclass EmployeeDatabase:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._employees = [\n            {\n                'id': 1,\n                'name': 'Mary Poppins',\n                'role': 'manager'\n            },\n            {\n                'id': 2,\n                'name': 'John Smith',\n                'role': 'secretary'\n            }\n        ]\n        self.productivity = ProductivitySystem()\n        self.payroll = PayrollSystem()\n        self.employee_addresses = AddressBook()\n    @property\n    def employees(self):\n        return [self._create_employee(**data) for data in self._employees]\n    def _create_employee(self, id, name, role):\n        address = self.employee_addresses.get_employee_address(id)\n        employee_role = self.productivity.get_role(role)\n        payroll_policy = self.payroll.get_policy(id)\n        return Employee(id, name, address, employee_role, payroll_policy)\n\nProductivitySystem, PayrollSystem, AddressBook are classes imported from various modules\nAs attributes, these classes’ methods are used in the _create_employee function\n\nReturn invokes the Employee class with values obtained by the various class methods\nEmployee class (not shown in this block) is already present in this module so it doesn’t have to be imported."

Create a “requirements.txt” file, delete the virtual environment and create a new one.\nDon’t rename a directory containing a virtual environment.

After all, it’s a bore to create and activate a virtual environment each time you want to write a five liner. A good balance is one single virtual environment you use for all things quick and dirty.\n\nCreate several virtual environments per versions of python if your project needs to support several versions.

Because most commands are Python modules, we can use this to say, “run the module X of this particular python”.\nThere is currently no way for you to run any python command reliably without “-m”.\nExamples:\n# Don't do :\npip install\n# Do:\npython -m pip install\n\n# Don't do :\nblack\n# Do:\npython -m black\n\n# Don't do :\njupyter notebook\n# Do:\npython -m jupyter notebook\n\nWhen creating a virtual environment, be explicit about which Python you use\n\nGet current python versions installed: py --list-paths (windows)\n\n\n\n\n\nvenv\n\nMisc\n\nShipped with Python\nDon’t mix pip, venv and Anaconda.

Limit yourself to Anaconda tools.\n\nCreate\n\nWindows: py -&lt;py version&gt; -m venv &lt;env name&gt;\nMac/Linux: python3.8 -m venv .venv\n\nWhere the python version is 3.8 and the environment name is “.venv”\nMac and Linux hide folders with names that have preceding “.” by default, so make sure you have “display hiddent folders” activated or you won’t see it.\n\nNaming Environments\n\nName your environment directory “.venv”, because:\n\nSome editors check for this name and automatically load it.\nIt contains “venv”, so it’s explicit.\nIt has a dot, so it’s hidden on Linux.\n\nIf you have more than one environment directory, use a suffix to distinguish them.\n\ne.g. A project that must work with two different versions of Python (3.9 and 3.10), I will have a “.venv39” and a “.venv310”\n\nNaming enviroments for misc uses\n\n“.venv_test”: located in a personal directory to install new tools you want to play with. It’s disposable, and often broken, so you can delete it and recreate it regularly.\n“.venv_scripts”: Used for all the small scripts. You don’t want to create one virtual environment for each script, so centralize everything. It’s better than installing outside of a virtual environment, but is not a big constraint.\n\n\n\nActivate\n\nWindows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\nWhere .venv is the name of the virtual environment\nMay need .bat as extension to activate\n\nMac/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate\n\nAfter that, you can use python -m pip install to install packages.\nDeactivate: deactivate\n\n\n\nvirtualenv\n\nDocs\nCreate a virtual environment\n python3 -m venv &lt;env_name&gt;\n\n-m venv tells python to run the virtual environment module, venv\nMake sure you’re in your projects directory\nRemember to add “&lt;env_name&gt;/” to .gitignore\n\nActivate environment\nsource venv/bin/activate # Mac or Linux\nvenv\\Scripts\\activate # Windows\n\n&gt;&gt; (&lt;env_name&gt;) $\n\nPrompt should change if the environment is activated\nAll pip  installed packages will now be installed into the “&lt;env_name&gt;/lib/python3.9/site-packages” directory\n\nUse the python contained within your virtual environment\npython main.py\n\nNot sure why you wouldn’t just activate the environment.\n\nDeactivate environment\ndeactivate\n\nno python  or env_name needed?\n\nReproducing environment\n\nDone using requirements.txt (see pip section for details on writing and installing)\n\nI don’t think the python version is included, so that will need to communicated manually\n\n\n\n\n\nAnaconda\n\nList environments\nconda env list # method 1\nconda info --envs # method 2\n\ndefault environment is called “base”\nActive environment will be in parentheses\nActive environment will be the one in the list with an asterix\n\nCreate a new conda environment\nconda create -n &lt;env name&gt;\nconda activate &lt;env name&gt;\nCreate a new conda environment with a specific python version\nconda create -n py310 python=3.10\nconda activate py310\nconda install jupyter jupyterlab\njupyter lab\n\nAlso install and launch jupyter lab\n\nCreate an environment from a yaml file\nconda env create -f environment.yml # Short form\nconda env create --file environment.yml # Long form\nRemove an environment\nconda deactivate &lt;env_name&gt; # Need to deactivate the environment first\nconda env remove -n &lt;env_name&gt;\n\nShould also delete environment folders (conda env list shows path to folders)\n\nClone an existing environment\nconda create -n testclone --clone test # Short form\nconda create --name testclone --clone test # Long form\n\n“testclone” is a copy of “test”\n\nActivate an environment\nconda activate &lt;env_name&gt;\nActivate environment with reticulate in R\nreticulate::use_python(\"/usr/local/bin/python\")   \nreticulate::use_condaenv(\"&lt;env name&gt;\", \"/home/jtimm/anaconda3/bin/conda\")\nDeactivate an environment\nconda activate # Option 1: activates base\nconda deactivate test # Option 2\nExport the specifications of the current environment into a YAML file into the current directory\nconda env export &gt; environment.yml # Option 1\nconda env export -f environment.yml # Option 2\nExample: Conda workflow\n\nCreate an environment that uses a specific python version\n\nWithout a specified python version, the environment will use the same version as “base”\n\nconda create -n anothertest python=3.9.7 -y\n\n-n is the name flag and “anothertest” is the name of the environment\nUses Python 3.9.7\nWithout the -y flag, there’d be a prompt you’d have to answer “yes” to\n\nActivate the environment\nconda activate anothertest\nInstall packages\n\n\nInstalling packages one at time can lead to dependency conflicts.\nConda’s official documentation recommends to install all packages at the same time so that the dependency conflicts are resolved\nconda install \"numpy&gt;=1.11\" nltk==3.6.2 jupyter -y # install specific versions\nconda install numpy nltk jupyter -y # install all latest versions\n\nDo work and deactivate environment\nconda deactivate anothertest\n\nExample Raschka workflow\n# create & activate\nconda create  --prefix ~/code/myproj python=3.8\nconda activate ~/code/myproj\n# export env\nconda env export &gt; myproj.yml\n# create new env from yaml\nconda env create --file myproj.yml --prefix ~/code/myproj2\n\n\n\nPoetry\n\nDocs (like renv)\nApparently buggy (article)\npip’s dependency resolver is more flexible and won’t die on you if the package specifies bad metadata, while poetry’s strictness may mean you can’t install some packages at all.\nCreate project\n\npoetry new &lt;project-dir-name&gt;\n\nautomatically creates a directory for your project with a skeleton\n“pyproject.toml” maintains dependencies for the project with the following sections:\n\ntool.poetry provides an area to capture information about your project such as the name, version and author(s).\ntool.poetry.dependencies lists all dependencies for your project.\ntool.poetry.dev-dependencies lists dependencies your project needs for development that should not be present in any version deployed to a production environment.\nbuild-system references the fact that Poetry has been used to manage the project.\n\n\nAdd library and create lock file: poetry add &lt;library name&gt;\n\nWhen the first library is added, a “poetry.lock” file wil be generated\n\nActivate environment: poetry shell\n\nDeactivate environment: exit\n\nRun script: poetry run python my_script.py\nPackage the project: poetry build\n\nCreates tar.gz and wheel files (.whl) in “dist” dir\n\nExample: poetry workflow (+pyenv, virtualenv)\n# Create a virtual environment called \"my-new-project\"\n# using Python 3.8.8\npyenv virtualenv 3.8.8 my-new-project\n# Activate the virtual environment\npyenv activate my-new-project\n\n{{pyenv}} - For managing the exact version of Python and activating the environment\nName your package the same name as the directory which is the same name as the virtual environment.\n\nDashes for the latter two and underscores for the package\n\nIntitialize the project and add packages (similar to renv) bash              poetry init     poetry add numpy\nReinstall dependencies\n# navigate to my project directory and run\npoetry install\nTurn off virtualenv management\n# right after installing poetry, run:\npoetry config virtualenvs.create false\n\nDefault poetry behavior is that it will manage your virtual environments for you. This may not be desirable because:\n\nCan’t just run a script from the command line. Instead, have to run poetry run my-script\n\nAwkward when you want to dockerize your code\n\nEnforces a virtual environment management framework on everybody in a shared codebase\nYour Makefile now needs to know about poetry"

    "text": "Modules\n\n.py files are called “modules.”\nA directory with .py files in which one of the files is an “__init__.py” is called a package.\nMisc\n\nResource: Make your Python life easier by learning how imports find things\nsys.path contains the list of paths where Python is looking for things to import. Your virtual environment and the directory containing your entry point are automatically added to sys.path.\n\nsys.path is a list. Which means you can .append(). Any directory you add there will have its content importable. It’s a useful hack, but use it as a last resort.\n\nWhen using -m flag to run a script, if you pass a package instead of a module, the package must contain a “__main__.py” file for it to work. This __main__.py module will run.\nIf you have scripts in your projects, don’t run them directly. Run them using “-m”, and you can assume everything starts from the root.\n\nExample:\ntop_dir\n├── foo\n│   ├── bar.py\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── blabla.py\n└── blabla.py\n\nRunning python foo/bar.py, “top_dir” is the current working directory, but “foo” is added to the sys.path.\nRunning python -m foo.bar, “top_dir” is the current working directory and added to sys.path.\n\nImports can all start from the root of the project and opened file paths as well.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\nProject Structure\n├── main.py\n├── packages\n│  └── __init__.py\n│  └── module_1.py\n│  └── module_2.py\n│  └── module_3.py\n└── └── module_4.py\n\n“__init__.py” contains only 1 line which declares all the functions (or classes?) that are in the modules\n__all__ = [\"func1\", \"func2\"]\n\nIf the module files contained classes with multiple functions, I think you’d just declare the classes and not every function in that class.\n\nIf using classes, each module should only have 1 class.\n\n\nScripts need to include “_main_” in order to used in other scripts\n# test_function.py\ndef function1(): \n    print(\"Hello world\") \nfunction1()\n\n# Define the __main__ script\nif __name__ == '__main__':   \n    # execute only if run as a script\n    function1()\n\nSays if this file is being run non-interactively (i.e. as a script), run this chunk\nAdd else: chunk, then that chunk will be run only if the file is imported as a module\nAllows you to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported\nImporting a module without _main_ in a jupyter notebook results in this\n\n\nLoading\n\nDO NOT USE from &lt;library&gt; import *\n\nThis will import anything and everything from that library and causes several problems:\n\nYou don’t know what is in that package, so you have no idea what you just imported, or even if what you want is in there.\nYou just filled your local namespace with an unknown quantity of mysterious names, and you don’t know what they will shadow.\nYour editor will have a hard time helping you since it doesn’t know what you imported.\nYour colleague will hate you because they have no idea what variables come from where.\n\nException: In the shell, it’s handy. Sometimes, you want to import all things in __init__.py and you have “__all__” defined (see above)\n\nFrom the working directory, it’s like importing from a library: from file1 import function1\nFrom a subdirectory, from subdirectory.file1 import function1\nFrom a directory outside the project, add the module to sys.path before importing it\nimport sys\nsys.path.append('/User/moduleDirectory')\n\nWhen a module is imported, it first searches for built-in modules, then the paths listed in sys.path\nThis appends the new path to the end of the sys.path\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(1, '/User/moduleDirectory')\nPuts this path at the front of the sys.path directory list.\nimport sys\nsys.path.remove('/User/NewDirectory')\n\n*delete path from sys.path after you finish*\nPython will also search this path for future projects unless they are removed"

a function across rowwise or columnwise (default is 0, which is for columnwise)\nThe fact that mutated columns are assigned to the columns of the df are what keeps it from being like summarize\n\nIf

changed to “Good By”, etc.\nIf you give it a dict, it acts like a case_when or plyr::mapvalues or maybe recode\nValues in the column but aren’t included in the dict get NaNs\nThis also can take a lambda function\nDocs (only applies to Series, so I guess that means only 1 column at a time(?))\n\napplymap\ndf[['colA', 'colD']] = df[['colA', 'colD']].applymap(lambda x: x**2)\n\nDocs\nSays it applies a function elementwise, so its probably performing a loop\n\nTherefore better to avoid if a vectorized version of the function is

If so, then the mean or median may not be a useful value to use for that variable when computing marginal effects.\n\nModes for the distribution would be a suitable alternative.\n\nMay also be useful to try to find intervals of values where there is no significant marginal effect.\nUsing all combinations of values in the observed data to compute individual marginal effects and then taking the average will result in the average interaction effect\n\nHelpful in generating inferences about the whole population of interest instead of scenarios of interest or groups of interest\n\n\nGelman and Hill: “Interactions can be important. In practice, inputs that have large main effects also tend to have large interactions with other inputs. (However, small main effects do not preclude the possibility of large interactions.)”\nWe can probe or decompose interactions by asking the following research questions:\n\nWhat is the predicted Y given a particular X and W? (predicted value)\nWhat is relationship of X on Y at particular values of W? (simple slopes/effects)(marginal effects/predicted means)\nIs there a difference in the relationship of X on Y for different values of W? (comparing marginal effects)\n\nPredictors that are uncorrelated with each other still might have interaction effects on the response variable.\n\nExample: plant growth requires sunlight and rain. Without rain, sunlight will not increase growth and vice versa, but rain with sunlight does cause growth. This interaction effect exists even though amounts of sunlight and rain aren’t (very) correlated with each other\n\nQuadratic interaction example from {marginaleffects} vignette\nDropping main effects\n\nFor the cont x cat interaction, as long as you don’t drop a categorical main effect, I don’t think it affects the model. It may or may not reparameterize the interaction coefficients so they’re the marginal effects instead contrasts. (see article)\n\ne.g. for admit ~ dept + gender:dept , the interpretation of an interaction coefficient might be something like male-female at dept A.\n\nWhether it’s okay to drop the categorical variable, may depend on whether the main effects are significant or not\nDropping a continuous main effects changes the model, so best not to ever do that in cat x cont or cont x cont interactions.\nHarrell said in a SO post that you should never do it.\n\nHe had a link to blog post he’d written but the link was dead and there wasn’t anything in his RMS book.\n\n\nFalse linearity assumptions of main effects can inflate apparent interaction effects because interactions may be colinear with the omitted non-linear effect\nInteractions may also be non-linear, but shouldn’t do this w/smaller sample sizes\n\nWith smaller sample sizes, make the main effect non-linear and the interaction component linear if the non-linear relationship is present between the interaction and outcome."

It’s confusing, so I’ve seperated the terms — one for coefficients (slopes) and another for predicted values/means (effects).\nEach of these predicted values is a Marginal Mean (term used in {emmeans}). So, the simple effect would be the difference (aka contrast) of marginal means.\n\n{marginaleffects} calls these “adjusted predictions” or “marginal means” but both seem to be the same thing.\n\nThe interaction coefficient is the difference of simple effects (aka the “difference in differences”)\nIMO this is the value is more useful than than a contrast of marginal effects\n\nFor the contrast of marginal effects, the pvals are unhelpful and the interpretation of the results is kind of janky (see interpretation in continuous:continuous &gt;&gt; Test pairwise differences (contrasts) of marginal effects section).\n\n\nSimple Slopes (aka Marginal Effects): when a Independent Variable interacts with a moderator variable (MV), its slope at a particular level or value of the MV\n\nThe main effect when an interaction is specified\ne.g. Y ~ b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X1X2\n\nInterpret marginal effect, b1, as the expected change in Y after 1 unit change in X1 when X2 = 0\n\nThe article used as reference for OLS section uses Simple Effects and Slopes interchangeably and also mixes regression coefficients with predicted values when referring to those terms throughout the tutorial.

There is no protection from the problem of multiple comparisons without this.\n\nBear in mind that because p-values are random variables–whether something is significant would vary from experiment to experiment, if the experiment were re-run–it is possible for these to be inconsistent with each other.\n\n\n\nIntercept\n\nIf variables are centered so that the predictors have mean 0, this is the expected value of Yi when the predictor values are set to their means.\nIf variables are not centered so that the predictors have mean 0, this is the expected value of Yi when the predictors are set to 0.\n\nmay not be a realistic or interpretable situation (e.g. what if the predictors were height and weight?)\n\n\nStandardized Predictors\n\nDimensions are in common units (standard deviations), and the\nCoefficients\n\nSimilar to Pearson Correlation Coefficients (r-scores)\nCan’t be compared to other standardized coefficients to determine importance\n\nUnless the “true” r-score value is zero, the estimate is driven in large part by the range of values of the predictor in the sample\nThe best that can ever be said is that variability in one explanatory variable within a specified range is more important to determining the level of the response than variability in another explanatory variable within another specified range\n\n“variability” makes sense since the units are standard deviations\nTrying to interpret these coefficients in terms of “importance” is probably not practically useful then.\n\nUnless the data is large and/or the range of the predictors is representative of the population\n\n\n\n\nDoes one coefficient have a larger effect than the other?\n\nExample: does extra hours work have a statistically larger effect on salary than does number_compliments_to_the_boss\n\nFrom Testing The Equality of Regression Coefficients\n\nlibrary(parameters)\nlibrary(effectsize)\ndata(\"hardlyworking\", package = \"effectsize\") \nhardlyworkingZ &lt;- standardize(hardlyworking)\nm &lt;- lm(salary ~ xtra_hours + n_comps, data = hardlyworkingZ) \nmodel_parameters(m)\n#&gt; Parameter  | Coefficient |  SE |        95% CI |    t(497) |      p\n#&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n#&gt; (Intercept) |  -7.19e-17 | 0.02 | [-0.03, 0.03] | -4.14e-15 | &gt; .999\n#&gt; xtra_hours  |        0.81 | 0.02 | [ 0.78, 0.84] |    46.60 | &lt; .001\n#&gt; n_comps    |        0.41 | 0.02 | [ 0.37, 0.44] |    23.51 | &lt; .001\n\n# method 1\n# assume both variables have same coeff and test if the models are different\nm0 &lt;- lm(salary ~ I(xtra_hours + n_comps), data = hardlyworkingZ) \nmodel_parameters(m0)\nanova(m0, m) # Yes they are different and therefore xtra_hours does have a stronger effect\n#&gt; Analysis of Variance Table\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Model 1: salary ~ I(xtra_hours + n_comps)\n#&gt; Model 2: salary ~ xtra_hours + n_comps\n#&gt;  Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F    Pr(&gt;F)   \n#&gt; 1    498 113.67                                 \n#&gt; 2    497  74.95  1    38.716 256.73 &lt; 2.2e-16 ***\n\n# method 2\nlibrary(car) \nlinearHypothesis(m, c(\"xtra_hours - n_comps\"))\n#&gt; Linear hypothesis test\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Hypothesis:\n#&gt; xtra_hours - n_comps = 0\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Model 1: restricted model\n#&gt; Model 2: salary ~ xtra_hours + n_comps\n#&gt; \n#&gt;  Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F    Pr(&gt;F)   \n#&gt; 1    498 113.67                                 \n#&gt; 2    497  74.95  1    38.716 256.73 &lt; 2.2e-16 ***\n\n# method 3\nlibrary(emmeans) \ntrends &lt;- rbind(\n  emtrends(m, ~1, \"xtra_hours\"),\n  emtrends(m, ~1, \"n_comps\")\n) \n# clean up so it does not error later\ntrends@grid# Regression, Gaussian\n\n1` &lt;- c(\"xtra_hours\", \"n_comps\")\ntrends@misc$estName &lt;- \"trend\"\n\ntrends\n#&gt;  1          trend    SE  df lower.CL upper.CL\n#&gt;  xtra_hours 0.811 0.0174 497    0.772    0.850\n#&gt;  n_comps    0.409 0.0174 497    0.370    0.448\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Confidence level used: 0.95 \n#&gt; Conf-level adjustment: bonferroni method for 2 estimates\n\npairs(trends)\n#&gt;  contrast            estimate    SE  df t.ratio p.value\n#&gt;  xtra_hours - n_comps    0.402 0.0251 497 16.023  &lt;.0001\n\n\nQuadratic\n\nµi = α + β1xi + β2xi2\n\nα is the intercept.

(see Ch. 13 for in Harrell’s biostats book details\n\nIn a linear model, this heterogeneity (i.e. risk factors) that’s unaccounted for gets absorbed into the error term (residual variance ↑, power ↓), but logistic/cox-ph models don’t have residuals so the treatment effect shrinks as a result.\n\n\noutcome ~ treatment + risk_factor_vars\n\nAdjusting for risk factors stops a loss of power but never increases power like it does for linear models.\n\nIn Cox and logistic models there are no residual terms, and unaccounted outcome heterogeneity has nowhere to go. So it goes into the regression coefficients that are in the model, attenuating them towards zero. Failure to adjust for easily accountable outcome heterogeneity in nonlinear models causes a loss of power as a result.\nModeling is a question of approximating the effects of baseline variables that explain outcome heterogeneity. The better the model the more complete the conditioning and the more accurate the patient-specific effects that are estimated from the model. Omitted covariates or under-fitting strong nonlinear relationships results in effectively conditioning on only part of what one would like to know. This partial conditioning still results in useful estimates, and the estimated treatment effect will be somewhere between a fully correctly adjusted effect and a non-covariate-adjusted effect."

If the median is close to zero, the model is not biased in one direction (the outcome is not over- nor under-estimated).\nThe Coefficients estimate how much a change of one unit in each predictor will affect the outcome (in logit units).\n\nThe family history predictor (fam_hx) is not significant, but trends toward an association with a decreased odds of recurrence, while the baseline Gleason score (b_gs) is significant and is associated with an 18% increased log-odds of recurrence for each extra point in the Gleason score.\n\nNull Deviance and Residual Deviance. The null deviance is measured for the null model, with only an intercept. The residual deviance is measured for your model with predictors. Your residual deviance should be lower than the null deviance.\n\nYou can even measure whether your model is significantly better than the null model by calculating the difference between the Null Deviance and the Residual Deviance. This difference [281.9 - 246.8 = 35.1] has a chi-square distribution. You can look up the value for chi-square with 2 degrees (because you had 2 predictors) of freedom.\nOr you can calculate this in R with pchisq(q = 35.1, df=2, lower.tail = TRUE) which gives you a p value of 1.\n\nThe degrees of freedom are related to the number of observations, and how many predictors you have used. If you look at the mean value in the prostate dataset for recurrence, it is 0.1708861, which means that 17% of the participants experienced a recurrence of prostate cancer. If you are calculating the mean of 315 of the 316 observations, and you know the overall mean of all 315, you (mathematically) know the value of the last observation - recurrence or not - it has no degrees of freedom. So for 316 observations, you have n-1 or 315, degrees of freedom. For each predictor in your model you ‘use up’ one degree of freedom. The degrees of freedom affect the significance of the test statistic (T, or chi-squared, or F statistic).\nObservations deleted due to missingness - the logistic model will only work on complete cases, so if one of your predictors or the outcome is frequently missing, your effective dataset size will shrink rapidly. You want to know if this is an issue, as this might change which predictors you use (avoid frequently missing ones), or lead you to consider imputation of missing values.\n\nPredicted Risk - predicted probabilities from a logistic regression model that’s used to predict the risk of an event given a set of variables.\nstr(salespeople)\n## 'data.frame':    350 obs. of  4 variables:\n##  $ promoted    : int  0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 ...\n##  $ sales        : int  594 446 674 525 657 918 318 364 342 387 ...\n##  $ customer_rate: num  3.94 4.06 3.83 3.62 4.4 4.54 3.09 4.89 3.74 3 ...\n##  $ performance  : int  2 3 4 2 3 2 3 1 3 3 ...\n\nmodel &lt;- glm(formula = promoted ~ ., data = salespeople, family = \"binomial\")\nexp(model$coefficients) %&gt;% \n  round(2)\n##  (Intercept)        sales customer_rate  performance2  performance3 \n##          0.00          1.04          0.33          1.30          1.98 \n##  performance4 \n##          2.08\n\nInterpretation:\n\nFor two salespeople with the same customer rating and the same performance, each additional thousand dollars in sales increases the odds of promotion by 4%.\n\nSales in thousands of dollars\n\nFor two salespeople with the same sales and performance, each additional point in customer rating decreases the odds of promotion by 67%\nIncreasing performance4 by 1 unit and holding the rest of the variables constant increases the odds of getting a promotion by 108%.\n\nI think this is being treated as a factor variable, and therefore the estimate is relative to the reference level (performance1).\nShould be: “Performance4 increases the odds of getting a promotion by 108% relative to having a performance1”\n\nFor two salespeople of the same sales and customer rating, performance rating has no significant effect on the odds of promotion.\n\nNone of the levels of performance were statistically significant"

    "text": "Nested Logit\n\nFits separate models for each of a hierarchically nested set of binary comparisons among the response categories. The set of m−1 models comprises a complete model for the polytomous response, just as the multinomial logit model does.\nMisc\n\nIIA still holds for two alternatives in the same dichotomy, but doesn’t hold for alternatives of different different dichotomies\nBoth MNL and Nested Logit methods have have p×(m−1) parameters. The models are not equivalent, however, in that they generally produce different sets of fitted category probabilities and hence different likelihoods.\n\nMultinomial logit model treats the response categories symmetrically\n\nExtensions\n\nPaired Combinatorial Logit\n\nAllows alternatives to be in multiple dichotomies and multiple hierarchies and for them to have more complex correlation structures\n\nIn nested logits, only alternatives within the same hierarchy are modeled as being correlated with each other.\n\nCreates pairwise dichotomies for each combination of alternatives (i.e. each alternative appears in J-1 nests)\nBest for data with fewer alternatives since the parameter space can explode fairly quickly\n\nGeneralized Nested Logit\n\nAllow alternatives to be in any dichotomy in any hierarchy, but assign a weight to each alternative in each dichotomy.\nEstimate Parameters: \\(\\lambda_k\\) (See Choice Probability below), \\(\\alpha_{jk}\\) : “weight” or proportion of alternative, \\(j\\), in dichotomy, \\(k\\)\nNeed to be careful about how many dichotomies that you place each alternative, since the parameter space can explode fairly quickly\n\nHeteroskedastic Logit\n\nHeteroskedacity in this sense means that the variance of the unobserved utility (aka residuals) can be different for each alternative\n\\[\n\\mbox{Var}(\\epsilon_{nj}) = \\frac {(\\theta_j \\pi)^2}{6}\n\\]\nSince there’s no closed form solution, simulation methods must be usded to get the choice probabilities and model parameters.\n\n\n\nConstruction of Dichotomies\n\nBy the construction of nested dichotomies, the submodels are statistically independent (because the likelihood for the polytomous response is the product of the likelihoods for the dichotomies), so test statistics, such as likelihood ratio (G2) and Wald chi-square tests for regression coefficients can be summed to give overall tests for the full polytomy.\nNested dichotomies are not unique and alternative sets of nested dichotomies are not equivalent: Different choices have different interpretations. Moreover, and more fundamentally, fitted probabilities and hence the likelihood for the nested-dichotomies model depend on how the nested dichotomies are defined.\nExample: 2 methods of splitting a 4-level response into dichotomies\n\n\nLeft: Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} → {1,2} vs {3,4} → {1} vs {2} and {3} vs {4}\nRight: (Continuous Logit) Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} → {1} vs {2, 3, 4} → {2} vs {3, 4} → {3} vs {4}\n\n{1} vs. {2,3,4} could represent highschool graduation\n{2} vs. {3,4} could represesnt enrollment in post-secondary education\n{3} vs. {4} could represent completion of a post-secondary degree.\n\n\n\nExample: {nestedLogit}\n\nSee Vignette for additional methods including effects plotting, hypothesis testing, GoF tables, etc.\nData:\n\n“partic”: labor force participation, the response, with levels:\n\n“fulltime”: working full-time\n“not.work”: not working outside the home\n“parttime” : working part-time.\n\n“hincome”: Husband’s income, in $1,000s.\n“children”: Presence of children in the home, \"absent\" or \"present\".\n\nSet-up sets of dichotomies that you want analyze\nset1 &lt;- \n  logits(work = dichotomy(\"not.work\", \n                          working = c(\"parttime\", \"fulltime\")),\n         full = dichotomy(\"parttime\", \"fulltime\"))\n\nset2 &lt;-\n  logits(full = dichotomy(nonfulltime = c(\"not.work\", \"parttime\"),\n                          \"fulltime\"),\n         part = dichotomy(\"not.work\", \"parttime\"))\n\n# How set1 response variables would be coded in base-R\nWomenlf &lt;- within(Womenlf, {\n  work = ifelse(partic == \"not.work\", 0, 1)\n  full = ifelse(partic == \"fulltime\",  1,\n                ifelse(partic == \"parttime\", 0, NA))\n})\n\nset1:\n\n“work”: Women who are NOT working outside the home vs. those who are working (either part-time or full-time).\n“full”: Women who work full-time time vs. part-time, but among only those who work.\n\nset2:\n\n“full”: {full-time} vs. {not working, part-time}\n\nThe rationale is that the real hurdle for young married women to enter the paid labor force is to combine full-time work outside the home with housework.\n\n“part”: {not working} vs. {part-time}.\n\n\nFit 1st Set\nwlf.nested.one &lt;- \n    nestedLogit(partic ~ hincome + children,\n                dichotomies = set1,\n                data = Womenlf)\n\nFits 2 glm models\n\nglm(formula = work ~ hincome + children, family = binomial, data = Womenlf)\nglm(formula = full ~ hincome + children, family = binomial, data = Womenlf)\n\nA combined model is also produced using the Delta Method\nEstimates are calculated for all models and predicted probabilities for the category levels are from the combined model.\n\nResults\n# show as odds ratios\nexp(coef(wlf.nested))\n#&gt;                   work     full\n#&gt; (Intercept)     3.8032 32.38753\n#&gt; hincome         0.9586  0.89829\n#&gt; childrenpresent 0.2069  0.07055\n\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{work, hincome}}\\) gives the estimated change in the log-odds of working vs. not working associated with a $1,000 increase in husband’s income and with having children present, each holding the other constant.\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{full, hincome}}\\) same as above, but gives the estimated change the log-odds of working full-time vs. part-time among those who are working outside the home.\nInterpretation (after exponentiation): The odds of both working and working full-time decrease with husband’s income, by about 4% and 10% respectively per $1000.

So, 7 should be the number of parameters for the full model\nTherefore, for a good-fitting model, the deviance should be close to pfull - preduced = 7 - 6 = 1\nThis example uses “number of parameters” which is the phrase in the vignette but I think it’s possible he might mean degrees of freedom (dof) which he immediatedly discusses afterwards. In the LR Test example below, under LR.Stat, which is essentially what deviance is, the number is around 11 which is quite aways from 1. Not exactly an apples to apples comparison, but the size after adding 1 parameter just makes me wonder if dof would match this scale of numbers for deviances better.\n\n\nModel selection: A difference in deviance between two nested models is identical to the likelihood ratio statistic for the comparison of these models\n\nsee below, Example: {ordinal}, model selection with LR test\n\nRequirement: Deviance tests are fine if the expected frequencies under the reduced model are not too small and as a general rule they should all be at least five.\n\nAlso see Discrete Analysis notebook\n\nResidual Deviance: Dresid = Dtotal - Dreduced\n\na concept similar to a residual sums of squares (RSS)\nTotal Deviance (Dtotal) is the Null Deviance: -2*(LogLik Null Model - LogLik Saturated model)\n\nanalogous to the total sums of squares for linear models\n\nDreduced is the calculation of “Deviance” shown above\nSee example 7, pg 13 ({ordinal} vignette) for (manual) code\n\nExample: {ordinal}, model selection with LR tests\n\nfm2 &lt;- clm(rating ~ temp, data = wine)\nanova(fm2, fm1)\n\nLikelihood ratio tests of cumulative link models:\n    formula:                link:  threshold:\nfm2 rating ~ temp          logit  flexible\nfm1 rating ~ temp + contact logit  flexible\n    no.par AIC    logLik  LR.stat df Pr(&gt;Chisq)\nfm2 5      194.03 -92.013\nfm1 6      184.98 -86.492  11.043  1  0.0008902 ***\n\nFor “fm1” model, see Proportional Odds (PO) &gt;&gt; Example {ordinal}, response = wine rating (1 to 5 = most bitter)\nSpecial method for clm objects from the package; produces an Analysis of Deviance (ANODE) table\nAdding “contact” produces a better model (pval &lt; 0.05)\nExample: {ordinal}, variable LR tests\n\ndrop1(fm1, test = \"Chi\")\n\nrating ~ contact + temp\n      Df  AIC    LRT    Pr(&gt;Chi)\n&lt;none&gt;    184.98\ncontact 1  194.03 11.043 0.0008902 ***\ntemp    1  209.91 26.928 2.112e-07 ***\n\nfm0 &lt;- clm(rating ~ 1, data = wine)\nadd1(fm0, scope = ~ temp + contact, test = \"Chi\")\n\n        Df  AIC    LRT      Pr(&gt;Chi)\n&lt;none&gt;      215.44\ntemp    1    194.03  23.4113  1.308e-06 ***\ncontact 1    209.91  7.5263  0.00608 **\n\nFor “fm1” model, see Proportional Odds (PO) &gt;&gt; Example {ordinal}, response = wine rating (1 to 5 = most bitter)\ndrop1\n\nTests the same thing as the Wald tests in the summary except with χ2 instead of t-tests\n\ni.e. whether the estimates, while controlling for the other variables, differ from 0, except with LR tests.\n\nIn this case, LR tests slightly more significant than the Wald tests\n\nadd1\n\nTests variables where they’re the only explanatory variable in the model\nBoth variables still significant even without controlling for the other variable"

The thresholds represent the marginal response probabilities in the J categories.\nEach cumulative logit is a model equation with a threshold for an intercept\n\nTo set the location of the latent variable, it is common to set a threshold to zero. Usually, the first of the threshold parameters (θ1) is set to zero.\n\nAlternatively, the model intercept (β0) is set to zero and J −1 thresholds are estimated. (Think this is the way {ordinal} does it.)\n\n\nStructured Thresholds\n\nIf ratings are the response variable, placing restrictions on thresholds and fitting a model allows us to test assumptions on how the judges are using the response scale\nAn advantage of applying additional restrictions on the thresholds is model has fewer parameters to estimate which increases model sensitivity.\nThreshold distances are affected by the shape of the latent variable distribution which is determined by the link function used\n\ni.e. if it’s determined that threshold distances are equidistant under a normal distribution (logit link) assumption, then they will not be equidistant if a different link function is used.\n\nExample: is the reponse scale being treated by judges as equidistant between values.\n\ne.g. is the distance between a rating of 2 and a rating of 1 the same as the distance between a rating of 2 and a rating of 3?\nMathematically: θj − θj−1 = constant for j = 2, …, J−1 where θ are the thresholds and J is the number of levels in the response variable.\nFit equidistant model\n\n\n\nfm.equi &lt;- clm(rating ~ temp + contact, data = wine, threshold = \"equidistant\")\nsummary(fm.equi)\n\nlink  threshold  nobs  logLik  AIC    niter  max.grad  cond.H\nlogit equidistant 72  -87.86  183.73 5(0)  4.80e-07  3.2e+01\n\n          Estimate Std.Error z.value Pr(&gt;|z|)\ntempwarm  2.4632  0.5164    4.77    1.84e-06 ***\ncontactyes 1.5080  0.4712    3.20    0.00137 **\n\nThreshold coefficients:\n            Estimate Std.Error z.value\nthreshold.1 -1.0010  0.3978  -2.517\nspacing      2.1229  0.2455    8.646\n\nspacing: average distance between consecutive thresholds\nCompare spacing parameter with your model’s average spacing\n\nmean(diff(coef(fm1)[1:4]))\n2.116929\n\n“fm1” is from an example in the Proportional Odds (PO) section\nResult: “fm1” spacing is very close to “fm.equi” spacing.

If data outside this range are omitted completely, we call it truncated\n\ni.e. instances outside the range are NOT recorded. No evidence of these instances are in the data.\nTruncated Regression - Also assumes constant (homoskedastic variance)\nA poisson model will try to predict 0s even if 0s are impossible. Therefore, you need a zero-truncated model.\nThe truncated normal model is different from a glm, because μ and σ are not orthogonal and have to be estimated simultaneously. Misspecification of one parameter will lead to inconsistent estimation of the other.

Thus, it only knows that your claim is greater than u, not the exact claim amount.\n\n“censored” because the values (claims) that are exactly u (policy limit) imply that claim is greater than u, so the instances are recorded but the true values are unknown.\n“right” because the values are above u and not below\n\n\nMeasuring Wind Speed: The instrument needs a minimum wind speed, m, to start working.\n\nIf wind speeds below this minimum are recorded as the minimum value, m, the data is censored.\n\ni.e. some other instrument detects a wind instance occurred and that instance is recorded as m even though the true speed of the wind of that instance is unknown.\n\nIf wind speeds below this minimum are NOT recorded at all, the data is truncated.\n\ni.e. any wind instances (detected or not) are not recorded. No evidence in the data that these instances will have ever occurred."

Often used when repeated measures (panel data) for an individual are collected over time.\n\nYou make a good guess on the within-subject covariance structure. The model averages over all subjects, and instead of assuming that data were generated from a certain distribution, it uses moment assumptions to iteratively choose the best β to describe the relationship between covariates and response.\nA semiparametric method: while we impose some structure on the data generating process (linearity), we do not fully specify its distribution. Estimating β is purely an exercise in optimization.\nLimitations\n\nLikelihood-based methods are not available for usual statistical inference. GEE is a quasi-likelihood method.\nUnclear on how to perform model selection, as GEE is just an estimating procedure. There is no goodness-of-fit measure readily available.\nNo subject-specific estimates; if that is the goal of your study, use a different method. (see below)\n\nOther option is Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), but GLMMs require some parametric assumptions (See Econometrics, Mixed Effects)\n\n*Note that the interpretations of the resulting estimates are different for GLMM and GEE*\n\nScenarios\n\nYou are a doctor.

    "text": "62.1 Misc\n\nModel for estimating the time until a particular event occurs\n\ne.g. death of a patient being treated for a disease, failure of an engine part in a vehicle\n\nPrediction models for survival outcomes are important for clinicians who wish to estimate a patient’s risk (i.e. probability) of experiencing a future outcome. The term ‘survival’ outcome is used to indicate any prognostic or time-to-event outcome, such as death, progression, or recurrence of disease. Such risk estimates for future events can support shared decision making for interventions in high-risk patients, help manage the expectations of patients, or stratify patients by disease severity for inclusion in trials.1 For example, a prediction model for persistent pain after breast cancer surgery might be used to identify high risk patients for intervention studies\nOutcome variable: Time until event occurs\npackages\n\n{survival}\n{censored} - tidymodels package for censored and survival modelling\n{quantreg} - quantile survival regression\n{msm} - multi-state models\n\nVignette for {msm}\nSee Multistate Models for Medical Applications\n\nTutorial using a heart transplant dataset\n\nStandard survival models only directly model two states: alive and dead. Multi-state models enable directly modeling disease progression where patients are observed to be in various states of health or disease at random intervals, but for which, except for death, the times of entering or leaving states are unknown.\nMulti-state models easily accommodate interval censored intermediate states while making the usual assumption that death times are known but may be right censored.\n\n{grf} - generalized random forest; causal forest with time-to-event data\n{partykit} - conditional inference trees; model-based recursive partitioning trees; can be used with {survival} to create random survival forests\n\n{bonsai}: tidymodels partykit conditional trees, forests; successor to treesnip - Model Wrappers for Tree-Based Models\n\n{aorsf} - optimized software to fit, interpret, and make predictions with oblique random survival forests (ORSFs) {{sklearn}} - Random Survival Forests, Survival Support Vector Machine\n\nNotes from\n\nWhat is Cox’s proportional hazards model?\n\nWhy not use a standard regression model?\n\nUnits that “survive” until the end of the study will have a censored survival time.\n\ni.e. we won’t have an observed survival time for these units because they survive for an unknown time after the study is completed.\nWe don’t want to discard these units though, as they still have useful information.\n\n\nSample Size\nModels\n\nKaplan Meier model (i.e. K-M survival curve)\n\nOften used as a baseline in survival analysis\nCan not be used to compare risk between groups and compute metrics like the hazard ratio\n\nExponential model, the Weibull model, Cox Proportional-Hazards, Log-logistic and the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT)\nMulti-State Models\nHazard rates and Cumulative Hazard rates are typical quantities of interest\n\nLog-Rank Test (aka Mantel-Cox test) - tests if two groups survival curves are different\n\nnon-parametric; a special case with one binary X\nThe intuition behind the test is that if the two groups have different hazard rates, the two survival curves (so their slopes) will differ.\nCompares the observed number of events in each group to what would be expected if the survival curves were identical (i.e., if the null hypothesis were true).\nExample\nlibrary(survival)\ndat &lt;- data.frame(\n  group = c(rep(1, 6), rep(2, 6)),\n  time = c(4.1, 7.8, 10, 10, 12.3, 17.2, 9.7, 10, 11.1, 13.1, 19.7, 24.1),\n  event = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0)\n)\ndat\n##    group time event\n## 1      1  4.1    1\n## 2      1  7.8    0\n## 3      1 10.0    1\n## 4      1 10.0    1\n## 5      1 12.3    0\n## 6      1 17.2    1\n## 7      2  9.7    1\n## 8      2 10.0    1\n## 9      2 11.1    0\n## 10    2 13.1    0\n## 11    2 19.7    1\n## 12    2 24.1    0\nsurvdiff(Surv(time, event) ~ group,\n  data = dat\n)\n##        N Observed Expected (O-E)^2/E (O-E)^2/V\n## group=1 6        4    2.57    0.800      1.62\n## group=2 6        3    4.43    0.463      1.62\n## \n##  Chisq= 1.6  on 1 degrees of freedom, p= 0.2\n\n# plot curves with pval from test\nfit &lt;- survfit(Surv(time, event) ~ group, data = dat)\nggsurvplot(fit,\n  pval = TRUE,\n  pval.method = TRUE\n)\n\npval &gt; 0.05, so there isn’t enough evidence to that they’re different."

Intuitively, a higher risk should result in a shorter time to the adverse event.

Don’t call modules inside of some other reactive statement like observe()\n\nBad module calling example\n\n\n    observe({\n      # Process data before sending it into the module\n      if (input$filterTo != \"special\") {\n        myModuleServer(\n          data %&gt;% \n            filter(val == input$filterTo)\n        )\n      } else {\n        # Handle special case \n        myModuleServer(\n          data %&gt;% \n            ...\n        )\n      }\n    })\n\nGood module calling example\n\n    server &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n\n      # initialise the app state...\n      app_state &lt;- reactiveValues(...)\n\n      ... \n\n      # add server logic\n      mod_commute_mode(\"mode\", app_state)\n      mod_commute_map(\"map\", app_state)\n      mod_commute_table(\"table\", app_state)\n      mod_commute_filter(\"filter\", app_state)\n    }\n\nLiberally use reactive variables and your code becomes much cleaner, faster, and more maintainable\n\nThere shouldn’t be any deeply nested bracketing in your code\n\n\ndatasheet_df &lt;- reactive({\n  sample_data %&gt;%\n  filter(site %in% input$selectSiteDatasheets) %&gt;% \n  ...\n})\n# Download button\noutput$download_datasheet &lt;- downloadHandler(\n  filename = function() {\n    paste(\"spreadsheet_\", input$selectSiteDatasheets, \".csv\", sep = \"\")\n  },\n  content = function(file) {\n    write.csv(datasheet_df(), file, row.names = FALSE)\n  }\n)\n\nHere datasheet_df is a reactive variable that Shiny will always keep up to date. Therefore the download button only needs to describe that it uses whatever the current value of that reactive is.\n\nThis separation keeps the code easy to reason about and allows easy use of datasheet_df in other contexts than just the download button."

(see example below)\nImportant for the bottom layers to be things that you might change most often. This way you don’t have to reinstall R everytime you change something in your app code.\n\nExample\nMethods for installing dependencies (article)\n\nlittler::install.r (littler is installed on all Rocker images)\nExample: image size comparison\n\n\nREPOSITORY                  TAG                SIZE\nanalythium/covidapp-shiny  renv                1.7GB\nanalythium/covidapp-shiny  deps                1.18GB\nanalythium/covidapp-shiny  basic              1.24GB\n\nbasic image (aka “explicit” method above): 105 packages installed\ndeps image (aka “DESCRIPTION” method above): has remotes added on top of these; remotes::install_deps() to install packages from the DESCRIPTION file\nrenv image has remotes, renv and BH as extras.\n\nBH seems to be responsible for the size difference, this package provides Boost C++ header files.\nYour app will probably work perfectly fine without BH.\nYou can use renv::remove(\"BH\") to remove BH from the project or use the “custom” model and list all the packages to be added to the lockfile\n\n{deps} (article)\n\nlightweight method that installs packages via a DESCRIPTION json file\n\nBlend between package and renv approaches to dependency management\n\nProject scripts contain roxygen-like, decorator code about packages and those are used to build the DESCRIPTION json file\nImage size should be similar to the “deps/DESCRIPTION” method above\n\nSecurity\n\n(taken from above dockerfile example)\nBest to create user groups and not run app as a root sudo\nchown, an abbreviation of change owner, is used on Unix and Unix-like operating systems to change the owner of file system files, directories. Unprivileged users who wish to change the group membership of a file that they own may use chgrp\n\nCI/CD\n\nUse github action for docker caching which builds the image and pushes your image to Docker Hub\nThen your compute instance (PaaS) pulls the image from that registry\n\n\nData strategies\n\nDo as little processing as possible in the app\nOptions\n\nBundle datasets alongside the source code, such that wherever the app is deployed, those datasets are available.\n\nDrawback: data would need to be kept in version control along with your source code, and a new deployment of the app would be required whenever the data is updated.\n\nFor frequently updated datasets, this is impractical, but may be valuable if those datasets are unlikely to change during the lifetime of a project.\n\n\nKeep data in cloud storage\n\nAllows collaborators to upload new data on an ad-hoc basis without touching the app itself. The app would then download data from the cloud for presentation during each user session\nBetter for frequently updated datasets\nOptimization (loading in secs instead of mins)\n\nUse parquet file format\nCaching the data for the app’s landing page or use asynchronous computing to initiate downloading the data while presenting a less data-intensive landing page\n\n\nPartition data:\n\nRaw data that is not computationally expensive or needs no processing\nProcessed data that is more computationally expensive to process.\n\nThe data processing pipeline is outside of the app. (e.g. GitHub Actions workflow)\nData storage and app server should be in the same region to reduce latency\n\nCreate Pipeline Triggers\n\nWhen new raw data is uploaded, then data gets processed and into the app in a timely manner.\nWhen the source code for the app or the data processing pipeline change, the data processing pipeline should run afresh.\nIf changes to the structure of the raw dataset mean that the data processing pipeline produces malformed processed data, there should be a way to log that.\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimization\n\nMisc\n\nResources\n\nOffload Shiny’s Workload: COVID-19 processing for the WHO/Europe\n\nOverview of how they reduced loading times of a World Health Organization app from minutes to seconds\n\nShiny docs: caching and async programming\nChapter 15 of Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps covers, in detail, some common performance pitfalls and how to solve them.\n\n\nReduce the amount of computation occuring inside the app (by caching plots and tables, or by precomputing your data),\nAnalyze whether the app could be using too much reactivity or regenerating UI elements unnecessarily\n\nDevelopment\n\nAWS deployment\n\nNotes from\n\nCreating a Dashboard Framework with AWS (Part 1)\n\nFeatures\n\nSecure, end-to-end encrypted (SSL, TLS) access to dashboards.\nSecure authentication through E-mail and Single-Sign-On (SSO).\nHorizontal scalability of dashboards according to usage, fail-safe.\nEasy adaptability by analysts through automation and continuous integration (CI/CD).\nEasy maintenance and extensibility for system operators.\n\nComponents\n\nApplication Load Balancer (ALB) to handle secure end-to-end (SSL) encrypted access to the dashboards based on different host names (host-based-routing).\nAWS Cognito for user authentication based on E-mail and SSO through Ping Federate.\nAWS Fargate for horizontal scalability, fail-safe operations and easy maintenance.\nAWS Codepipeline and Codebuild for automated build of dashboard Docker containers.\nExtensive usage of managed services requiring low maintenance (Fargate, Cognito, ALB) and Amazon Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to define and manage infrastructure-as-code managed in Git and deployed via Code Pipelines.\n\n\nAetna Insurance Notes from Q&A Shatrunjai Singh | R in Insurance | RStudio\n\nRStudio Connect\n\nproduction & dev “version” (branches?)\n\nSteps\n\nBuild minimum viable product (MVP)\nUpload to dev branch\nPerform Test & Learn for about a month\n\nGive it to a small number of ppl\nHave them use it and get feedback\n\nCreate “dev2” app\n\nApply fixes\nAdd most critical elements according to the feedback\n\nGive to a different, slightly larger group of people\n\nLooking for issues, bugs, etc.\n\nOnce satisfied that all major kinks are worked out, move app to production branch\n\nLaunched to entire company\n\nFor the 1st 6 months, “recalibrate analysis” every 1.5 months\nRecalibrate every 6 months afterwards\n\nDo packages need updated?\nDo the models need retrained\nIs the app still working as intended?\nIf it’s all good, do some code optimization, refactoring, etc.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n{shinyauthr}\n\nfor user authentication.

It doesn’t elicit the behavior we want for an engaging, learning experience. \n\n  This stress triggers two subconscious actions – run or freeze. Both lead to cognitive load and negative perception, and ultimately, failed adoption.\n      Running is expressed in bounce rate. A user will enter the app, become frustrated, and leave.\n\n      Freezing means that a user pauses with a delayed time to understand.

    "text": "Terms\n\nBatch - a set of sql statements e.g. statements between BEGIN and END\nCompiled object - you can create a function written in C/C++ and load into the database (at least in postgres) to achieve high performance.\nCorrelated Columns - tells how good the match between logical and physical ordering is.\nCorrelated/Uncorrelated Subqueries\n\ncorrelated- a type of query, where inner query depends upon the outcome of the outer query in order to perform its execution\n\nA correlated subquery can be thought of as a filter on the table that it refers to, as if the subquery were evaluated on each row of the table in the outer query\n\n\nuncorrelated - a type of sub-query where inner query doesn’t depend upon the outer query for its execution.\n\nIt is an independent query, the results of which are returned to and used by the outer query once (not per row).\n\n-- Uncorrelated subquery:\n-- inner query, c1, only depends on table2\nselect c1, c2\n  from table1 where c1 = (select max(x) from table2);\n\n-- Correlated subquery:\n-- inner query, c1, depends on table1 and table2\nselect c1, c2\n  from table1 where c1 = (select x from table2 where y = table1.c2);\n\nFunctions execute at a different level of priority and are handled differently than Views. You will likely see better performance.\nIndex - a quick lookup table (e.g. field or set of fields) for finding records users need to search frequently. An index is small, fast, and optimized for quick lookups. It is very useful for connecting the relational tables and searching large tables. (also see DB, Engineering &gt;&gt; Cost Optimizations)\nMigrations (schema) - version control system for your database schema. Management of incremental, reversible changes and version control to relational database schemas. A schema migration is performed on a database whenever it is necessary to update or revert that database’s schema to some newer or older version.\nPhysical Ordering - A PostgreSQL table consists of one or more files of 8KB blocks (or “pages”). The order in which the rows are stored in the file is the physical ordering.\nPredicate - defines a logical condition being applied to rows in a table. (e.g. IN, EXISTS, BETWEEEN, LIKE, ALL, ANY)\nScalar/Non-Scalar Subqueries\n\nA scalar subquery returns a single value (one column of one row). If no rows qualify to be returned, the subquery returns NULL.\nA non-scalar subquery returns 0, 1, or multiple rows, each of which may contain 1 or multiple columns. For each column, if there is no value to return, the subquery returns NULL. If no rows qualify to be returned, the subquery returns 0 rows (not NULLs).\n\nSelectivity - the fraction of rows in a table or partition that is chosen by the predicate\n\nRefers to the quality of a filter in its ability to reduce the number of rows that will need to be examined and ultimately returned\n\nWith a high selectivity, using the primary key or indexes to get right to the rows of interest\nWith a low selectivity, a full table scan would likely be needed to get the rows of interest.\n\nHigher selectivity means: more unique data; fewer duplicates; fewer number of rows for each key value\nUsed to estimate the cost of a particular access method; it is also used to determine the optimal join order. A poor choice of join order by the optimizer could result in a very expensive execution plan.\n\nSoft-deleted - An operation in which a flag is used to mark data as unusable, without erasing the data itself from the database\nSurrogate key - very similar to a primary key in that it is a unique value for an object in a table. However, rather than being derived from actual data present in the table, it is a field generated by the object itself. It has no business value like a primary key does, but is rather only used for data analysis purposes. Can be generated using different columns that already exist in your table or more often from two or more tables. dbt function definition\n\nExamples: PostgreSQL serial column, Oracle sequence column, or MySQL auto_increment column, Snowflake _file + _line columns\nExample: Each employee id is concatenated with a department id (e.g. marketing or finance)\n\n\nTransaction - a set of queries tied together such that if one query fails, the entire set of queries are rolled back to a pre-query state if the situation dictates.\n\nA database transaction, by definition, must be atomic, consistent, isolated and durable. These are popularly known as ACID properties.  These properties can ensure the concurrent execution of multiple transactions without conflict.\n\nViews - database objects that represent saved SELECT queries in “virtual” tables.\n\nContains a query plan.  For each query executed, the planner has to evaluate what’s being asked and calculate an optimal path. Views already have this plan calculated so it allows subsequent queries to be returned with almost no friction in processing aside from data retrieval.\nSome views are updateable but under certain conditions (1-1 mapping of rows in view to underlying table, no group_by, etc.)"

It will show the process the system goes through to get to the data and return it.\nEXPLAIN\nSELECT\n    s.id AS student_id,\n    g.score\nFROM\n    students AS s\nLEFT JOIN\n    grades AS g\n    ON s.id = g.student_id\nWHERE\n    g.score &gt; 90\nORDER BY\n    g.score DESC;\n/*\nQUERY PLAN\n----------\nSort (cost=80.34..81.88 rows=617 width=8)\n[...] Sort Key: g.score DESC\n[...] -&gt; Hash Join (cost=16.98..51.74 rows=617 width=8)\n[...] Hash Cond: (g.student_id = s.id)\n[...] -&gt; Seq Scan on grades g (cost=0.00..33.13 rows=617 width=8)\n[...] Filter: (score &gt; 90)\n[...] -&gt; Hash (cost=13.10..13.10 rows=310 width=4)\n[...] -&gt; Seq Scan on students s (cost=0.00..13.20 rows=320 width=4)\n*/\n\nSequentially scanning (“Seq Scan”) the grades and students tables because the tables aren’t indexed\n\nAny Seq Scan, parallel or not, is sub-optimal\n\nEXPLAIN (BUFFERS) also shows how may data pages the database had to fetch using slow disk read operations (“read”), and how many of them were cached in memory (“shared hit”)\n\nEXPLAIN ANALYZE - tells the planner to not only hypothesize on what it would do, but actually run the query and show the results.\n\nshows where indexes are being hit — or not hit as it may be. You can step through and re-optimize your basic and complex queries.\n\nGETDATE() - Gets the current date\nGO - Not a sql function. Used by some interpreters as a reset.\n\ni.e. any variables set before the GO statement will now not be recognized by the interpreter.\nHelps to separate code into different sections\n\nISDATE - boolean - checks that a variable is a date type\nQUALIFY - clause filters the results of window functions.\n\nuseful when answering questions like fetching the most XXX value of each category\nQUALIFY does with window functions as what HAVING does with GROUP BY. As a result, in the order of execution, QUALIFY is evaluated after window functions.\nSee Business Queries &gt;&gt; Get the latest order from each customer\n\nUNNEST - BigQuery - takes an ARRAY and returns a table with a row for each element in the ARRAY (docs)\n\nGoogle Analytics, Analysis &gt;&gt; Example 17"

(However, PL/pgSQL users do not normally need to worry about that, since FOR loops automatically use a cursor internally to avoid memory problems.)\nA more interesting usage is to return a reference to a cursor that a function has created, allowing the caller to read the rows. This provides an efficient way to return large row sets from functions.\n\nExample (article (do not pay attention dynamic sql. it’s for embedding sql in C programs))\nDECLARE\n    cur_orders CURSOR FOR \n        SELECT order_id, product_id, quantity\n        FROM order_details\n        WHERE product_id = 456;\n    product_inventory INTEGER;\nBEGIN\n    OPEN cur_orders;\n    LOOP\n        FETCH cur_orders INTO order_id, product_id, quantity;\n        EXIT WHEN NOT FOUND;\n        SELECT inventory INTO product_inventory FROM products WHERE product_id = 456;\n        product_inventory := product_inventory - quantity;\n        UPDATE products SET inventory = product_inventory WHERE product_id = 456;\n    END LOOP;\n    CLOSE cur_orders;\n    -- do something after updating the inventory, such as logging the changes\nEND;\n\nA table called “products” that contains information about all products, including the product ID, product name, and current inventory. You can use a cursor to iterate through all orders that contain a specific product and update its inventory.\nA cursor called “cur_orders” that selects all order details that contain a specific product ID. We then define a variable called “product_inventory” to store the current inventory of the product.\nInside the loop, we fetch each order ID, product ID, and quantity from the cursor, subtract the quantity from the current inventory and update the products table with the new inventory value.\nFinally, we close the cursor and do something after updating the inventory, such as logging the changes."

As you can see there is a tie between 1st two rows i.e. first two rows have same value in Shipping_Cost column (which is mentioned in ORDER BY clause).\nDENSE_RANK is similar to the RANK , but it does not skip any numbers even if there is a tie between the rows. This you can see in Blue box in the above picture.\nRank resets to 1 when “Shipping_Address” changes location\n\nExample: Total order quantity for each month\nSELECT strftime('%m', OrderDate) as Month,\n      SUM(Quantity) as Total_Quantity\nfrom Dummy_Sales_Data_v1\nGROUP BY strftime('%m', OrderDate)\n\nstrftime extracts the month (%m) from the datetime column, “OrderDate”\n\nExample: Daily counts of open jobs\n\nThe issue is that there aren’t rows for transactions that remain in a type of holding status\n\ne.g. Job Postings website has date columns for the date the job posting was created, the date the job posting went live on the website, and the date the job posting was taken down (action based timestamps), but no dates for the status between “went live” and “taken down”.\n\n\n-- create a calendar column\nSELECT parse_datetime('2020–01–01 08:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-dd H:m:s') + (interval '1' day * d) as cal_date from \nFROM ( SELECT\nROW_NUMBER() OVER () -1 as d\nFROM\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p0,\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p1,\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p2,\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p3,\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p4,\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p5,\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p6,\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p7,\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p8,\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p9,\n(SELECT 0 as n UNION SELECT 1) p10\n)\n\n-- left-join your table to the calendar column\nSelect\n    c.cal_date,\n    count(distinct opp_id) as \"historical_prospects\"\nFrom calendar c\nLeft Join\n    opportunities o\n    on\n        o.stage_entered ≤ c.cal_date \n        and (o.stage_exited is null or o.stage_exited &gt; c.cal_date)\n\nCalendar column should probably be a CTE\nNotes from Using SQL to calculate trends based on historical status\nSome flavours of SQL have a generate_series function, which will create this calendar column for you\nFor one particular month, then create an indicator column with “if posting_publish_date ≤ 2022–01–01 and (posting_closed_date is null or posting_closed_date &gt; 2022–01–31) then True” and then filter for True and count.\n\nExample: Get the latest order from each customer\n-- Using QUALIFY\nselect\n    date,\n    customer_id,\n    order_id,\n    price\nfrom customer_order_table\nqualify row_number() over (partition by customer_id order by date desc) = 1\n;\n\n-- CTE w/window function\nwith order_order as\n(\nselect\n    date,\n    customer_id,\n    order_id,\n    price,\n    row_number() over (partition by customer_id order by date desc)   \n    as order_of_orders\nfrom customer_order_table \n)\n\nselect\n    *\nfrom order_order\nwhere order_of_orders = 1\n;\nResults:\n| date      | customer_id | order_id | price |\n|------------|-------------|----------|-------|\n| 2022-01-03 | 002        | 212      | 350  |\n| 2022-01-06 | 005        | 982      | 300  |\n| 2022-01-07 | 001        | 109      | 120  |\nMedians\n\nNotes from How to Calculate Medians with Grouping in MySQL\n\nVariables:\n\npid: unique id variable\ncategory: A or B\nprice: random value between 1 and 6\n\n\nExample: Overall median price\nSELECT AVG(sub.price) AS median\nFROM ( \n    SELECT @row_index := @row_index + 1 AS row_index, p.price\n    FROM products.prices p, (SELECT @row_index := -1) r\n    WHERE p.category = 'A'\n    ORDER BY p.price \n) AS sub\nWHERE sub.row_index IN (FLOOR(@row_index / 2), CEIL(@row_index / 2))\n;\n\nmedian|\n------+\n   3.0|\n\n@row_index is a SQL variable that is initiated in the FROM statement and updated for each row in the SELECT statement.\nThe column whose median will be calculated (the price column in this example) should be sorted. It doesn’t matter if it’s sorted in ascending or descending order.\nAccording to the definition of median, the median is the value of the middle element (total count is odd) or the average value of the two middle elements (total count is even). In this example, category A has 5 rows and thus the median is the value of the third row after sorting. The values of both FLOOR(@row_index / 2) and CEIL(@row_index / 2) are 2 which is the third row. On the other hand, for category B which has 6 rows, the median is the average value of the third and fourth rows.\n\nExample: Median price for each product\nSELECT\n    sub2.category,\n    CASE WHEN MOD(sub2.total, 2) = 1 THEN sub2.mid_prices\n         WHEN MOD(sub2.total, 2) = 0 THEN (SUBSTRING_INDEX(sub2.mid_prices, ',', 1) + SUBSTRING_INDEX(sub2.mid_prices, ',', -1)) / 2\n    END AS median    \nFROM \n    (\n        SELECT \n            sub1.category,\n            sub1.total,\n            CASE WHEN MOD(sub1.total, 2) = 1 THEN SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(sub1.prices, ',', CEIL(sub1.total/2)), ',', '-1')\n                 WHEN MOD(sub1.total, 2) = 0 THEN SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(sub1.prices, ',', sub1.total/2 + 1), ',', '-2')\n            END AS mid_prices\n        FROM \n            (\n                SELECT\n                    p.category,\n                    GROUP_CONCAT(p.price ORDER BY p.price) AS prices,\n                    COUNT(*) AS total\n                FROM products.prices p\n                GROUP BY p.category\n            ) sub1\n    ) sub2\n;\n\ncategory|median|\n--------+------+\nA       |3     |\nB       |3.5   |\n\nBreaking down the subqueries\n\nSort prices per category\nSELECT\n    category,\n    GROUP_CONCAT(price ORDER BY p.price) AS prices,\n    COUNT(*) AS total\nFROM products.prices p\nGROUP BY p.category\n;\n\ncategory|prices     |total|\n--------+-----------+-----+\nA       |1,2,3,4,5  |    5|\nB       |1,2,3,4,5,6|    6|\n\nIf your table has a lot of data, GROUP_CONCAT would not contain all the data.

The effect of the unobserved portion (“hidden”) can only be estimated.\n\nObserved portion is modeled using arima, glm, rf, etc.\nUnobserved portion is modeled using Markov process\n\nSort of like a latent variable that’s values are states (aka regimes)\n\nThe two models produce a final prediction by calculating an expected value at each step that uses predictions from observed model and probabilities from the unobserved model.\n\nUse Cases\n\nStudying human workflows using computer event logs. Part of that is taking a user’s raw event log (keystrokes, URLs visited, etc.) and determining what they were doing at each time (background research, document review, etc.). Sometimes you can guess from one event in isolation, but usually you also need to look at the events before and after to have confidence.\nYou have a photograph of a page from a novel, and you want to digitize the text. The photograph is already segmented into images of words. Most of them can be decoded with OCR, but some words are ambiguous because of dirt on the original page (is that “quick” or “quack”?). You want to use the surrounding words to pick the best option.\nYou have a sequence of brain scans, taken every second while a person was playing a video game. During the game their avatar moves in and out of buildings, and your goal is to guess whether it is inside or outside using only the brain scans. Any given scan is very ambiguous, but the avatar usually stays inside/outside for many seconds at a time. You expect large spans of time where the avatar is in(out)side, and where the brain scans look slightly more in(out)side on average.\n\nComponents\n\nAn underlying markov chain that describes how likely you are to transition between different states (or stay in the same state). Typically this underlying state is the thing that you’re really interested in. If there are k states in the HMM then the markov chain consists of:\n\nk*k transition matrix saying how likely you are to transition from a state Sa to a state Sb\nk-length vector saying how likely you are to start off in each of the states.\n\nA probability model that lets you compute Pr[O|S] — the probability of seeing observation O if we assume that the underlying state is S.\n\nUnlike the markov chain, which has a fixed format, the model for Pr[O|S] can be arbitrarily complex. In many HMMs though Pr[O|S] is pretty simple: each state S is a different loaded die, and the Pr[O|S] are its probabilities of landing on each side.\n\n\nBaum-Welch algorithm\n\nSpecific case of the EM algorithm\n\nAs with the EM algorithm, solutions are only locally optimal\n\nMeaning you’re results will vary for each model you run (i.e. a non-convex problem)\n\n\nStep summary\n\nGuess at what the state labels are and train an HMM using those guesses\n\nThe guess is usually about the parameters of the HMM and not actually the states.\n\nTypically random values from a dirichlet distribution\n\n\nUse the trained HMM to make better guesses at the states, and re-train the HMM on those better guesses\n\nUses the Forward-Backward Algorithm\n\nContinue process until the trained HMM stabilizes.\n\nForward-Backward Algorithm\n\nFind the most likely state for each timestep\n\nUnlike the Viterbi algorithm which computes the mostly likely sequence of states\n\nIn practice, both algorithms only disagree about 5% of the time\n\n\n\n\nMitigating the local optimum issue\n\nYou can simplify your HMM.\n\nThe number of local optima can grow exponentially with the number of parameters in your HMM. If you reduce the parameter size you can reduce the number of local optima there are to fall into.\n\nExamples\n\nUsing a 2-state rather than a 3-state HMM.\nIf your target is multinomial, collapse categories so that the cardinality is smaller.\n\n\n\nUse business logic or domain expertise to have an initial HMM that is similar to what you expect the ultimate outcome to be.\n\nDifferent local optima often have large qualitative differences between each other, so on a gross level the HMM you ultimately converge on is likely to resemble the one you started with.\nDo make sure to have your guess be partly random though — there could be several local optima that are consistent with your business intuitions, and if so you want to know about it.\n(Sounds like formulating a prior)\n\n\nMarkov Switching Dynamic Regression (MSDR)\n\nHMM for times series which uses dynamic regression as the observed model.\nNotes from A Worm’s Eye-View of the Markov Switching Dynamic Regression Model\nBasic formula for each time step, t\n\nμ^tj: final prediction for time step, t\n\nThe j subscript is just saying that the hidden state variable st is part of the final prediction\n\nst: hidden random variable that’s made-up of states (aka regimes) and helps determine the final prediction, μ^\n\nTheoretically, a change in value of st impacts the distributional parameters (e.g. mean, variance) of the observed variable, yt\nst is “hidden” because we do not know exactly when it changes its regime.\n\nIf we knew which regime was in effect at each time step, we could simply make st a predictor variable.\n\n\nPoisson\n\nProcess\n\nFit and get predictions from a dynamic regression model\n\nm predictor variables and k states (i.e. a complete set of parameters is estimated for each state at each time step)\n\nGet the final prediction for time step, t, by calculating the expected value\n\n^y are the predictions from the observed model\nP(st = j) are the state probabilities\n\ne.g. 2 -states\nWhere each πtj is a row of the transition matrix\n\n\nUses Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or Expectation Maximization (EM) to maximize the joint probability density.\n\nEstimated parameters:\n\ntransition matrix (for each time step)\n\nDuring estimation, cells are allowed to range from -∞ to ∞, but after it’s completed, they’re normalized to [0,1] (see link)\n\nregression coefficients (for each state)\n\nUnclear to me how you estimate multiple coefficients with the same data. Maybe the likelihood for a β is maximized for a given (estimated?) transition matrix.\n\n(residual) variance (for each state)\n\nExample: Using MLE for a gaussian distribution\n\nFor a Poisson DGP\n\n\n\nExample\n\nDescription\n\nDependent variable: Personal Consumption Expenditures % Change Month over Month (M-o-M)\nIndependent variable: Consumer Sentiment index % Change Month over Month (M-o-M)\n\nModel Equation\n\n2-states\nObserved model is a linear regression\n\nModel Summary (python)\n\nTransition Matrix probabilities have pvals and CIs\np[0-&gt;0] is cell p00 and p[1-&gt;0] is cell p10 in the transition matrix\n\nunknown_cell_values = (1 - known_cell_values) for each row\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nVariance of States vs Transition Probabilities\n\nWhen Personal Consumption Expenditures are in a low variance regime, they tend to switch to a high variance regime less than 2% of the time.\nWhen Personal Consumption Expenditures are in a high variance regime, they tend to switch to a low variance regime with roughly 20% probability.\nThis variance is “sigma2” in the model summary in the Regime Parameters sections.\n\nMe: This would be the residual variance which is usually a GOF thing (i.e. variance of the points around the regression line). In finance, variance is a volatility measure and I guess this can be thought of in that way too. I guess it would the volatility around a trend line.\n\n\nSmoothed State Probabilities for each time step\n\nBottom two charts’ y-axes are probabilities, so chart 2’s dips in proability are when the hmm is in stage 1 (confirmed by looking at chart 3)\nAccessed via msdr_model_results.smoothed_marginal_probabilities[0] ([1] for state 1)\nAfter 2000, we see that often the Markov state model is in the high variance state towards the end a recession. (bottom chart)\n\n\n\n\nMarkov Switching Auto Regression (MSAR)\n\nAdds a fraction of the residual from the previous step to the MSDR model"

However, even in IRT, FIML becomes very computationally heavy as the number of factors increases.

The main difficulties with this approach are the following:\n\nNot all design variables may be known or accessible to the analyst\nToo many design variables can lead to difficulties in making inference from the expanded model\nThe expanded model may no longer be of scientific interest to the analyst\n\ndesign-based approach can provide asymptotically valid repeated sampling inferences without changing the analyst’s model.\nresampling methods, such as the jackknife and the bootstrap for survey data, can provide valid variance estimators and associated inferences on the census parameters\n\nIn other cases, it is necessary to estimate the model variance of the census parameters from the sample. The estimator of the total variance is then given by the sum of this estimator and the re-sampling variance estimator.\n\nExample: in an education study of students, schools (first stage sampling units) may be selected with probabilities proportional to school size and students (second stage units) within selected schools by stratified random sampling.\n\nsee Surveys, Sampling Methods &gt;&gt; Probabilistic Sampling Methods &gt;&gt; Multi-Stage Sampling\nAgain, ignoring the survey design and using traditional methods for multi-level models can lead to erroneous inferences in the presence of sample selection bias\n\nIn the design-based approach, estimation of variance component parameters of the model is more difficult than that of regression parameters.\n\n\nasymptotically valid even when the sample sizes within sampled clusters (level 1 units) are small, unlike some of the existing methods, but knowledge of the joint inclusion probabilities within sampled clusters is required.\n\nLarge variations in cluster sizes may cause an issue, see Lumley\n\n\nExample of debiasing a dataset by other means than by weighting by population\n\nThe economist created a death-by-covid risk probability model. They had a bunch of medical records with patient comorbidities, age, gender, positive test, hospitalized, death/no death, etc. (people with other illnesses already) and were worried that the people who tested positive but just stayed at home (i.e. no medical records like younger people). Not correcting for this bias of undetected cases would bias their risk probabilities.\n\nFailing to correct this bias would lead to underestimating the risks associated with comorbidities, and to overestimating the risks among those without listed conditions.\n\nThey used an estimated metric, national cfr per age group per gender per week (separate dataset from CDC which has stats on groups with and without medical records). When a week’s sample cfr didn’t match that week’s national cfr, they would randomly sample people in the dataset who didn’t meet the selection criteria (i.e. positive covid test) and assign them a positive test. They continued to add these reclassified people to that week’s sample until the sample cfr matched the national cfr. Thus, debiasing they’re data set.\nThought this was an interesting case because it used a estimated metric to “weight” subgroups within their sample to make it more representative of the “true” population.\n\nAlso see Projects &gt;&gt; Rolling COVID-19 CFR\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/11/how-we-built-our-covid-19-risk-estimator\n\nCeiling or floor effects occur when the tests or scales are relatively easy or difficult such that substantial proportions of individuals obtain either maximum or minimum scores and that the true extent of their abilities cannot be determined.\n\nSounds like censoring (See Regression, Other &gt;&gt; Censored and Truncated Data)\nCeiling or floor effects alone would induce, respectively, attenuation or inflation in mean estimates.

    "text": "70.2 Weights\n\nMisc\n\nSurveys responses are often biased due to coverage error, sampling error and non-response bias. Weighting is often an important step when analyzing survey data. For each unit in the sample (e.g. respondent to a survey), we attach a weight that can be understood as the approximate number of people from the target population that this respondent represents. Weights adjust the sample distribution more towards the population distribution\n\nThe green bars show the sample with weights applied.\nThe weighted average will also be less biased to the extent the response is correlated with respondent’s age.\nThe weighted distribution is not fully corrected, mainly because of bias-variance considerations\n\nPackages\n\n{{balance}} - see section below\n{CBPS} - Covariate Balancing Propensity Scores (CBPS)\n\nAlso see\n\nTypes &gt;&gt; Covariate Balancing Propensity Scores (CBPS)\n{{balance}} &gt;&gt; Steps &gt;&gt; Calculate Weights &gt;&gt; Methods\n\n\n\n\nTypes\n\nFrequency Weights\n\nSteps\n\nRemove the duplicate observations\n\nDuplicates don’t add any additional information\n\nWeight each observation by the square root of number of times it appeared in the original dataset, \nSSE needs to be divided by n - k + 1\n\nwhere n is the number of observations in the original dataset and k is the number of predictors in the regression\n\n\n\nImportance Weights - focus on how much each row of the data set should influence model estimation. These can be based on data or arbitrarily set to achieve some goal.\nAnalytic Weights - If a data point has an associated precision, analytic weighting helps a model focus on the data points with less uncertainty (such as in meta-analysis).\n(Inverse) Probability Weights (wiki) - {{balance}} refers to this type as “inverse propensity weights”\n\nAlso see below, {{balance}} &gt;&gt; Steps &gt;&gt; Adjust &gt;&gt; Options\nUsed to reduce bias when respondents have different probabilities of selection Adjusts a non-random sample to represent a population by weighting the sample units. It assumes two samples: A sample of respondents to a survey (or in a more general framework, a biased panel).\n  A sample of a target population, often referred to as \"reference sample\" or \"reference survey.\"\n      This sample includes a larger coverage of the population or a better sampling properties in a way that represents the population better.\n\n      It often includes only a limited number of covariates and doesn't include the outcome variables (the survey responses).\n\n      In different cases it can be the whole target apopulation (in case it is available), a census data (based on a survey) or an existing survey.\nPropensity Score - the probability to be included in the sample (the respondents group) conditioned on the characteristics of the unit Let pi = Pr{i ∈ S | xi} with i = 1 … n.\n  i is the unit (aka respondent), n is the total number of respondents, S is the sample of respondents\n      X is a set of covariates that are available for the sample and the target population\n\n  pi​ is the estimated probabilities of being in the sample using logistic regression\n      Data includes both sample and target population\n\n      outcome is a binary variable (1/0): 1 = Sample, 0 = Target\n\n      covariates are X\n\n  Also see [Econometrics, General](Econometrics, General) &gt;&gt; Propensity Score Matching\nCalculate Weights \n\ndi is …?\n\n\nCovariate Balancing Propensity Scores (CBPS)\n\nWhen estimating propensity score, there is often a process of adjusting the model and choosing the covariates for better covariate balancing. The goal of CBPS is to allow the researcher to avoid this iterative process and suggest an estimator that is optimizing both the propensity score and the balance of the covariates together.\nMain advantage is in cases when the researcher wants better balance on the covariates than traditional propensity score methods - because one believes the assignment model might be misspecified and would like to avoid the need to fit followup models to improve the balance of the covariates.\nAlso see\n\nMisc &gt;&gt; packages &gt;&gt; {CBPS}\n{{balance}} &gt;&gt; Steps &gt;&gt; Adjust &gt;&gt; Options\n\n\n\n{{balance}}\n\nA Python package for adjusting biased data samples.\n\nProvides eda, weights calculation, comparison of variables before and after weighting\n\nSteps:\n\nEDA:\n\nUnderstanding the initial bias in the sample data relative to a target population we would like to infer\nSummary Statistics\n\nThe limitation of using the mean is that it is not easily comparable between different variables since they may have different variances.\nASMD (Absolute Standardized Mean Deviation) measures the difference between the sample and target for each covariate.\n\nIt uses weighted average and std.dev for the calculations (e.g.: to take design weights into account).\nThis measure is the same as taking the absolute value of Cohen’s d statistic (also related to SSMD), when using the (weighted) standard deviation of the population.\n\nNot sure why it says “(weighted)” when it’s the std.dev of the population since weights are applied to sample data. Maybe the population estimate is itself a weighted calculation.\nGuidelines on effect size for Cohen’s D should apply here, too.\nFor categorical variables, the ASMD can be calculated as the average of the ASMD applied to each of the one-hot encoding of the categories of the variable\n\nAlso see\n\nPost-Hoc Analysis, general &gt;&gt; Bayesian &gt;&gt; Cohen’s D, SSMD\nPost-Hoc Analysis, Multilevel &gt;&gt; Cohen’s D\n\n\n\nVisualizations\n\nQ-Q plot (continuous)\n\nThe closer the line is to the 45-degree-line the better (i.e.: the less bias is observed in the sample as compared to the target population).\n\nBar Plots (categorical)\n\n\nCalculate Weights:\n\nAdjust the data to correct for the bias by producing weights for each unit in the sample based on propensity scores\nPreprocessing (“using best practices in the field”):\n\nTransformations are done on both the sample dataframe and the target dataframe together\nMissing values  - adds a column ‘_is_na’ to any variable that contains missing values\n\nConsidered as a separate category for the adjustment\n\nFeature Engineering\n\nContinuous - bucketed into 10 quantiles buckets.\nCategorical - rare categories (with less than 5% prevalence) are grouped together so to avoid overfitting rare events\n\n\nMethods\n\nInverse Propensity Weighting (IPW)\n\nCoefficients, parameters of the fitted models are available\nSee above, Types &gt;&gt; (Inverse) Probability Weights Using LASSO logistic regression keeps the inflation of the variance as minimal as possible while still addressing the meaningful differences in the covariates between the sample and the target\nDesign Effect (max_de) for tuning penalty factor, λ, and the trimming ratio parameter\n\nA measure of the expected impact of a sampling design on the variance of an estimator for some parameter\nmax_de=X - the regularization parameter and the trimming ratio parameter are chosen by a grid search over the 10 models with the max design effect value\n\nDefault is 1.5\nAssumption: larger design effect often implies better covariate balancing.\nWithin these 10 models, the model with the smallest ASMD is chosen.\n\nmax_de=None - optimization is performed by cross-validation of the logistic model\n\npenalty factor, λ, is chosen when the MSE is at most 1 standard error from the minimal MSE\nthe trimming ratio parameter is set by the user, and default to 20\n\n\n\nCovariate Balancing Propensity Scores (CBPS)\n\nEstimates the propensity score in a way that optimizes prediction of the probability of sample inclusion as well as the covariates balance.\nAlso see\n\nTypes &gt;&gt; Covariate Balancing Propensity Scores (CBPS)\nMisc &gt;&gt; packages &gt;&gt; {CBPS}\n\nDesign Effect (max_de)\n\na measure of the expected impact of a sampling design on the variance of an estimator for some parameter\ndefault is 1.5; If “None”, then optimization is unconstrained\n\n\nPost-Stratification\n\nPost-processing of the weights:\n\nTrims - trims the weights in order to avoid overfitting of the model and unnecessary variance inflation.\n\nOptions\n\nMean-Ratio - ratio from above according to which the weights are trimmed by mean(weights) * ratio.

It includes sampling variability, interviewer effects, frame errors, response bias, and non-response bias\n\nNon-Sampling Error\n\nSpecification error occurs when the concept implied by the survey question differs from the concept meant to be measured in the survey.\n\nOften caused by poor communication between the researcher, data analyst, or survey sponsor and the questionnaire designer.\n\nCoverage or Frame error typically results from the frame construction process. Discrepancies between the (theoretical) target population of a survey and the frame which is used to draw a sample are equivalent to statistical errors.\n\nSee Surveys, Sampling Methods &gt;&gt; Terms&gt;&gt; sampling frame\nIn practice, frames are not error-free:\n\nthey can never encompass the whole target population (because it always takes time to administrativally record an individual in a register),\nthey also contain individuals which are no longer eligible (e.g. individuals who left the country and may keep recorded in the Register several months after they left).\ncoverage errors or frame errors.\n\nExamples\n\nSome units may be omitted or duplicated an unknown number of times\nSome ineligible units may be included on the frame, such as businesses that are not farms in a farm survey.\n\n\nNonresponse error - When the reason for nonresponse is related to the missing value, parameter estimates can be biased when nonresponse is not accounted for. Includes:\n\nunit nonresponse - sampling unit does not respond to any part of the questionnaire\n\ne.g. calling a person and them choosing not to answer or participate in the the survey\n\nitem nonresponse - the questionnaire is partially completed.\n\nMeasurement error occurs when the method of obtaining the measurement affects the recorded value, often involving simultaneously the respondent, the interviewer, and the survey questionnaire.\nProcessing error refers to errors that arise during the data processing stage, including errors in the editing of the data, data encoding, the assignment of survey weights, and tabulation of the survey data.\n\nSampling Error - - caused by collecting partial information over a fraction of the population rather than the whole population itself.\n\nSampling scheme (e.g., multistage or multiple-phase sample)\nSample size\nChoice of estimator (e.g., a ratio or regression estimator, levels of post-stratification)\n\n\nKeeping sampling errors under control\n\nSurvey questionnaires must be prepared with utmost care, intensively pre-tested and field-tested in order to detect issues in question wording, routing problems or any other inconsistency\nModes of data collection must be chosen and combined judiciously in order to get most people to cooperate\nInterviewers must be carefully recruited and properly trained\nCommunication and contact strategies towards participants must be designed and adapted in order to reach highest participation."

Too generic for attitudes\n1–10; 1–7; 1–5 (or Likert scale, also see below)\n\nlabel all number or none\n\na 1–5 scale presented verbal descriptions for only the 1 and 5 endpoints and this led more people to choose the endpoints.\nA “school grade” scale is more reliable than other types of word labels\n\n\n\nOrdinal and interval scales\n\nWith ordinal, the numbers just have an intrinsic order\nWith interval, the distance between the numbers must also be equal in terms of context\n\ne.g. rating something a 2 vs 1 doesn’t mean that being a 2 is “twice as good” as being a 1\n\nunless being 5 is also twice as good as being a 4, etc.\n\n\nThere is no practical difference between ordinal or interval scales\n\nRatio Scales\n\nwhere there is a true zero and equal intervals between neighboring points. Unlike on an interval scale, a zero on a ratio scale means there is a total absence of the variable you are measuring. Length, area, and population are examples of ratio scales\n\n\nSemantic differential scales\n\n\nGather data and “interpret based on the connotative meaning of the respondent’s answer.”\nUsually have dichotomous words at either end of the spectrum\nThe more quantifiable the information is (behavior questions, for instance), the smaller the range should be.\n\nWhen you want to measure attitudes or feelings, using a 5- or 7-point semantic differential scale is a good strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n68.5.3 Likert Scale\n\nNotes from: Likert Scales: Friend or Foe?\nquantitative, rating scale\nAvoid using agree/disagree wording (see biases section below)\nExamples:\n\n5-point:\n\n[1] Strongly Disagree, [2] Disagree\n[3] (4pt removes this response) Neither Disagree Nor Agree\n[4] Agree, [5] Strongly Agree\n\n7-point:\n\n[1] Strongly disagree, [2] Disagree, [3] Somewhat disagree\n[4] Neither agree nor disagree\n[5] Somewhat agree, [6] Agree, [7] Strongly agree\n\nMore examples, Link\n\nIssues\n\nOrdinal and not Interval\n\nAnswers are not all equidistant\n\nRespondents may perceive (4) Strongly Agree and (3) Agree very similarly and thus the difference between these two options might be much smaller than the difference between (3) Agree and (2) Disagree, despite having the same distance.\n\n\nNumerical values assigned to the response options cannot be treated as interval data\n\nParametric statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation) and parametric statistical methods (e.g., summing up individual questions to find a total survey score, running a regression with survey scores) would NOT yield valid results\n\nAcceptable Analysis Methods:\n\nMedian and Mode\nOrdinal regression\nChi-Square Test of Independence\nItem Response Theory (IRT) modeling\nGraphical Tools (e.g. bar charts and correlation matrix plots)\n\n\nAdding a neutral option (i.e. Neither Disagree Nor Agree)\n\nMay increase the accuracy of survey data because respondents who do not have a strong preference may prefer to select the neutral response option, instead of randomly selecting a response option or skipping the question\nMay produce a bias: research shows that respondents often see the visual midpoint of a scale as representing the middle response option\nSolutions:\n\nuse a Likert scale that consists of an even number of response options without a neutral option\nselect survey questions for which respondents would not select the neutral option very easily.\n\n\nChoosing the number of responses\n\nResearch shows that Likert scales with 2 to 5 response options often yield precise results, although smaller numbers of response options may reduce the measurement precision of a survey\nResearchers found that there are no clear advantages of using beyond 6 response options on a Likert scale\n\nPositively and negatively worded questions together\n\nTypically used to prevent response bias\nPositively and negatively worded questions are not necessarily mirror images of each other.\n\nTherefore, when analyzing survey data, reverse-coding the Likert scale for negatively worded questions (e.g., 1-Strongly agree; 2-Agree; 3-Disagree; 4-Strongly disagree) may not necessarily put these questions in the same direction as positively worded questions\n\nResearch shows that negative wording may confuse respondents, leading to less accurate responses to the survey questions\n\nMay be increasing response bias instead of reducing it.\n\nStudies indicate that respondents are more likely to disagree with negatively worded questions than to agree with positive ones\n\nExample\n\nA respondent who would select Agree for “My room was clean” might prefer to select Strongly Disagree for “My room was dirty”.\n\n\nSolutions:\n\nKeep the number of negatively worded questions minimal, while taking the impact of negatively worded questions on responses into account.\n\n\nSliding Scales\n\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n68.5.4 Guttman Scale\n\n\nDichotomous or Likert\nGradually increases in specificity. The intent of the scale is that the person will agree with all statements up to a point and then will stop agreeing.\nThe scale may be used to determine how extreme a view is, with successive statements showing increasingly extremist positions.\nAlso, a useful tool for measuring satisfaction\nIf needed, the escalation can be concealed by using intermediate questions.\n\n\n\n68.5.5 Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nCustomer loyalty metric, 0-9 (or 1-10)\n“How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?”\nNPS = percent_promoters - percent_detractors\nResponses get broken up into 3 groups\n\nPromoters (9–10). These are your happiest and most loyal customers who are most likely to refer you to others. Use them for testimonials, affiliates, etc. These customers are key to business growth and thereby sustaining their customer experience is critical to the brand.\nPassives or Neutrals (7–8). These customers are happy but are unlikely to refer you to friends. They may be swayed to a competitor fairly easily. A business should look at ways and means of upgrading neutrals to promoters by understanding their requirements.\nDetractors (0–6). Detractors are unhappy customers who can be dangerous for your brand, spreading negative messages and reviews. Figure out their problems and fix them.\n\nAny NPS that is positive is usually perceived as good, and an NPS score of 50+ is considered excellent. The range of NPS is from -100 (all detractors) to +100 (all promoters).\n**Don’t use as a single predictor of customer loyalty**\n\nA customer might actually be very enthusiastic about the product, but they just might not ever feel the urge to recommend hemorrhoid cream to their pals\n\nCombine with other measures\n\nAsk follow-up questions.\n\nPromoters. What’s your favorite part about our product/service?\nPassives. What would make you love us?\nDetractors. What could we do to improve your experience?\n\nCombine it with user research.\n\nusability testing and other common conversion research techniques\nUser testing\nCustomer surveys\nLive chat\nHeat maps (e.g. buttons clicked on websites, scrolling actions)\n\nFind and fix issues.\n\nuse info to prioritize projects that enhance user experience\n\nMarket to promoters. Use Promoters, Passives, and Detractors as a segmentation tool.\n\nGive free stuff to “promoters” to incentize more buying or advocates to others by sharing on FB or twitter or write a review.\nFind correlations between certain product actions (heatmaps) and a higher NPS. This can help deduce what your product’s “magic moment” is when your users are truly activated and likely to derive delight from your product. Then you can focus on product optimizations to get more of your customer base to this point\n\n\nIssues\n\nresponse rate for surveys is relatively low\ntime-consuming and costly affair to collect a sizeable amount of survey data\nrelatively high-cost outlay associated with sending out surveys\nresponses are typically quantitative. There is rarely qualitative information explaining the reason for the response\n\nAlternative: Use sentiment analysis on customer reviews and social media posts to generate a proxy for NPS based on sentiment scores.\n\nSee Algorithms, Product &gt;&gt; Net Promoter Score"

In case of multi-purpose surveys, this is a major problem which generally prevents from using unequal probability sampling.\n\nAlternatively, survey statisticians use stratification as we know it always make accuracy better no matter the study variable.\n\n\n\nHansen-Hurwitz estimator has been proposed in case of sampling with replacement.\n\n\n\nCluster Sampling\n\nAssumes population has natural clusters (e.g. family unit). Different from Stratified Sampling in that the clustering characteristic(s) is the same for all clusters (between cluster variation = 0) and the within cluster variation is heterogeneous (i.e. within cluster variation != 0).\n\nExample: Family units in NYC are chosen randomly chosen. The variation between family members is whats studied.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nit’s efficient when the clusters constitute naturally formed subgroups, for which we don’t possess the list of the population\nStudying clusters can be less expensive than simple random sampling.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThe conditions of the clusters aren’t always respected. The clusters may contain similar elements.\n\n\n\n\nStratified Sampling\n\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from Chapter 3 Stratification\nThe population is classified into subpopulations, called strata, based on some categorical characteristics, such as age, gender, education\nStratified sampling buckets the population into k strata (e.g., countries), and then the experiment random samples individuals from each stratum independently.\nAssumes between group variation is not 0 (i.e. heterogeneous) and within-group variation is 0 (i.e. homogeneous)\nReasons for stratification\n\nBaseline for group A different from group B\nReason to believe the effect for group A will be different from group B\n\nAdvantages\n\nIt can be more efficient than simple random sampling\nThere is less risk of obtaining non-representative samples\n\nDisadvantages\n\nIt needs the availability of auxiliary information on the population.\nThere are strict conditions for the strata\n\n\nEstimated Total, \\(\\hat{Y}\\), for the study variable and the\nEstimated Mean of the study variable, \\(\\bar{Y}\\) (respectively)\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\hat{Y}_\\mbox{STSRS}=\\sum_{h=1}^H N_h \\bar{y}_h \\\\\n&\\hat{\\bar{Y}}_\\mbox{STSRS} = \\sum_{h=1}^H W_h \\bar{y}_h\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nAssumes SRS within each strata\n\\(N\\) is the population size\n\\(N_h\\) is the population strata size for strata, \\(h\\)\n\\(W_h\\) is the frequency weight where \\(W_h = N_h / N\\)\n\\(\\bar{y}_h\\) is the sample mean of strata, \\(h\\)\n\nVariance for Estimated Total (assuming SRS within strata)\n\\[\nV(\\hat{Y}_\\mbox{STSRS}) = \\sum_{h=1}^H N_h^2 (1-\\mbox{f}_h)\\frac{S_h^2}{n_h}\n\\]\n\n\\(n_h\\) is the sample size for stratum, \\(h\\)\nStratum Sampling Fraction: \\(\\mbox{f}_h = n_h / N_h = n/N\\) (which is just \\(\\mbox{f}\\))\n\nAssumes \\(\\mbox{f}_h\\) is the same for each strata\n\nStratum Dispersion: \\(S_h^2\\) should be similar to the sample dispersion for SRS below, except the domain of the variables is within stratum, \\(h\\) (e.g. \\(n → n_h,\\) \\(ȳ → ȳ_h\\), etc.)\n\nSample Dispersion for SRS\n\\[\ns_y^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i \\in s} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2\n\\]\n\n\nVariance for Estimated Mean (assuming SRS within strata)\n\\[\nV(\\bar{Y}_\\mbox{STSRS}) = (1 - \\mbox{f}) \\frac{s^2_h}{n_h}\n\\]\n\n\\(n_h\\) will be the same for all \\(h\\), so it’s constant in this case\nSampling Fraction: \\(\\mbox{f} = N / n\\)\n\n\\(n\\) is the overall sample size\n\nWithin-Stratum Dispersion\n\\[\nS_w^2 = \\sum_{h=1}^H W_hS_h^2\n\\]\n\n\\(S^2_h\\): See above\n\\(N\\) is the population size and \\(N_h\\) is the population strata size for strata, \\(h\\)\n\\(W_h\\) is the frequency weight where \\(W_h = N_h / N\\)\n\n\nDesign Weights: \\(d_i = N_h / n_h \\;\\;\\forall \\in s_h\\)\n\nFor SRS, design weights are equal within each stratum\n\\(s_h\\) is the set of samples within stratum, \\(h\\)\n\nStratum sample size allocation methods\n\nLet assume the overall sample size, \\(n\\), has been fixed (generally out of budgetary considerations).

That’s why in practice proportional allocation is often preferred to optimal allocation.\n\nBalanced Allocation\n\\[\n\\forall h \\;\\; n_h^\\mbox{bal} = \\frac{\\tilde{n}}{H} + (n - \\tilde{n})W_h\n\\]\n\n\\(\\tilde{n}\\) is a subsample of \\(n\\) that is equally allocated (see above) among the strata which insures minimal precision within the strata (i.e. locally)\nThe rest of the sample (\\(n-\\tilde{n}\\)) can be allocated using either proportional or optimal allocations (see above) in order to optimize accuracy for the overall sample (i.e. globally)\nBoth proportional and Neyman allocations increase sample accuracy at global level, but may happen to perform very poorly when it comes to strata (e.g. regional) level estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Stage Sampling\n\nMisc\n\nUseful when no sampling frame is available\nStages\n\nAt first-stage sampling, a sample of Primary Sampling Units (PSU) is selected using a probabilistic design (e.g. simple random sampling or other, with or without stratification)\nAt second-stage sampling, a sub-sample of Secondary Sampling Units (SSU) is selected within each PSU selected at first-stage. The selection of SSU is supposed to be independent from one PSU to another.\nAt third-stage sampling a sample of Tertiary Sampling Units can be selected with each of the SSU selected at second stage.\netc.\n\nExample: (given an absence of any frame of individuals)\n\nSelect a sample of municipalities (first-stage sampling),\nSelect a sample of neighbourhoods (second-stage sampling) within each selected municipality,\nSelect a sample of households (third-stage sampling) within each of the neighbourhoods selected a second stage\nSelect a sample of individuals (fourth-stage sampling) within each household.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nCan be more efficient than using only 1 of the sampling strategies\nCan decrease sample size if there are numerous units within strata or clusters\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nIf sampling assumptions aren’t valid, multi-stage sampling results to be less efficient than simple random sampling.\n\n\nExample: 2-stage cluster sampling\n\nAdds a second stage to cluster sampling. After clusters are chosen, units within those clusters are randomly sampled.\n\nExample: 2-Stage Stratified Sampling\n\nNotes from Two Stage Stratified Random Sampling — Clearly Explained\nUseful for when you have hierarchical strata (e.g. towns/blocks and households)\nExample: An education study of students where:\n\nSchools (first stage sampling units) may be selected with probabilities proportional to school size\nStudents (second stage units) within selected schools may be selected by stratified random sampling\n\nStage 1\n\n\n(Random?)

(bang, bang)\n\nmodifies the quoted code by inlining the value of its operand right into the blueprint\nit is evaluated before any R code is evaluated. In other words, before the code is parsed by dplyr, rlang is able to evaluate !!var, replacing it with (quoted) value.

We quote an expression and unquote it in another quoted expression. In other words, we create or capture a piece of blueprint, and insert it in another blueprint just before it’s captured by a data masking function (i.e. dplyr function). This process is also called interpolation.\npackage up the variable value to transport it inside a quoting function and then unquote it to open up the variable and us its value in a regular way\n\nTwo types of functions:\n\nevaluating - indirect references (i.e. stored value in a variable) resolved in the ordinary way and also support direct references (e.g. df$y or df[[“y”]])\nquoting - args are auto-quoted and evaluated in a special way\n\n\n# evaluating function since this works\ntemp &lt;- mtcars$am\nsum(temp)\n\n# quoting function, this doesn't work - tries to find package named \"temp\"\ntemp &lt;- \"dplyr\"\nlibrary(temp)\n# But has unquoting option, this works\nlibrary(temp, character.only = TRUE)\n# another example\ntemp &lt;- \"mtcars\"\nrm(list = temp)\n\nFor tidyverse, !! is the unquoting operator.\n\nYou can use !! to cancel the automatic quotation and supply indirect references everywhere an argument is automatically quoted. In other words, unquoting lets you open a variable and use what’s inside instead.\n\n\n\n\n73.9.2 Using non-strings for user input classes\ngrouped_mean &lt;- function(data, group_var, summary_var) {\n  # quote function args to essentially transform your function into a quoting function\n  group_var &lt;- enquo(group_var)       \n  summary_var &lt;- enquo(summary_var)\n  data %&gt;%\n    # open quoted variables inside other quoting functions\n    group_by(!!group_var) %&gt;%             \n    summarise(mean = mean(!!summary_var)) \n}\ngrouped_mean(mtcars, am, disp)\nquote and unquote pattern\n1.

    "text": "Tree-based Parzen Estimators (TPE)\n\nMisc\n\nNotes from HyperOpt Demystified\nLibraries\n\n{{hyperopt}}\n\nTypically outperforms basic bayesian optimization, but the main selling point is it handles complex hyperparameter relationships via a tree structure.\nSupports categorical variables (cat hyperparams?) which traditional Bayesian optimization does not.\n\nProcess\n\nTrain a model with several sets of randomly-selected hyperparameters, returning objective function values.\nSplit our observed objective function values into “good” and “bad” groups, according to some threshold gamma (γ).\nCalculate the “promisingness” score, which is just P(x|good) / P(x|bad).\nDetermine the hyperparameters that maximize promisingness via mixture models.\nFit our model using the hyperparameters from step 4.\nRepeat steps 2–5 until a stopping criteria.\n\nTips/Tricks\n\nHyperOpt is parallelizable via both Apache Spark and MongoDB. If you’re working with multiple cores, wether it be in the cloud or on your local machine, this can dramatically reduce runtime.\nIf you’re parallelizing the tuning process via Apache Spark, use a SparkTrialsobject for single node ML models (sklearn) and a Trails object for parallelized ML models (MLlib).\nMLflow easily integrates with HyperOpt.\nDon’t narrow down the search space too early. Some combinations of hyperparameters may be surprisingly effective.\nDefining the search space can be tricky, especially if you don’t know the functional form of your hyperparameters. However, from personal experience TPE is pretty robust to misspecification of those functional forms.\nChoosing a good objective function goes a long way. In most cases, error is not created equal. If a certain type of error is more problematic, make sure to build that logic into to your function."

    "text": "Annotation\n\nPeople love annotations (thread, paper). More text, the better.\n\nTheir takeaway from the chart is more likely to resemble the annotation if it takes the form of L2 and/or L4 and is close to the data\n\nExample: Financial Times\n\n\nTitle (L2) is used for part of the takaway message\n\nSubtitle used to describe the Y-Axis\n\nChart annotation paragraph (L4) gives contextual information\n\n\nWhen to annotate\n\na design element in your visualization that needs explaining\na data point or series that you want readers to see, like an outlier\nreaders should know something to better understand why certain data points look the way they do\n\nRemove the color key/legend and directly label your categories\n\nIf the screen is small (e.g. mobile), then it’s better to keep the legend\n\nMake it obvious which units your data uses.\n\nDon’t just put units in the description, but also in axis labels, tooltips, and annotations\n\nFor large numbers (e.g. 20 million), try to use B, M, K instead of an annotation somewhere that says something like “in thousand”\nTooltips\n\nConsider not just stating the numbers in tooltips, but also the category\n\ne.g. “3.4% unemployed” instead of “3.4%,” or “+16% revenue” instead of “+16%”\n\nUse a transparent background by setting the alpha channel of CSS background-colorto a number less than 1\n\ne.g. 0.3 using rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)\n\nWith a transparent background, text behind the tooltip can interfere with the text in the tooltip, so also apply backdrop-filter\n\nExample:\n.tooltip {\n  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);\n  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(2px);\n  backdrop-filter: blur(2px);\n}\n@media (prefers-contrast: more) {\n  .tooltip {\n    background-color: white;\n    -webkit-backdrop-filter: none;\n    backdrop-filter: none;\n  }\n}\n\nExample shows a tooltip that has an HTML class of “tooltip”.\nblur is measured in pixels and the image size varies with screen width, so the optimal blur size here may vary for you depending on the dimensions of your browser window.\n\nApplies a Gaussian blur to the target element’s background with the standard deviation specified as the argument (e.g. two pixels).\n\nAs of Mar 2023, doesn’t work on Safari, so adding -webkit-backdrop-filter allows it to work on Safari\n@media (prefers-contrast: more)checks if your user has informed their operating system or browser that they prefer increased contrast. When they do, this chunk then overrides the applied styles.\n\n\n\nTransparent backgrounds might work better with thematic maps and less with scatter plots\nDon’t center-align your text\nUse straightforward phrasings\nMove axis labels nearest the most important chart objects (e.g. bars)\n\n\nIf the higher bars are what’s most important and they’re on the right, then usea right-side axis\n\nFonts for annotation\n\n\nUse what readers are most used to (e.g. sans-serif regular, &gt;12px, (almost) black text\nIf you need to need a lot of words and they don’t fit, don’t use smaller font, use a tooltip instead\n\nOn mobile screens you can also hide the least important annotations, or move them below the visualization\n\n\nLead the eye with font sizes, styles, and colors\n\n\nThe biggest and boldest text with the highest contrast against the background should be reserved for the most important information.\n\nDon’t overdo it though\n\nUse only two levels of hierarchy that are clearly different from each other — like a 12px gray and a 14px black\nEmphasize within the annotations using boldness\n\nKeep labels horizontal\n\n\nUse a text outline\n\n\nSet the stroke around your letters, using the background color of your chart.\n\nBe conversational first and precise later"

    "text": "Color\n\nMisc\n\nWhen choosing bg and fg colors, keep in mind that it’s generally a good idea to pick colors with a similar hue but a large difference in their luminance.\nDatawrapper guide\nWhen using several subplots together to tell a story and they each have their own color scheme. Blend a color into each color scheme to produce a more unified look\n\nExample: Blending blue into a plot with green color scheme.\n\n\nBreakpoints for scales\n\nHow to choose an interpolation for your color scale\n\nCharts (see prismatic PKG to do this manipulation within ggplot)\nPalette composition methods\n\nComplimentary\n\nopposite sides of the color wheel (2 colors)\ncontrast\n\nAnalogous\n\nsame side of the color wheel (multiple)\ngradient\n\nTriadic\n\nforms triangle on the color wheel\nvibrant, contrast\n\nOthers\n\nsplit complimentary (popular)\n\nComprised of one color and two colors symmetrically placed around it. This strategy adds more variety than complementary color schemes by including three hues without being too jarring or bold. Using this method, we end up with combinations that include warm and cool hues that are more easily balanced than the complementary color schemes\n\nquadratic\n\n\nAdjustments once you chosen a color (hue) to create variations\n\nMove brightness up for lighter variations and down for darker variations\nThen, move saturation in the opposite way you moved brightness\n\nSave colors you find attractive\n\ninstant eyedropper (windows)\nThen use HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) slider for adjustments\n\nBackgrounds\n\nWhite\n\nbright, used a lot\ntry ivory or a light gray\nshades of eggshell, link\n\nAvoid black (or REALLY dark) unless situation calls for it\n\ndark is fine\n\n\nWhat to do when you have a lot of categories\n\nSimply don’t show different colors Does your chart work without colors?\n\n1 color and a discrete axis with the categories\n\nShow shades, not hues Can you make the chart less confetti-like?\n\nAlthough, consider not using shades when the parts are as or more important than the totals\n\nEmphasize Can you only use color for your most important categories?\nLabel directly Can you use the same or similar colors but label them?\nMerge categories Can you put categories together?\nGroup categories, but keep showing them Can strokes help to tell categories apart?\n\nChange the chart type Will another chart type rely less on colors?\n“Small multiply” it Can you split the categories into multiple charts? (i.e. facet by category)\nAdd other indicators Can you add symbols, patterns, line widths, or dashes?\n\n\nDoesn’t use any color — just opacity, thickness, and dotted lines.\n\nUse tooltips and hover effects Can smaller categories be hidden with them?\n\nColor scales should be chosen to best match the data values and plot type: If the goal is to show magnitude, a univariate color scheme is typically preferable, while a double-ended color scale is typically more effective when showing data that differ in sign and magnitude. Where possible, color scales should use a minimal number of hues, varying intensity or lightness of the color to show magnitude, and transitioning through neutral colors (white, light yellow) when utilizing a gradient. Cognitive load can also be reduced by selecting colors with cultural associations that match the data display, such as the use of blue for men and red (or pink) for women, or the use of blue for cold temperatures and red/orange for warm temperatures.\n\nIt is also important to consider the human perceptual system, which does not perceive hues uniformly: We can distinguish more shades of green than any other hue, and fewer shades of yellow, so green univariate color schemes will provide finer discriminability than other colors because the human perceptual system evolved to work in the natural world, where shades of green are plentiful.\n\n\nFigure above shows the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1931 color space, which maps the wavelength of a color to a physiologically based perceptual space; a significant portion of the color space is dedicated to greens and blues, while much smaller regions are dedicated to violet, red, orange, and yellow colors. This unevenness in mapping color is one reason that the multi-hued rainbow color scheme is suboptimal—the distance between points in a given color space may not be the same as the distance between points in perceptual space. As a result of the uneven mapping between color space and perceptual space, multi-hued color schemes are not recommended."

This is an improvement, but data for all those layers piles up, and your toolchain wants to embed this in your page as reams of base64 encoded text. Page file sizes are completely blowing out.\n\n\n\nUse Cases\n\nSimplification of geometry is not desirable, e.g. because of alignment issues\n\ne.g. The zoomed-in road network has to align with the road network on the basemap, so that viewers can see features that lie along sections of road.\n\nSimplification of geometry doesn’t really help, you still have too many features\nCumulatively your datasets are too large to handle.\n\nVector Tiles  - contain arrays of annotated spatial coordinate data which is combined with a separately transmitted stylesheet to produce the tile image.\n\ni.e. The edges of the roads, the boundaries of buildings etc. Not an image, but the building blocks for one\nDifferent stylesheets can use the same vector data to produce radically different looking maps that either highlight or omit data with certain attributes\nMapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) - specification; the de-facto standard for vector tile files\n\nstored as a Google protocol buffer - a tightly packed binary format.\n\n\nMBTiles - by Mapbox; describe a method of storing an entire MVT tileset inside a single file.\n\nInternally .mbtiles files are SQLlite databases containing two tables: metadata and tiles.\n\ntiles table\n\nindexed by z,x,y\ncontains a tile_data column for the vector tile protocol buffers, which are compressed using gzip\n\n\nSQLite format and gzip compression help with efficient retrieval and transmission\n\nUsing vector tiles we can have unlimited reference layers. Each one contributes nothing to the report file size since it is only streamed on demand when required.\nWorkflow to convert data to .tbtiles\n\nIn R, read source data as an sf, and wrangle\n\nTippecanoe expects by epsg 4326 by default\n\nWrite data out to geojson\nOn the command line, convert geojson to .mbtiles using the tippecanoe command line utility.\n\nTippecanoe sources\n\nMapbox version - repo\n\nMcBain says, he uses this version and hasn’t had any problems\nREADME has helpful cookbook section\n\nActively maintained community forked version - repo\nMay be a headache to get dependencies if using Windows\n\nAlternatively it can output a folder structure full of protocol buffer files.\n\nExample\ntippecanoe -zg \\\n          -o abs_mesh_blocks.mbtiles \\\n          --coalesce-densest-as-needed \\\n          --extend-zooms-if-still-dropping \\\n          mb_shapes.geojson\n\nMapping\n\nExample\nlibrary(mvtview)\nlibrary(rdeck)\n\n# Fire up the server\nserve_mvt(\"abs_mesh_blocks.mbtiles\", port = 8765)\n# Serving your tile data from http://0.0.0.0:8765/abs_mesh_blocks.json.\n# Run clean_mvt() to remove all server sessions.\n\nmesh_blocks &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(\"http://0.0.0.0:8765/abs_mesh_blocks.json\")\n\n# Map the data\nrdeck(\n    initial_bounds = structure(meshblocks$bounds, crs = 4326, class = \"bbox\") # set map limits using the tilejson\n) |&gt;\n  add_mvt_layer(\n    data = rdeck::tile_json(\"http://0.0.0.0:8765/abs_mesh_blocks.json\"),\n    get_fill_color = scale_color_linear(\n      random_attribute\n    ),\n    opacity = 0.6\n  )\n\nSee McBain article for options on hosting .mbtiles files\nRegarding “abs_mesh_blocks”: {mvtview} provides a way to fetch the metadata table from .mbtiles as json by querying a json file with the same name as the .mbitles file.\nThe structure of ‘tilejson’ is yet another specification created by Mapbox, and is supported in deck.gl (and therefore {rdeck}) to describe tile endpoints."

The hexabins better represent the close race by removing the distorting element which is the geographical size of the provinces.\nEach voting district (hexabin) is voting for 1 representative and has the same number of voters, but districts can have vastly different areas depending on population density.\n\nKeep unit at constant size (like hexabins) but alter hex shape to keep state shape.\n\n\nA better U.S. house election results map?\nResults\n\nstate size depends on number of districts which depends on population and therefore correctly conveys voting results visually across the whole country\nDistricts get distorted but the states retain their shape and so distortion of the overall visualization is minimized\n\n\n\n\nUber’s H3 grid system -\n\nMisc\n\nPackages: {h3r}, {h3-r}\ndocs\nAdd census data to H3 hexagons, calculate overlaps (article)\nFor large areas, you can reduce the number of hexagons by merging some hexagons into larger hexagons.\n\nReduces storage size\nIssue: leaves small gaps between hexagons\n\nmight not matter for your use case\n\nSolution: use Microsoft’s Quadkeys approach (see article)\n\n\nEach hexagon has a series of smaller hexagons that sit (mostly) inside of another, which creates a hierarchy that can be used for consistent referencing and analysis, all the way down to lengths of 2 feet for the edges.\n“Hexagons were an important choice because people in a city are often in motion, and hexagons minimize the quantization error introduced when users move through a city. Hexagons also allow us to approximate radiuses easily.”\nRe other shapes: “We could use postal code areas, but such areas have unusual shapes and sizes which are not helpful for analysis, and are subject to change for reasons entirely unrelated to what we would use them for. Zones could also be drawn by Uber operations teams based on their knowledge of the city, but such zones require frequent updating as cities change and often define the edges of areas arbitrarily”\nGrid systems can have comparable shapes and sizes across the cities that Uber operates in and are not subject to arbitrary changes. While grid systems do not align to streets and neighborhoods in cities, they can be used to efficiently represent neighborhoods by clustering grid cells. Clustering can be done using objective functions, producing shapes much more useful for analysis. Determining membership of a cluster is as efficient as a set lookup operation.\n16 Resolutions\n\n0 - 15 (0 being coarsest and 15 being finest)\nEach finer resolution has cells with one seventh the area of the coarser resolution. Hexagons cannot be perfectly subdivided into seven hexagons, so the finer cells are only approximately contained within a parent cell.\nThe identifiers for these child cells can be easily truncated to find their ancestor cell at a coarser resolution, enabling efficient indexing. Because the children cells are only approximately contained, the truncation process produces a fixed amount of shape distortion. This distortion is only present when performing truncation of a cell identifier; when indexing locations at a specific resolution, the cell boundaries are exact.\nWant a resolution granular enough to introduce variability and wide enough to capture the effects of an area\nExample of resolution 6 in Iowa"

They often lead to degeneracy.\n\nNAs for standard error estimates are a good indication of degeneracy.\nSince ERGMs don’t handle triads well, it is NOT recommended using “triangle” as an adjustment variable in your model\n\n\n\nGoal: Describe the local selection forces that shape the global structure of a network\nExamples of networks examined using ERGM include knowledge networks, organizational networks, colleague networks, social media networks, and networks of scientific development.\nThe basic principle underlying the method is comparison of an observed network to Exponential Random Graphs.\n\nThe Null Hypothesis is a Erdos-Renyi graph\n\nA random graph where the degree of any node is binomially distributed (with n-1 Bernoulli trials per node, for a directed graph). (n is the number of nodes)\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\n\\text{logit}(Y_{ij} = 1 \\; | \\; y_{ij}^c) = \\theta^T \\delta (y_{ij})\n\\]\n\n\\(\\theta\\) is a vector of coefficients\n\\(y_{ij}\\) denotes ijth dyad in graph \\(y\\)\n\nIf \\(y_{ij} = 1\\), then i and j are connected by an edge.\nIf \\(y_{ij} = 0\\), then i and j are NOT connected by an edge.\n\\(y_{ij}^c\\) is the complement (i.e. all other pairs of vertices in \\(y\\) other than (i, j)).\n\n\\(\\delta(y_{ij})\\) is the change statistic. A measure of how the graph statistic \\(g(y)\\) changes if the ijth vertex is toggled on or off.\n\n\\(\\delta(y_{ij}) = g(y_{ij}^+) - g(y_{ij}^-)\\)\n\\(y_{ij}^+\\) is the same network as \\(y\\) except that \\(y_{ij} = 1\\).\n\\(y_{ij}^-\\) is the same network as \\(y\\) except that \\(y_{ij} = 0\\).\n\n\nExample:{statnet} Edges model\nbottmodel.01 &lt;- ergm(bott[[4]] ~ edges)\n\n## Evaluating log-likelihood at the estimate.\nsummary(bottmodel.01)\n## \n## ==========================\n## Summary of model fit\n## ==========================\n## \n## Formula:   bott[[4]] ~ edges\n## \n## Iterations:  4 out of 20 \n## \n## Monte Carlo MLE Results:\n##       Estimate Std.

We might expect that older children are more likely to be role models to others. To test this hypothesis, we can use the directed variants of nodecov(): nodeocov() (effect of an attribute on out-degree) and nodeicov() (effect of an attribute on in-degree). We note that the nodecov() group of terms are for numeric attributes; nodefactor() terms are available for categorical attributes.\nbottmodel.03b &lt;- ergm(bott[[4]]~edges+nodeicov('age.month'))\n\nsummary(bottmodel.03b)\n## \n## ==========================\n## Summary of model fit\n## ==========================\n## \n## Formula:   bott[[4]] ~ edges + nodeicov(\"age.month\")\n## \n## Iterations:  4 out of 20 \n## \n## Monte Carlo MLE Results:\n##                    Estimate Std.

They assume that close-by nodes are similar without actually using the node features to confirm this assumption.\n\nThey rely on a fixed mapping from node to embedding (i.e. this is a transductive method).\n\nFor dynamic graphs, where new nodes and edges may be added, the algorithm must be re-ran from scratch, and all node embeddings need to be recalculated. In real-world problems, this is quite a big issue, as most online platforms have new users signing up every day, and new edges being created constantly."

    "text": "Misc\n\nNotes from:\n\nnyhackr meet-up Video\nVignette: PSAgraphics: An R Package to Support Propensity Score Analysis\nBook: Applied Propensity Score Analysis in R (unfinished)\n\nAny classification model should be able to produce propensity scores.\n\nExamples (code): Logistic Regression, Bayesian Logistic Regression, Probit BART, Conditional Inference Trees (partykit), Decision Trees, Random Forest.\n\nIf two people have similar propensity scores, then they will be similar in all the values of the covariates that were used to create that score\npsa::psa_simulation_shiny - App that simulates and visualizes balance of groups according effect size, sample size, estimand (e.g ATE, ATT, etc.), and PSA method\nProcess\n\n\nPhase 1\n\nSelect covariates\n\nTypically whatever variables are available if it’s a secondhand dataset\nIf running and experiment, collect data that will demonstrate baseline equivalence (?), which can later be used in a PSA\n\nChoose PSA method\nCheck Balance (i.e. do observations in treatment and control look equivalent)\nRepeat if necessary until sufficient balance is achieved\n\nPhase 2\n\nEstimate Treatment Effects\n\nPhase 3\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nTest how sensitive the results are to an unobserved confounder\n\ni.e. How much variance would a variable need to have before it changes the results (sign change or just significance?)\n\n\nGo back to Phase I and choose a different method\n\nTests how sensitive the results are to the PSA method chosen\n\n\n\nMethods:\n\nStratification - Treatment and Comparison (aka Control) units are divided into strata (or subclasses) based upon a propensity score (e.g. quantiles), so that treated and comparison units are similar within each strata.\n\nLogistic Regression (treatment/control ~ covariates) can be used to estimate scores (i.e. predicted logits)\n\nlr.out &lt;- \n  glm(\n  treatment ~ x1 + x2 + x3,\n  data = dat,\n  family = binomial(link = logit)\n  )\ndat$ps &lt;- fitted(lr.out)\n\n5 stratum removes &gt; 90% of the bias in estimated treatment effect (Cochran 1968)\nbreaks5 &lt;- psa::get_strata_breaks(dat$ps)\ndat$strata5 &lt;-\n  cut(\n    x = dat$ps,\n    breaks = breaks5$breaks,\n    include.lowest = TRUE,\n    labels = breaks5$labels$strata\n  )\nWith Regression, each strata has very similar numbers of observations.\nTrees, strata are determined by the leaf nodes and each strata generally differs in the numbers of observations.\n\nIn a decision tree example, strata had some funky proportions in relation to the categorical and continuous predictors (see Paper)\n\nWithin each stratum, independent sample t-tests are conducted and then pooled to provide an overall estimate\n\nMatching - Each treatment unit is paired with a comparison unit base upon the pre-treatment covariates\n\nAlgorithms\n\nPropensity Score Matching\nLimited Exact Matching\nFull Matching\nNearest Neighbor Matching\nOptimal/Generic Matching\nMahalanobis distance matching (quantitative covariates only)\nMatching with and without replacement\nOne-to-One or One-to-Many Matching\n\nChoice of algorithm is trial and error — whichever one gives the best balance.\nDependent sample tests (e.g. repeated mearsures, t-test w/paired = TRUE) are conducted using the match pairs.\nExample:\ndata(lalonde, package = \"Matching\")\nrr &lt;- \n  Matching::Match(\n    Y = lalonde$re78, \n    Tr = lalonde$treat, \n    X = lalonde$ps, \n    M = 1,\n    estimand = 'ATT',\n    ties = FALSE)\nsummary(rr)\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Estimate...  2579.8 \n#&gt; SE.........  637.69 \n#&gt; T-stat.....  4.0456 \n#&gt; p.val......  5.2189e-05 \n#? \n#&gt; Original number of observations..............  445 \n#&gt; Original number of treated obs...............  185 \n#&gt; Matched number of observations...............  185 \n#&gt; Matched number of observations  (unweighted).  185\n\nX: Variables to match on or PS\nM: how many matches per unit that you want where 1 is a 1:1 match between treatment and control\n\nFor imbalanced data, you’d want set to something higher depending on the level of imbalance between treatment and control groups.\nFor values greater than 1, units get used more than once which may not be accepted in some fields.\n\nties: For units that have multiple matches, TRUE means that the matched dataset will include the multiple control group matches with weights that reflect it (see docs for more details). FALSE means one of the multiple matches is chosen at random.\nestimand: ATE and ATC also available; Value printed in the results as Estimate.\n\nDependent Sample Assessment Plot\n\nmatches &lt;- data.frame(Treat = lalonde[rr$index.treated,'re78'],\n                      Control = lalonde[rr$index.control,'re78'])\ngranovagg::granovagg.ds(\n  matches[,c('Control','Treat')], \n  xlab = 'Treat', \n  ylab = 'Control')\n\n{granovagg} is a ggplot extension of {granova}. The package has been archived on CRAN and the github has broken links and no documentation.\nVery similar characteristics and interpretation as the Propensity Score Assessment Plot except instead of the circles which represented strata, each dot represents a matched pair between treatment and control. (Also a different color scheme)\nThe purple CI bar is difficult to spot since it’s very short, but it stradles the green dashed ATE line and doesn’t include the diagonal (i.e. zero).\n\nBalance Assessment\n\nlalonde_formu &lt;- treat ~ age + I(age^2) + educ + I(educ^2) + black +\n    hisp + married + nodegr + re74  + I(re74^2) + re75 + I(re75^2)\npsa::MatchBalance(df = lalonde, \n                  formu = lalonde_formu,\n                  formu.Y = update.formula(lalonde_formu, \n                                           re78 ~ .),\n                  M = 1, \n                  estimand = 'ATT', \n                  ties = FALSE) |&gt; \n  plot()\n\nCurrently this package doesn’t have a website or CRAN docs. See Matching::Match above for details on some of these arguments or see the R script or ?psa::MatchBalance if you have it installed.\nCharts\n\nTop Left: For 2% of the matched pairs, they only matched on 12% of the covariates.\n\nThe percent annotation was cut-off on his chart but it very likely says 88%. Since the y-axis in “% unmatched”, the percent matched is 12%.\n\nBottom-Left: A breakdown of the unmatched covariates for each individual matched pair. Each column is a matched pair. Each colored segment in that column represents unmatched covariate. Each row is a covariate which is labelled in the bar graph at the bottom-right.\n\nThe first matched pair was unmatched on the covariates: nodegr, black, re74, and hisp\nSome of the segments have a light coloring instead of dark and I’m not sure what that means.\n\nBottom-Right: The aggregated unmatched percentage for each covariate across all matched pairs\nTop-Right: Standardized Estimate for each covariate. A variable that’s CI doesn’t include 0 indicates an imbalance. (e.g. nodegr)\n\nEstimate is the mean difference from a paired t-test function that’s been standardized by dividing the estimate by the sd of the variable over the whole sample (i.e. treatment and control groups).\nUsing paired because the units have been matched.\nSo if the data has been perfectly matched for a variable, the mean difference between the treatment units and control units should be 0.\nA CI of this estimate that includes 0 means that the variable is balanced.\n\n\nYou can apply Partial Exact Matching to try bring any imbalanced variables into balance. This method allows you to be able to specify variables that want to guarantee that units to be matched upon. Doing this affects the matching upon other variables though. So, a variable that was matched before might not still be matched after using this method.\n\npsa::MatchBalance(df = lalonde, \n                  formu = lalonde_formu,\n                  formu.Y = update.formula(lalonde_formu, \n                                           re78 ~ .),\n                  M = 1, \n                  estimand = 'ATT', \n                  ties = FALSE,\n                  exact.covs = c('nodegr')) |&gt; \n  plot()\n\nYou can see nodegr has been fixed in the Top-Right error-bar chart. It also appears this has brought re75 into balance as well while not throwing the rest of the variables out of balance.\nThe x-axis range has narrowed which gives the appearance that the error bars have widened, but I don’t think they have.\n\n\n\nWeighting - Each observation is weighted by the inverse of probability of being in that group\n\nPropensity Scores are used as weights for the regression model that you’ll use to perform your analysis.\n\nThe specific weights will depend on the estimand (e.g ATE, ATT, etc.)\n\nAverage Treatment Effect (ATE): \\(\\text{ATE} = E(Y_1 - Y_0|X) = E(Y_1|X) - E(Y_0|X)\\)\n\nWeight: \\(w_{\\text{ATE}} = \\frac{Z_i}{\\pi_i} + \\frac{1-Z_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\)\n\\(Z_i = 1\\) says the unit is in the treatment group\n\\(\\pi_i\\) is the propensity score for unit i\nExample:\ndat &lt;- \n  dat |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    ate_weights = psa::calculate_ps_weights(treatment, \n                                            ps, \n                                            estimand = \"ATE\"))\n\n# via {psa}\npsa::treatment_effect(\n  treatment = dat$treatment,\n  outcome = dat$outcome,\n  weights = dat$ate_weights\n)\n# via lm\nlm(outcome ~ treatment,\n   data = dat,\n   weights = dat$ate_weights)\n\nATE Among the Treated (ATT): \\(\\text{ATT} = E(Y_1 - Y_0|X,C = 1) = E(Y_1|X,C = 1) - E(Y_)|X,C = 1)\\)\n\nWeight: \\(w_{\\text{ATT}} = \\frac{\\pi_i Z_i}{\\pi_i} + \\frac{\\pi_i(1-Z_i)}{1-\\pi_i}\\)\nExample:\ndat &lt;- \n  dat |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    att_weights = psa::calculate_ps_weights(treatment, \n                                            ps, \n                                            estimand = \"ATT\"))\n\n# via {psa}\npsa::treatment_effect(\n  treatment = dat$treatment,\n  outcome = dat$outcome,\n  weights = dat$att_weights\n)\n# via lm\nlm(outcome ~ treatment,\n   data = dat,\n   weights = dat$att_weights)\n\nATE Among the Control (ATC): \\(\\text{ATC} = E(Y_1- Y_0|X = 0) = E(Y_1|X = 0) - E(Y_0|X = 0)\\)\n\nWeight: \\(w_{\\text{ATC}} = \\frac{(1-\\pi_i)Z_i}{\\pi_i} + \\frac{(1-e_i)(1-Z_i)}{1-\\pi_i}\\)\nNot certain what \\(e_i\\) is, but it might be the residual for the unit from the propensity score model.\nExample: Same as above except with ATC weights\n\nATE Among the Evenly Matched (ATM): \\(\\text{ATM}_d = E(Y_1 - Y_0|M_d = 1)\\)\n\nWeight: \\(w_{\\text{ATM}} = \\frac{\\min\\{\\pi_i, 1-\\pi_i\\}}{Z_i \\pi_i(1-Z_i)(1-\\pi_i)}\\)\nExample: Same as above except with ADM weights\n\nShows mirrored axis histogram with PS on x-axis and count on y-axis; guessing treatment/control are top/bottom histograms?\nTreament Effect for Weighting\n\\[\n\\text{TE} = \\frac{\\sum Y_iZ_i}{\\sum Z_i w_i} - \\frac{Y_i(1-Z_i)w_i}{\\sum(1-Z_i)w_i}\n\\]\n\nThis formula is an alternative to using the weights in a model to estimate the effect.\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\nDistribution of propensity scores\n\nggplot(dat) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    data = dat[dat$treatment == 1, ],\n    aes(x = ps, y = after_stat(count)),\n    bins = 50,\n    fill = cols[2]\n  ) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    data = dat[dat$treatment == 0, ],\n    aes(x = ps, y = -after_stat(count)),\n    bins = 50,\n    fill = cols[3]\n  ) +\n  geom_hline(\n    yintercept = 0,\n    lwd = 0.5\n  ) + \n  scale_y_continuous(lable = abs)\n\nTreatment above and Control below\n\nCovariate Balance Plot\n\nPSAgraphics::cv.bal.psa(\n  dat[, 1:3],\n  data$treatment,\n  dat$ps,\n  strata = 5\n)\n\nAbsolute standardized Covariate effect sizes with (blue) and without (red) PS adjustment\nWant blue dots close to zero which says that after PS adjustment, the covariates have little predictive power in determining whether a unit is in the treatment group or control group. It means the PS are effectively adjusting for the selection bias of the treatment/control “assignment” in the observational data.\n\nBoxplot by Propensity Score Strata by Treatment\n\nPSAgraphics::box.psa(\n  continuous = dat$x2,\n  treatment = dat$treatment,\n  strata = dat$strata5\n)\n\nFor a continuous predictor, it allows you to visually examine the balance produced by the PS strata by comparing the distributions between treatment and control within each strata\nConnected dots are the means within each distribution and numbers below each box are its sample size.\n\nSetting trim = 0.5 will connect medians. (Range of trim is from 0 to 0.5)\n\nWithin strata, the more similar the distributions between treatment and control, the better the balance. Balance should be assessed for each predictor.\nTrends or patterns between strata can hint at potential variation and may help explain effects detected in the later performed analysis\n\nUnits in higher strata (i.e. higher PS) are more likely to be treated than those in lower strata, so looking at the values of predictor, you can say whether those with higher or lower values of the predictor are more likely to be treated.\n\nWith balance = TRUE (default is FALSE),\n\nHistogram\n\nPermuted data are randomly assigned to strata, absolute differences of means calculated within each strata, and the differences summed to produce the statistic.\nRepeated until there’s a distribution which is then visualized as a histogram\nThe sum of the mean differences of the original data is represented by a red dot.\nThe further left the red dot is from the mean (or median with trim = 0.5) of the permuation distribution, the better the balance\n\ni.e. the smaller the sum of mean differences of the original data as compared the permuted distribution of sums of mean differences, the better.\nThe rank shows where the original data statistic ranks in comparison to all of the summed differences in the permuted distribution.\n\nTotal_number_of_ranks = number_of_permutations + 1 (aka original data)\n\n\n\nBoxplot\n\nP-Values for KS-tests on treatment and control distributions are placed above the sample sizes of each strata. A lack of balance for a given strata would be indicated by a p-value &lt; 0.05.\n\n\n\nStacked Bar Chart by Propensity Score Strata by Treatment\n\nPSAgraphics::cat.psa(\n  categorical = dat$x3,\n  treatment = dat$treatment,\n  strata = dat$strat5\n)\n\nFor a categorical predictor, it allows you to visually examine the balance produced by the PS strata by comparing the category proportions between treatment and control within each strata\nWithin each strata, side-by-side segmented bars can be used to compare proportions of cases in each category\nSample sizes are above each bar\nif subsequent analysis indicates large differences in size or direction of effects for different strata, then comparing covariate distributions across strata may give an initial indication of potential causes.\nWith balance = TRUE (default is FALSE), it’s very similar to box.psa.\n\nHistogram\n\nUnits within each category are permuted between strata\nDifferences in proportions is used instead of difference in means\nInterpretation is the same\n\nFisher’s Exact Tests are performed and the p-values are shown at the bottom of the bars for each strata. A lack of balance for a given strata would be indicated by a p-value &lt; 0.05.\n\n\nPropensity Score Assessment Plot\n\nstrata5 &lt;- cut(lalonde$ps, \n               quantile(lalonde$ps, seq(0, 1, 1/5)), \n               include.lowest = TRUE, \n               labels = letters[1:5])\ncirc.psa(lalonde$re78, \n         lalonde$treat, \n         strata5)\n\nWhen differences in outcomes between treatments vary across strata, the investigator may want to learn how these differences are related to changes in covariate distributions within the strata.\nDisplays contributions of individual strata to the overall effect, weighing contributions of individual strata according to the relative sizes of the respective strata. The overall effect is plotted as a heavy dashed diagonal line that runs parallel to the identity diagonal.\nThe x-axis is the response values when treatment = 0, and the y-axis is the response values when treatment = 1. Labels depend on the values of the treatment variable.\nCircles\n\nEach circle represents a stratum, and the sizes of circles vary according to their respective sample sizes.\nThe center of each stratum’s circle corresponds to outcome means for the respective control and treatment groups for that stratum.\n\nThe Crosses represent the difference in response means between treatment and control.\nThe blue dashed line is the mean of the differences between the strata which is the ATE, and the green line is its 95%CI.\n\nCIs that span the diagonal means no significant effect.\nCIs become increasingly unreliable for larger values of the trim arg.\n\nThe vertical and horizontal dashed red lines represent the (weighted) response means for the control and treatment groups respectively.\nInterpretation\n\nCircles/Crosses that fall on the diagonal means that those strata do not have a treatment effect.\nCircles on the lower side of diagonal black line show that the corresponding x-axis (e.g. treatment = 0) mean for that strata is larger than the y-axis (e.g. treatment = 1) mean for that stratum\nCircles close proximity to one another on the same side of the diagonal indicates concordance of outcome values in these strata\nCircles far outside of the cluster of circles should be investigated via the other predictor charts above to see what characteristics make-up that particular strata. If the sizes of each strata aren’t relatively balanced, then a strata with few units may present outside the cluster. It may be useful try a larger amount of strata to see how that affects the outlier circle as it may help narrow the strata profile.\nThe distance of the crosses from the diagonal represents the size of estimated effect. A stratum with a much larger effect would influence the ATE (blue line) more strongly.\n\n\nLOESS Plot\n\npsa::loess_plot(\n  ps = psadf[psadf$Y &lt; 30000,]$ps, \n  outcome = psadf[psadf$Y &lt; 30000,]$Y, \n  treatment = as.logical(psadf[psadf$Y &lt; 30000,]$Tr))\n\nIncludes:\n\nTop: PS density plots for treatment and control. Looking to make sure there’s substantial overlap of the two densities.\nRight: Density plot of the outcome variable by treatment variable. Example shows significant skew and should be logged.\nCenter: LOESS plot\n\nParallel lines would indicate that there is a treatment effect, and it is homogeneous (i.e. same for all units) across all propensity scores which is not often the case.\n\nAn important feature of PSA in detecting heterogeneous, or uneven, treatments based upon different “profiles.”\n\nI think a profile would be kind of like a latent variable description of a cluster, but in this case, clusters are strata determined by the propensity scores. Profiles can be built by looking at the predictor vs propensity score strata charts above.\n\n\nCan be used to find strata boundarys. Potential boundaries are indicated where the treatment and control lines narrow or cross. Spaces between the lines are where you can expect a treatment effect.\n\ne.g. Setting int = c(0.375, 0.55, 0.875, 1) says that 0.357 and 1 are the minimum and maximum propensity scores and 0.55 and 0.875 are scores where the loess lines narrow or cross. This would represent 3 strata: (0.375, 0.55], (0.55, 0.875], and (0.875, 1].\nSeems like this would be highly dependent on the parameters of the LOESS parameters that are set unless you have a lot of data.\n\n\nStratification Plot\n\npsa::stratification_plot(ps = psadf$ps,\n                         treatment = psadf$Tr,\n                         outcome = psadf$Y,\n                         n_strata = 5)\n\nInstead of assuming a continuous vector of propensity scores as with the LOESS, it visualizes the mean differences in the response variable for each strata\nEssentially a visualization of an independent t-test."

Maybe he’s talking about the package used in his example.\n\nSelection Bias Ratio\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\frac{O_a}{O_b} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi_a}{1-\\pi_a}}{\\frac{\\pi_b}{1-\\pi_b}}\n\\]\n\nThe ratio of the odds of the treated unit being in the treated group to the odds of the control unit being in the control group\nConverting Gamma to probability\nExamples\n\nIn smoking studies, the ratio is around 6 which means the results are very robust to unobserved confounders. Anything around 1 is considered sensitive to confounders.\nFor Social Science studies, it’s typically between 1 and 2.\n\nConverting to the probability of 1 unit of the matched pair being treated\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\Gamma + 1} \\leq p_a, p_b \\leq \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\Gamma + 1}\n\\]\n\n\\(p_a\\) is the probability of a unit in group \\(a\\) being treated.\n\\(\\Gamma = 1 \\quad \\longrightarrow \\quad p_a =0.5 \\;\\&\\; p_b = 0.5\\) which means each unit is equally likely to get treated\n\\(0.5 \\leq \\Gamma \\leq 2 \\quad \\longrightarrow \\quad 0.33 \\leq p_a, p_b \\leq 0.66\\) which means no unit can be more than twice as likely as its match to get treated\n\\(0.33 \\leq \\Gamma \\leq 3 \\quad \\longrightarrow \\quad 0.25 \\leq p_a,p_b \\leq 0.75\\) which means no unit can be more than three times as likely as its match to get treated.\n\n\nWilcoxon Signed Rank Test\n\nUsed in the sensitivity test to determine which level of \\(\\Gamma\\) will produce a non-significant treatment effect.\nSteps\n\nDrop matched pairs that have the same outcome value\nCalculate the difference in outcome value between each matched pair\nRank the absolute differences from smallest (1) to largest (N)\nCalculate W\n\\[\nW = \\left|\\; \\sum_1^N \\operatorname{sgn} (x_{T,i} - x_{C,i}) \\cdot R_i \\; \\right|\n\\]\n\n\\(N\\) is the number of ranked pairs\n\\(R_i\\) is the Rank for pair \\(i\\)\n\\(x_{T,i}\\) and \\(x_{C,i}\\) are the outcome values for each unit of pair \\(i\\)\n\n\n\nExample:\nrbounds::psens(x = lalonde$re78[rr$index.treated], \n               y = lalonde$re78[rr$index.control],\n               Gamma = 2, \n               GammaInc = 0.1)\n\n#&gt; \n#&gt;  Rosenbaum Sensitivity Test for Wilcoxon Signed Rank P-Value \n#&gt;  \n#&gt; Unconfounded estimate ....  2e-04 \n#&gt; \n#&gt;  Gamma Lower bound Upper bound\n#&gt;    1.0       2e-04      0.0002\n#&gt;    1.1       0e+00      0.0016\n#&gt;    1.2       0e+00      0.0069\n#&gt;    1.3       0e+00      0.0215\n#&gt;    1.4       0e+00      0.0527\n\n{rbounds} performs Rosenbaum Bounds Sensitivity Tests for Matched and Unmatched Data. Also has functions for IV models and 2x2 contingency tables.\n\nThere is another function for continuous/ordinal outcomes called hlsens which uses the Hodges-Lehman point estimate. After reading the wiki, the output of this function seems to be a median difference or effect size for a given Gamma, but I’m not sure how that’s supposed to be interpreted in this context.\nFor binary outcomes, use binarysens. The x and y args say to use counts of discrepant pairs. This means counts where the treatment group and control groups have different outcomes. So in the 2x2 table, that’s the counts in cells (1,2) and (2,1)\n\nBryer’s slides say to use McNemar’s test, but after looking at the code, I don’t see how Gamma can be incorporated into that test.\n\n\nArguments\n\nx: Treatment group outcome values ordered by matched pairs\ny: Control group outcome values ordered by matched pairs\nGamma: Largest value of Gamma that you want to test\nGammaInc: Increment value of Gamma.\n\nThe Lower bound and Upper bound are a sort of CI for the Wilcoxon test’s p-values\nLook for the value of Gamma that would nullify a significant treatment effect in your analysis.\n\ne.g. \\(\\Gamma = 1.4\\) (since it’s Upper bound value is &gt; 0.05) says that a confounder that adds 40% more variance in explaining the outcome would result in a Wilcoxon Test that doesn’t reject the Null Hypothesis (i.e. no significant treatment effect).\n\n\nBootstrapping\n\nWith bootstrapping, you can check the sensitivity to model choice.\nSampling with replacement is done for the treatment and control observations is done separately\nFor each bootstrap sample balance statistics and treatment effects are estimated using each method (five by default). Overall treatment effect with confidence interval is estimated from the bootstrap samples\nExample\nlalonde_formu &lt;- treat ~ age + I(age^2) + educ + I(educ^2) + black +\n    hisp + married + nodegr + re74  + I(re74^2) + re75 + I(re75^2)\npsaboot &lt;- \n  PSAboot::PSAboot(Tr = lalonde$treat,\n                   Y = lalonde$re78,\n                   X = lalonde,\n                   formu = lalonde_formu)\nsummary(psaboot)\n#&gt; Stratification Results:\n#&gt;    Complete estimate = 1658\n#&gt;    Complete CI = [242, 3074]\n#&gt;    Bootstrap pooled estimate = 1476\n#&gt;    Bootstrap weighted pooled estimate = 1461\n#&gt;    Bootstrap pooled CI = [66.5, 2885]\n#&gt;    59% of bootstrap samples have confidence intervals that do not span zero.\n#&gt;       59% positive.\n#&gt;       0% negative.\n#&gt; ctree Results:\n#&gt;    Complete estimate = 1598\n#&gt;    Complete CI = [-6.62, 3203]\n#&gt;    Bootstrap pooled estimate = 1465\n#&gt;    Bootstrap weighted pooled estimate = 1472\n#&gt;    Bootstrap pooled CI = [172, 2758]\n#&gt;    38.1% of bootstrap samples have confidence intervals that do not span zero.\n#&gt;       38.1% positive.\n#&gt;       0% negative.\n#... etc for the other methods\n\nBy default, PSAboot uses logistic regression (i.e. boot.strata) {partykit::ctree} (See Algorithms, ML &gt;&gt; Trees &gt;&gt; Distributional Trees/Forests), {rpart} (decision trees), {Matching}, and {MatchIt}, but boot.weighting is also available by manually specifying the functions through the methods argument.\ncontrol.ratio and treat.ratio arguments allow for undersampling in the case of imbalanced data\nDefault parallel = TRUE, M = 100. Also has a seed argument. Watch your RAM for large values of M, because I don’t think there’s any garbage collection in his code.\n\nBalance Plot\n\n\nMetric: Average Balance (mean difference/sd(strata) for strata or sd(N) for matching) across all covariates\nUnadjusted (red): No propensity score adjustment\nComplete (blue): Propensity scores used but no bootstrapping\nPooled (black): Propensity scores and bootstrapped\n\nSo the distribution is made-up “blue” measurements calculated from bootstrap resamples. Then, the black line is the mean of that distribution\n\nThe red and blue estimates seem to the same as the ones in the Covariate Balance Plot (PSAgraphics::cv.bal.psa)\nInterpretation: The weighting method is the most balanced.\n\nBox Plot\n\nPSAboot::boxplot(psaboot)\n\nFrom the Bryer video, I assume this is a boxplot version of the balance plot with the same interpretation of each color (black, red, and blue) except that since the input isn’t a balance object, these are unstandardized mean differences? (note x-axis).\n\nI’m confused as to why Weighting is no longer the best method (i.e. closest to zero) though.\n\nThere currently isn’t any sufficient documentation to make certain of estimate or the green lines, but I think the green lines look like averages of the whiskers.\n\nCorrelation Between Boot Distributions\n\nPSAboot::matrixplot(psaboot)\n\n{rpart} shows the least relationship with the other methods.\n\n\n\nMultinomial\n\nSteps\n\nEstimate three separate propensity score models for each pair of groups (i.e. Control-to-Treat1, Control-to-Treat2, Treat1-to-Treat2).\nDetermine the matching order. The default is to start with the largest of two treatments, then the other treatment, followed by the control.\nFor each unit in group 1, find all units from group 2 within a certain threshold (i.e. difference between PSs is within a specified caliper).\nFor each unit in group 2, find all units from group 3 within a certain threshold.\nCalculate the distance (difference) between each unit 3 found and the original unit 1. Eliminate candidates that exceed the caliper.\nCalculate a total distance (sum of the three distances) and retain the smallest unique M group 1 units (by default M=2)\n\nPS estimated from multiple logistic regression models. One for each combination of of categories of the treatment variable (e.g. treatment_1 ~ control, treatment_2 ~ control, treatment_1 ~ treatment_2)\nFinds matched triplets that minimize the total distance (i.e. sum of the standardized distance between propensity scores within the three models). within a caliper.\nProvides multiple methods for determining which matched triplets are retained:\n\nOptimal: which attempts to retain all treatment units.\nFull: which retains all matched triplets within the specified caliper (.25 by default as suggested by Rosenbaum).\nAnalog of the one-to-many for matched triplets. Specify how many times each treat1 and treat2 unit can be matched.\nUnique which allows each unit to be matched once, and only once.\n\nFunctions for conducting repeated measures ANOVA and Freidman Ranksum Tests are provided."

    "text": "14.8 Predictive Accuracy\n\nMisc\n\nSee Statistical Rethinking, Chapter 7for details\nloo package website has some nice CV workflows\n\nAlso ensembling, time series\n\nDon’t compare models with different numbers of observations (SR, Ch 11)\n\ne.g. 1/0 logistic regression model vs aggregated logistic regression model\n\nPSIS-LOO (IS-LOO, WAIC, etc) has difficulties if each observation has their own parameter(s) (aka “random effects”) (Vehtari thread + post)\n\nModel Comparison\n\nMcElreath: To judge whether two models are “easy to distinguish” (i.e. kinda like whether their scores are statistically different), we look at the differences between the model with the best WAIC and the WAICs of the other models along with the standard error of the difference of the WAIC scores\n\nbrms::loo_compare(loo_obj, loo_obj)\n\nWhere a “loo_obj” is a brms::loo(fit) or brms::waic(fit) object\nCan also take a list of loo objects\nsimplify = FALSE gives a more detailed summary\n\nIf the difference in ELPD is much larger or several times the estimated standard error of the difference, then the top model is expected to have better predictive performance\n\n\nPareto-Smoothed Importance Sampling Cross-Validation (PSIS)\n\nWeights observations based on influence on the posterior\nUses highly influential observations to formulate a pareto distribution and sample from it\nbrms::loo - wrappers for loo::loo (docs)\nEstimates out-of-sample LOO-CV lppd\n\nloo pkg\n\n“elpd_loo” - larger is better\n“looic” - is just (-2 * elpd_loo) to convert it to the deviance scale, therefore smaller is better\nMay need to use add_criterion(brms_fit, \"loo\") in order to use the loo function\n\nRethinking pkg: smaller is better\n\nThe shape parameter of the distribution, k, is estimated. When k &gt; 0.5, then the distribution has infinite variance. PSIS weights perform well as long as k &lt; 0.7. Large k values can be used to identify influential observations (i.e. rare observations/potential outliers).\n\nFor brms, warnings for high k values will show when using add_criterion(brms_mod, \"loo\") \nOutliers make it tough to estimate out-of-sample accuracy, since rare values are unlikely to be in the new sample. (i.e. overfitting risk)\nAlso, warnings about high k values can occur when the sample size is small\n\nWhen looking at the posterior, keep in mind that “influential” data values might be significantly affecting the posterior distribution.\n\nSolutions\n\nIf there are only a few outliers, and you are sure to report results both with and without them, dropping outliers might be okay.\nIf there are several outliers, then a form of Robust Regression can be used or a Mixture Model.\n\nCommon to use a Student’s T distribution instead of a Gaussian for the outcome variable specification\n\nThe Student-t distribution arises from a mixture of Gaussian distributions with different variances. If the variances are diverse, then the tails can be quite thick.\nHas an extra shape parameter, ν, that controls how thick the tails are.\n\nν = ∞ is a Gaussian distribution\nAs v –&gt; 1+ , tails start becoming fat\nν can be estimated with very large datasets that have plenty of rare events\n\n\n\n\nExample\n# shows k values for all data points below 0.5 threshold\nloo::loo(b8.3) %&gt;% \n  plot()\n# K values\ntibble(k = b8.3$criteria$loo$diagnostics$pareto_k, \n      row = 1:170) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(k))\n# k value diagnostic table - shows how many are points have bad k values and that group's min n_eff\nloo(b8.3) %&gt;% loo::pareto_k_table()\n\n\nWidely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC)\n\nDeviance with a penalty term based on the variance of the outcome variable’s observation-level log-probabilities from the posterior\nEstimates out-of-sample deviance\n\n{loo}: brms::waic\n\n“elpd_waic”: larger is better\n“waic”: is just (-2 * elpd_waic) to convert it to deviance scale, therefore smaller is better\nMay need to use add_criterion(brms_fit, \"waic\") in order to use the waic function\n\nRethinking pkg: smaller is better\n\nEffective number of parameters, pwaic (aka the penalty term or overfitting penalty)\n\nSays compute the variance in log-probabilities for each observation i, and then sum up these variances to get the total penalty.\nCalled such because in ordinary linear regressions the sum of all penalty terms from all points tends to be equal to the number of free parameters in the model\n\nWhen the sum is larger than the number of free parameters, it can indicate an outlier is present which will increase the overfitting risk.\n\nSee Solutions for outliers under PSIS &gt;&gt; Shape parameter, k\n\n\nWeights\n\nThese weights can be a quick way to see how big the differences are among models.\nEach model weight is essentially a proportion of it’s WAIC or PSIS difference compared to the total of all the WAIC or PSIS differences.\n\nLarger is better\n\nExample\nbrms::model_weights(b8.1b, b8.2, b8.3, weights = \"loo\") %&gt;%\n        round(digits = 2)\n## b8.1b  b8.2  b8.3 \n##  0.00  0.03  0.97\n\nInterpretation:\n\nb8.3 has more than 95% of the model weight. That’s very strong support for including the interaction effect, if prediction is our goal.\nThe modicum of weight given to b8.2 suggests that the posterior means for the slopes in b8.3 are a little overfit.\n\n\n\nBayes Factor\n\nThe ratio (or difference when logged) of the average likelihoods (the denominator of bayes theorem) of two models.\nSince the average likelihood has been averaged over the priors, it has a natural penalty for more complex models\nProblems\n\nEven when priors are weak and have little influence on posterior distributions within models, priors can have a huge impact on comparisons between models.\nNot always possible to compute the average likelihood"

    "text": "Predictive Accuracy\n\nMisc\n\nSee Statistical Rethinking, Chapter 7 for details\nloo package website has some nice CV workflows\n\nAlso ensembling, time series\n\nDon’t compare models with different numbers of observations (SR, Ch 11)\n\ne.g. 1/0 logistic regression model vs aggregated logistic regression model\n\nPSIS-LOO (IS-LOO, WAIC, etc) has difficulties if each observation has their own parameter(s) (aka “random effects”) (Vehtari thread + post)\n\nModel Comparison\n\nMcElreath: To judge whether two models are “easy to distinguish” (i.e. kinda like whether their scores are statistically different), we look at the differences between the model with the best WAIC and the WAICs of the other models along with the standard error of the difference of the WAIC scores\n\nbrms::loo_compare(loo_obj, loo_obj)\n\nWhere a “loo_obj” is a brms::loo(fit) or brms::waic(fit) object\nCan also take a list of loo objects\nsimplify = FALSE gives a more detailed summary\n\nIf the difference in ELPD is much larger or several times the estimated standard error of the difference, then the top model is expected to have better predictive performance\n\n\nPareto-Smoothed Importance Sampling Cross-Validation (PSIS)\n\nWeights observations based on influence on the posterior\nUses highly influential observations to formulate a pareto distribution and sample from it\nbrms::loo - wrappers for loo::loo (docs)\nEstimates out-of-sample LOO-CV lppd\n\n{loo}\n\n“elpd_loo” - Larger is better\n“looic” - is just (-2 * elpd_loo) to convert it to the deviance scale, therefore smaller is better\nMay need to use add_criterion(brms_fit, \"loo\") in order to use the loo function\n\n{Rethinking}: Smaller is better\n\nThe shape parameter of the distribution, k, is estimated. When k &gt; 0.5, then the distribution has infinite variance. PSIS weights perform well as long as k &lt; 0.7. Large k values can be used to identify influential observations (i.e. rare observations/potential outliers).\n\nFor brms, warnings for high k values will show when using add_criterion(brms_mod, \"loo\") \nOutliers make it tough to estimate out-of-sample accuracy, since rare values are unlikely to be in the new sample. (i.e. overfitting risk)\nAlso, warnings about high k values can occur when the sample size is small\n\nWhen looking at the posterior, keep in mind that “influential” data values might be significantly affecting the posterior distribution.\n\nSolutions\n\nIf there are only a few outliers, and you are sure to report results both with and without them, dropping outliers might be okay.\nIf there are several outliers, then a form of Robust Regression can be used or a Mixture Model.\n\nCommon to use a Student’s T distribution instead of a Gaussian for the outcome variable specification\n\nThe Student-t distribution arises from a mixture of Gaussian distributions with different variances. If the variances are diverse, then the tails can be quite thick.\nHas an extra shape parameter, ν, that controls how thick the tails are.\n\nν = ∞ is a Gaussian distribution\nAs v –&gt; 1+ , tails start becoming fat\nν can be estimated with very large datasets that have plenty of rare events\n\n\n\n\nExample\n# shows k values for all data points below 0.5 threshold\nloo::loo(b8.3) %&gt;% \n  plot()\n# K values\ntibble(k = b8.3$criteria$loo$diagnostics$pareto_k, \n      row = 1:170) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(k))\n# k value diagnostic table - shows how many are points have bad k values and that group's min n_eff\nloo(b8.3) %&gt;% loo::pareto_k_table()\n\n\nWidely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC)\n\nDeviance with a penalty term based on the variance of the outcome variable’s observation-level log-probabilities from the posterior\nEstimates out-of-sample deviance\n\n{loo}: brms::waic\n\n“elpd_waic”: Larger is better\n“waic”: is just (-2 * elpd_waic) to convert it to deviance scale, therefore smaller is better\nMay need to use add_criterion(brms_fit, \"waic\") in order to use the waic function\n\n{Rethinking}: Smaller is better\n\nEffective number of parameters, pwaic (aka the penalty term or overfitting penalty)\n\nSays compute the variance in log-probabilities for each observation i, and then sum up these variances to get the total penalty.\nCalled such because in ordinary linear regressions the sum of all penalty terms from all points tends to be equal to the number of free parameters in the model\n\nWhen the sum is larger than the number of free parameters, it can indicate an outlier is present which will increase the overfitting risk.\n\nSee Solutions for outliers under PSIS &gt;&gt; Shape parameter, k\n\n\nWeights\n\nThese weights can be a quick way to see how big the differences are among models.\nEach model weight is essentially a proportion of it’s WAIC or PSIS difference compared to the total of all the WAIC or PSIS differences.\n\nLarger is better\n\nExample\nbrms::model_weights(b8.1b, b8.2, b8.3, weights = \"loo\") %&gt;%\n        round(digits = 2)\n## b8.1b  b8.2  b8.3 \n##  0.00  0.03  0.97\n\nInterpretation:\n\nb8.3 has more than 95% of the model weight. That’s very strong support for including the interaction effect, if prediction is our goal.\nThe modicum of weight given to b8.2 suggests that the posterior means for the slopes in b8.3 are a little overfit.\n\n\n\nBayes Factor\n\nThe ratio (or difference when logged) of the average likelihoods (the denominator of bayes theorem) of two models.\nSince the average likelihood has been averaged over the priors, it has a natural penalty for more complex models\nProblems\n\nEven when priors are weak and have little influence on posterior distributions within models, priors can have a huge impact on comparisons between models.\nNot always possible to compute the average likelihood"
