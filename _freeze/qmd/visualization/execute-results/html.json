Still, this is something to be mindful of, and a reason to use svg() if exactness of the rendered text is of prime importance\n    -   File size will be dramatically smaller\n\n## Layout {#sec-vis-layout .unnumbered}\n\n-   Facetting vs Single Graph\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.2.png)\n-   Layout based on experiement design\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.3.png)\n-   align title ALL the way to the left (ggplot: plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n-   remove legends\n    -   use colored text in title (ggtext)\n    -   label points or lines\n    -   last resort: place legend underneath title/subtitle\n-   grid lines\n    -   remove if possible\n    -   sparse and faint if needed\n-   axis labels\n    -   remove if obvious (e.g brands of cars)\n    -   create a title that informs about the axis labels\n    -   should always be horizontal\n        -   flip axis, don't angle them 45 degrees\n-   text\n    -   left-align most text\n    -   can center a subtitle if it helps with making the graph more symmetrical\n    -   some labels can be right-aligned\n-   Remove all borders\n-   Maximize white space\n    -   don't cram visuals together\n-   Working memory. A cognitive limitation that affects plot comprehension is the limit on working memory. Typically, working memory is limited to approximately seven (plus or minus two) items, or chunks. In practice, this means that categorical scales with more than seven categories decrease readability, increase comprehension time, and require significant attentional resources, because it is not possible to hold the legend mapping in working memory.\n-   The use of redundant aesthetics that activate the same gestalt principles (such as color and shape in a scatter plot, which both activate similarity) results in higher identification of corresponding data features. In addition, dual encoding increases the accessibility of a chart to individuals who have impaired color vision or perceptual processing (e.g., dyslexia, dysgraphia). This experimental evidence directly contradicts the guidelines popularized by Tufte (1991), which suggest the elimination of any feature that is not dedicated to representing the core data, including redundant encoding and other unnecessary graphical elements.\n\n## Aspect Ratio {#sec-vis-ar .unnumbered}\n\n-   Misc\n    -   Golden Rectangle\n\n        ````\n\n        ::: {.cell fig.asp='1.618'}\n        \n        :::\n\n        ````\n-   Twitter\n    -   Video: 1105 x 1920\n-   Line Charts\n    -   Matters most if two different line charts are being compared\n        -   The core idea of \"banking\" is that the slopes in a line chart are most readable if they average to 45°.\n        -   Use `ggthemes::bank_slopes(x, y, method = c(\"ms\", \"as\"))`\n            -   2 methods (that req. no optimization) from Jeer, Maneesh who followed Cleveland's 45° guideline\n            -   [docs](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/reference/bank_slopes.html)\n        -   \"The problem with banking is that sometimes you need the chart in a certain aspect ratio to fit into a page layout. Especially if banking produces portrait sized charts. But why not let the optimal chart ratio define your layout? For instance, you can put the additional information to the side of the chart. Remember that the main goal of banking is to increase the readability of the line slopes. In the following example, the slopes for Nuclear and Renewables would have been much more difficult to see, if the chart would have been 'squeezed' to a landscape aspect.\" ([article](https://www.vis4.net/blog/2012/06/doing-the-line-charts-right/))\\\n            ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.16.png)\n\n## Typography {#sec-vis-typo .unnumbered}\n\n-   CSS Length Units\n\n    -   Absolute Lengths\n\n        |      |                              |\n        |------|------------------------------|\n        | cm   | centimeters                  |\n        | mm   | millimeters                  |\n        | in   | inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm) |\n        | px\\* | pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in) |\n        | pt   | points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)   |\n        | pc   | picas (1pc = 12 pt)          |\n\n        : \\* Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device.

More text, the better.\n    -   Their takeaway from the chart is more likely to resemble the annotation if it takes the form of L2 and/or L4 and is close to the data\\\n        ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.11.png)\n    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Financial Times\\\n        ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.12.png)\n        -   Title (L2) is used for part of the takaway message\n            -   Subtitle used to describe the Y-Axis\n        -   Chart annotation paragraph (L4) gives contextual information\n-   When to annotate\n    -   a design element in your visualization that needs explaining\n    -   a data point or series that you want readers to see, like an outlier\n    -   readers should know something to better understand why certain data points look the way they do\n-   Remove the color key/legend and directly label your categories\n    -   If the screen is small (e.g. mobile), then it's better to keep the legend\n-   Make it obvious which units your data uses.\n    -   Don't just put units in the description, but also in axis labels, tooltips, and annotations\n-   For large numbers (e.g. 20 million), try to use B, M, K instead of an annotation somewhere that says something like \"in thousand\"\n-   Tooltips\n    -   Consider not just stating the numbers in tooltips, but also the category\n        -   e.g. \"3.4% unemployed\" instead of \"3.4%,\" or \"+16% revenue\" instead of \"+16%\"\n    -   Use a transparent background by setting the alpha channel of CSS `background-color`to a number less than 1\n        -   e.g. 0.3 using `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)`\n    -   With a transparent background, text behind the tooltip can interfere with the text in the tooltip, so also apply `backdrop-filter`\n        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}:\n\n            ``` css\n            .tooltip {\n              background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3);\n              -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(2px);\n              backdrop-filter: blur(2px);\n            }\n            @media (prefers-contrast: more) {\n              .tooltip {\n                background-color: white;\n                -webkit-backdrop-filter: none;\n                backdrop-filter: none;\n              }\n            }\n            ```\n\n            -   Example shows a tooltip that has an HTML class of \"tooltip\".\n\n            -   `blur` is measured in pixels and the image size varies with screen width, so the optimal blur size here may vary for you depending on the dimensions of your browser window.\n\n                -   Applies a Gaussian blur to the target element's background with the standard deviation specified as the argument (e.g. two pixels).\n\n            -   As of Mar 2023, doesn't work on Safari, so adding `-webkit-backdrop-filter` allows it to work on Safari\n\n            -   `@media (prefers-contrast: more)`checks if your user has informed their operating system or browser that they prefer increased contrast. When they do, this chunk then overrides the applied styles.\n-   Transparent backgrounds might work better with thematic maps and less with scatter plots\n-   Don't center-align your text\n-   Use straightforward phrasings\n-   Move axis labels nearest the most important chart objects (e.g. bars)\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.4.png){width=\"524\"}\n    -   If the higher bars are what's most important and they're on the right, then usea right-side axis\n-   Fonts for annotation\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.5.png){width=\"524\"}\n    -   Use what readers are most used to (e.g. sans-serif regular, \\>12px, (almost) black text\n    -   If you need to need a lot of words and they don't fit, don't use smaller font, use a tooltip instead\n        -   On mobile screens you can also hide the least important annotations, or move them below the visualization\n-   Lead the eye with font sizes, styles, and colors\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.6.png){width=\"524\"}\n    -   The biggest and boldest text with the highest contrast against the background should be reserved for the most important information.\n        -   Don't overdo it though\n    -   Use only two levels of hierarchy that are clearly different from each other --- like a 12px gray and a 14px black\n    -   Emphasize within the annotations using boldness\n-   Keep labels horizontal\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.8.png){width=\"524\"}\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.7.png){width=\"524\"}\n-   Use a text outline\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.9.png){width=\"524\"}\n    -   Set the stroke around your letters, using the background color of your chart.\n-   Be conversational first and precise later\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/image.10.png)\n\n## Color {#sec-vis-color .unnumbered}\n\n-   Misc\n    -   When choosing bg and fg colors, keep in mind that it's generally a good idea to pick colors with a similar hue but a large difference in their luminance.\n    -   Datawrapper [guide](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colors-for-data-vis-style-guides/)\n    -   When using several subplots together to tell a story and they each have their own color scheme. Blend a color into each color scheme to produce a more unified look\n        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Blending blue into a plot with green color scheme.![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/FPsEiqSXMAMopMQ.jpeg){width=\"394\"}\n-   Breakpoints for scales\n    -   [How to choose an interpolation for your color scale](https://blog.datawrapper.de/interpolation-for-color-scales-and-maps/)\n-   Charts (see prismatic PKG to do this manipulation within ggplot)\n-   Palette composition methods\n    -   Complimentary\n        -   opposite sides of the color wheel (2 colors)\n        -   contrast\n    -   Analogous\n        -   same side of the color wheel (multiple)\n        -   gradient\n    -   Triadic\n        -   forms triangle on the color wheel\n        -   vibrant, contrast\n    -   Others\n        -   split complimentary (popular)\n            -   Comprised of one color and two colors symmetrically placed around it. This strategy adds more variety than complementary color schemes by including three hues without being too jarring or bold. Using this method, we end up with combinations that include warm and cool hues that are more easily balanced than the complementary color schemes\n        -   quadratic\n-   Adjustments once you chosen a color (hue) to create variations\n    1.  Move brightness *up* for lighter variations and *down* for darker variations\n    2.  Then, move saturation in the opposite way you moved brightness\n-   Save colors you find attractive\n    -   instant eyedropper (windows)\n    -   Then use HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) slider for adjustments\n-   Backgrounds\n    -   White\n        -   bright, used a lot\n        -   try ivory or a light gray\n        -   shades of eggshell, [link](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/41698)\n    -   Avoid black (or REALLY dark) unless situation calls for it\n        -   dark is fine\n-   What to do when you have a lot of categories\n    -   Simply don't show different colors Does your chart work without colors?\n        -   1 color and a discrete axis with the categories\n    -   Show shades, not hues Can you make the chart less confetti-like?\n        -   Although, consider not using shades when the parts are as or more important than the totals\n    -   Emphasize Can you only use color for your most important categories?\n    -   Label directly Can you use the same or similar colors but label them?\n    -   Merge categories Can you put categories together?\n    -   Group categories, but keep showing them Can strokes help to tell categories apart?\\\n        ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/Screenshot-2022-02-10-at-15.png){width=\"524\"}\n    -   Change the chart type Will another chart type rely less on colors?\n    -   \"Small multiply\" it Can you split the categories into multiple charts? (i.e. facet by category)\n    -   Add other indicators Can you add symbols, patterns, line widths, or dashes?\\\n        ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/Screenshot-2022-02-10-at-15.1.png)\n        -   Doesn't use any color --- just opacity, thickness, and dotted lines.\n    -   Use tooltips and hover effects Can smaller categories be hidden with them?\n-   Color scales should be chosen to best match the data values and plot type: If the goal is to show magnitude, a univariate color scheme is typically preferable, while a double-ended color scale is typically more effective when showing data that differ in sign and magnitude. Where possible, color scales should use a minimal number of hues, varying intensity or lightness of the color to show magnitude, and transitioning through neutral colors (white, light yellow) when utilizing a gradient. Cognitive load can also be reduced by selecting colors with cultural associations that match the data display, such as the use of blue for men and red (or pink) for women, or the use of blue for cold temperatures and red/orange for warm temperatures.\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/unknown_filename.gif)\n-   It is also important to consider the human perceptual system, which does not perceive hues uniformly: We can distinguish more shades of green than any other hue, and fewer shades of yellow, so green univariate color schemes will provide finer discriminability than other colors because the human perceptual system evolved to work in the natural world, where shades of green are plentiful.\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/unknown_filename.1.gif)\n    -   Figure above shows the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1931 color space, which maps the wavelength of a color to a physiologically based perceptual space; a significant portion of the color space is dedicated to greens and blues, while much smaller regions are dedicated to violet, red, orange, and yellow colors. This unevenness in mapping color is one reason that the multi-hued rainbow color scheme is suboptimal---the distance between points in a given color space may not be the same as the distance between points in perceptual space. As a result of the uneven mapping between color space and perceptual space, multi-hued color schemes are not recommended.\n\n## Maps {#sec-vis-maps .unnumbered}\n\n-   above rules also apply\n-   Remove as many extraneous elements as possible\n    -

  Dark background: lighter color on the value of interest (usually the higher value) (bottom left)\n-   Try not to use Rainbow palettes, because they are misleading\n    -   (acceptable) rainbow called \"Turbo\" if you need one ([article](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html?m=1))![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/FTBj4rfWUAE8rZq.jpeg){width=\"496\"}\n        -   [Code](https://gist.github.com/mikhailov-work/ee72ba4191942acecc03fe6da94fc73f) - see comments for links to R scripts and improved versions of Turbo\n\n## Area {#sec-vis-area .unnumbered}\n\n-   In general, these charts aren't good for noisy data and data with many categories\n    -   Have issues when values increase sharply (see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK2SnhEu_hg). around 50:13)\n-   Experiment with the order of the groups\n    -   Events that you're looking for are probably only visable when there's a particular order\n    -   Most of the time, putting the most stable groups at the bottom produces the best results\n\n## Time Series {#sec-vis-ts}\n\n-   Horizon Charts\n    -   especially useful for showing data with large amplitudes in a short vertical space\n\n## Uncertainty {#sec-vis-uncert .unnumbered}\n\n-   Translate **percentages into counts** (e.g. \"a 1 out of 5 chance\" rather than \"a 20% chance\")![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/Screenshot%20(787).png){width=\"615\"}\n    -   [{riskyr}]{style=\"color: #990000\"} - icon arrays and less sophisticated viz for the above chart\n\n    -   icon arrays\n\n        -   Examples\n            -   base rates and error rates ([paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/remco-chang/InfoVis2015-Bayes.pdf))\n            -   relative risks ([paper](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2099767_6/component/file_2562291/content))\n\n    -   Waffle plots are similar to icon arrays\n-   **quantile dotplots**\n    -   [{]{style=\"color: #990000\"}[ggdist](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/articles/dotsinterval.html){style=\"color: #990000\"}[}]{style=\"color: #990000\"} (many examples and flavors)\n-   **hypothetical outcome plots**\n    -   Consists of multiple individual plots (frames), each of which depicts one draw from a distribution (use case for animation)\n    -   Best suited for multivariate judgments like how reliable a perceived difference between two random variables is\n    -   Illustration of the process![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/1-YWsxZceM5RyhRYvdQUBbUw.png)\n        -   You create a distribution to sample from or using known distribution and parameters or bootstrapping the sample and sample from each bootstrap.\n        -   Each sample/draw is presented on the right side of the distribution plot (fig 1) (final product)\n            -   I think it would be better if after each draw the previous draw remained but was de-emphasized (i.e. turned light gray)\n            -   Another example would McElreath's lecture video on posterior prediction distribution.\n        -   Figs 2 and 3 show a sequence of draws from a joint distribution of uncorrelated variables (fig 2) and correlated variables (fig 3)\n    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: NYT on interpreting jobs reports![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/Screenshot%20(789).png){width=\"449\"}![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/Screenshot%20(790).png){width=\"449\"}\n        -   2 facets: accelerating job growth (left), steady job growth (right)\n        -   For each facet,\n            -   the left plot is static, and the right plot is animated showing different noisy samples of the same underlying dgp\n            -   the left plot shows what normals perceive the distribution to look like for the given interpretation (e.g. accelerating job growth), and the right plot shows what real (i.e. noisy) data with the same interpretion looks like.\n    -   \n-   **Fan charts**\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/Screenshot%20(785).png)\n    -   shows a 90% interval broken divided into 30% increments (left) or 10% increments (right)\n-   **Show previous forecasts**\\\n    ![](./_resources/Visualization.resources/Screenshot%20(792).png){width=\"435\"}\n    -   Truth is in dark blue with light blue branches showing previous forecasts\n\n## Mobile {#sec-vis-mob .unnumbered}\n\n-   Misc\n\n    -   RStudio plots are displayed in 96 dpi and `ggsave` uses 300 dpi as default\n        -   i.e. viewed plots won't look the same as the saved plots using default settings\n\n-   Use sharp color contrasts when highlighting\n\n-   Minimal readable size is 16, but 22 is recommended\n\n-   Aspect ratio of 4:3 or 1024 x 768 pixels\n\n    -   Another article say 1:2\n\n-   Bar Charts should be horizontal to make charts with many categories readable\n\n    -   Mobile screens are more tall than wide so labels on the y-axis makes more sense than on the x-axis\n\n-   R\n\n    -   Set-up external window with aspect ratio (e.g. 1:2)\n\n        ``` r\n        dev.new(width=1080, height=2160, unit=\"px\", noRStudioGD = TRUE)\n        ```\n\n        -   noRStudioGD = TRUE says any new plots appear in the new graphics window rather than the RStudio graphics device\n        -   Can also use windows(), x11(), or png() from [{ragg}]{style=\"color: #990000\"}\n\n-   Use Quarto (or Rmd) for developement\n\n    ``` markdown\n    #| dpi: 300     \n    #| fig.height: 7.2     \n    #| fig.width: 3.6     \n    #| dev: \"png\"     \n    #| echo: false     \n    #| warning: false     \n    #| message: false`\n    ```\n\n    -   This way your dpi and aspect ratio are set and you can view the final output without having to save the png and viewing it separately to see how it looks\n    -   `fig.height` and `fig.width` are always given in inches\n\n-   If you haven't set your Quarto document to be `self-contained`, then the images have also already been saved for you - probably in a folder called `documentname_files/figure-html/`\n",
