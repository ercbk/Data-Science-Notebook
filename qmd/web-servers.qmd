    -   Heiss [guide](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2024/01/12/diy-api-plumber-quarto-ojs/_book/deploying.html#the-super-easy-way) on setting up a caddy server on a Digital Ocean droplet with Docker and [{plumber}]{style="color: #990000"}
    -   hrbrmstr [thread](https://mastodon.social/@hrbrmstr/115435866700482403) on scanning your network for compromised IPs and other assets
        -   [greynoise tool](https://check.labs.greynoise.io/) checks to see if your IP is being used by botnets
        -   [runZero](https://www.runzero.com/)
            -   Scans your local networks and profiles your external IP.
            -   You start w/a free trial, but get moved to a free community edition for small businesses and personal use after the trial ends.
            -   You login using your email. Then just follow the Getting Started steps
            -   Notes
                -   Downloaded an "explorer"
                -   Scan
                    -   Ran an initial scan on my home network.
                    -   The default was to send a 1000 packets/sec which (when I started it) said that it could take 4 hrs. I decided to try 3000 packets. This made my internet unusable, caused my VPN to restart (and not with the right settings). Going to try a 1000 and shutdown everything VPN related and see if that works.
        -   [ShieldsUp](https://www.grc.com/shieldsup)
            -   Provides internet security vulnerability profiling services (seems similar to runZero).

-   Hosting files with basic security ([Thread](https://fosstodon.org/@wronglang@bayes.club/113294094603241847))

    -   Host a http server and use randomized path for hosting things you want to not make completely public.
    -   Turn off directory listings for the directory with the randomized paths
        -   They're secure until someone shares a link outside of the group you want to have it.
    -   If you want to set up "basic auth" you can have a slightly awkward username/password setup.

-   Differences between caddy and nginx (ChatGPT 3.5)

    -   Configuration:
        -   Nginx uses a complex, block-based configuration language, which can be challenging for beginners.
        -   Caddy uses a simpler, declarative configuration file called the Caddyfile.
    -   Automatic HTTPS:
        -   Nginx requires manual configuration for HTTPS and certificate management.
        -   Caddy automatically obtains and manages TLS certificates, making it easier to secure your website.
    -   Plugins:
        -   Nginx has a vast ecosystem of third-party modules, but adding these can increase complexity.
        -   Caddy has built-in modules for common tasks like logging, rate limiting, and authentication, reducing reliance on external tools.
    -   Performance:
        -   Both are performant, but benchmarks often show Caddy with a slight edge in low-resource situations.
    -   Ease of use:
        -   Caddy is generally considered easier to learn and use due to its simpler configuration and focus on automation.
        -   Nginx has a steeper learning curve but offers more control for experienced users.

-   Harrell on the benefits of Netlify vs AWS ([source](https://www.fharrell.com/post/web/))

    -   "... when you have to support your own Linux or Windows web server such as an AWS Lightsail instance, the time spent in keeping the site secure and software updated is significant, and doing updates to web pages is not as easy as the local `~/web`Â Netlify mirroring approach. It is far easier to host a static web site where Netlify takes care of 100% of system and web server software issues. There is nothing to update on your site other than the actual web content."

    | [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_com/index.html#gitlabcom-specific-rate-limits) | X,000 requests/min | Lots of nuances, somewhat confusing |
    | [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) | 100GB | Pay for more |
    | [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=4) | 100 GB | Credit card required, just in case... but apparently Amazon is very forgiving of accidental overages |
