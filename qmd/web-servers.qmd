-   Differences between caddy and nginx (ChatGPT 3.5)
    -   Configuration:
        -   Nginx uses a complex, block-based configuration language, which can be challenging for beginners.

        -   Caddy uses a simpler, declarative configuration file called the Caddyfile.
    -   Automatic HTTPS:
        -   Nginx requires manual configuration for HTTPS and certificate management.

        -   Caddy automatically obtains and manages TLS certificates, making it easier to secure your website.
    -   Plugins:
        -   Nginx has a vast ecosystem of third-party modules, but adding these can increase complexity.

        -   Caddy has built-in modules for common tasks like logging, rate limiting, and authentication, reducing reliance on external tools.
    -   Performance:
        -   Both are performant, but benchmarks often show Caddy with a slight edge in low-resource situations.
    -   Ease of use:
        -   Caddy is generally considered easier to learn and use due to its simpler configuration and focus on automation.

        -   Nginx has a steeper learning curve but offers more control for experienced users.
