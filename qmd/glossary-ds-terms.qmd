-   [**HTE**]{style="color: #009499"} - Heterogeneous Treatment Effect - Also called differential treatment effect, includes difference of means, odds ratios, and Hazard ratios for time-to-event outcome vars

    -   Ascertaining subpopulations for which a treatment is most beneficial (or harmful) is an important goal of many clinical trials.

Avoids overoptimistic estimates of the efficacy of an intervention resulting from the removal of non-compliers by accepting that noncompliance and protocol deviations are likely to occur in actual clinical practice. So mimics likely situation in the real world, but not good for estimating the causal effect of a treatment.

It is used in all devices with an operating system, for example, computers, laptops, smartphones, smartwatches, etc.

    -   When we use a program on a computer, such as Excel, we handle it on the so-called Graphical User Interface (GUI). The program converts every button click or other action into machine code and sends it to the operating system kernel. If we want to add a new column in an Excel table, this call goes to the system core. This in turn passes the call on to the computer processing unit (CPU), which executes the action.
