-   Using a development verison of Quarto

    -   First Usage
        -   Change directories to where you want to store the dev version

        -   Clone repo and change to the cloned directory

            ``` bash
            git clone https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli
            cd quarto-cli
            ```

        -   Disable Anti-Virus

        -   Run Configuration Script

            -   Windows Command Prompt

                ``` bash
                cmd /k configure.cmd
                ```

                -   `\k` keeps the window open in case it errors

            -   Powershell

                ``` powershell
                Invoke-Item configure.cmd
                ```

            -   Linux/MacOS

                ``` bash
                ./configure.sh
                ```

            -   This will take a minute or two as it checks versions, installs dependencies like pandoc, etc.

        -   Add path to quarto.cmd to PATH

            -   After the configuration file runs, it will output the path you need to put on PATH, e.g. `"C:\Users\erc\Documents\Quarto\quarto-cli\package\dist\bin"`

        -   Enable Anti-Virus

        -   Should be able to use in RStudio

            -   I was not able to use the RStudio terminal for quarto commands (e.g. `quarto check`) though.
            -   To find the version, I just opened powershell and ran `quarto –version` just to make sure it was running and on PATH.
                -   Not sure if they use this every time but it was 99.9.9 instead of the verion in the changelog.
            -   I also rendered a qmd file using `quarto-cmd` from the root directory of quarto-cli to see if it matched the output from RStudio. (`cd qmd` then `quarto preview forecasting-statistical.qmd --to html --no-watch-inputs --no-browse`)
    -   Subsequent Development Versions
        -   Change directory to quarto-cli and `git pull`

-   Shortcuts

    -   New R chunk: ctrl + alt + i
    -   Build whole book: ctrl+shift b
    -   Render page and preview book: ctrl+shift k

-   Using yaml style for chunk options\
    ![](./_resources/Quarto_RMarkdown.resources/FAiWv2DXMAEwZJH%20(2).jpg){.lightbox width="541"}

-   Convert Rmd chunk options to Quarto: `knitr::convert_chunk_header("doc.rmd", "doc.qmd")`

-   [**Anchor Link**]{style="color: #009499"} - A link, which allows the users to flow through a website page. It helps to scroll and skim-read easily. A named anchor can be used to link to a different part of the same page (like quickly navigating) or to a specific section of another page.

    -   This is the "#sec-moose" id that can be added to headers which it allows to be referenced within the document or in other documents.

## Syntax {#sec-quarto-quarto .unnumbered}

-   Align code chunk under bullet and add indented comment below chunk

    ```` markdown
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight} (using a SQL Query; method 1)

        ``` r
        # open dataset
        ds <- arrow::open_dataset(dir_out, partitioning = "species")
        # open connection to DuckDB
        con <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())
        # register the dataset as a DuckDB table, and give it a name
        duckdb::duckdb_register_arrow(con, "my_table", ds)
        # query
        dbGetQuery(con, "
          SELECT sepal_length, COUNT(*) AS n
          FROM my_table
          WHERE species = 'species=setosa'
          GROUP BY sepal_length
        ")

        # clean up
        duckdb_unregister(con, "my_table")
        dbDisconnect(con)
        ```

        -   filtering using a partition, the WHERE format is '\<partition_variable\>=\<partition_value\>'
    ````

    -   Space between bullet and top ticks
    -   Space between bottom ticks and bullet
    -   Note alignment of text

-   Add Code Annotations

    ```` markdown
    -   [Partition a large file and write to arrow format]{.underline}

        ``` r
        lrg_file <- open_dataset(<file_path>, format = "csv") # <1>
        lrg_file %>%
            group_by(var) %>% # <2>
            write_dataset(<output_dir>, format = "feather") # <3>
        ```

        1.  Pass the file path to `open_dataset()`

        2.  Use `group_by()` to partition the Dataset into manageable chunks

        3.  Use `write_dataset()` to write each chunk to a separate Parquet file---all without needing to read the full CSV file into R

        -   `open_dataset` is fast because it only reads the metadata of the file system to determine how it can construct queries
    ````

## Chunk Options and YAML

-   Set global chunk options in yaml\
    ![](./_resources/Quarto_RMarkdown.resources/image.png){.lightbox width="283"}

-   Enable Margin Notes

    ``` yaml
    ---
    # YAML front matter
    reference-location: margin
    ---
    ```

-   `!expr` to render code within chunk options

    -   e.g. figure caption: `#| fig-cap: !expr glue::glue("The mean temperature was {mean(airquality$Temp) |> round()}")`

-   Conditional Code Chunk Evaluation

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: document output type

        -   Set value in a code chunk

            ```` markdown
            ```{{r setup}}
            # Include in first chunk of .qmd
            # Get output file type
            out_type <- knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to")
            ```
            ````

        -   Use `!expr` sytax to determine evaluation status

            -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: eval chunk based on output type

                ```` markdown
                ```{{r}}
                #| eval: !expr out_type == "html"
                    
                # code to create interactive {plotly}
                ```

                ```{{r}}
                #| eval: !expr out_type == "docx"
                    
                # code to create static {ggplot2}
                ```
                ````

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Use parameterization to set value

        ``` yaml
        ---
        title: "test"
        format: html
        params:
          my_value: false
        ---
        ```

        -   [my_value]{.var-text} can then be used throughout the document to determine chunk evaluation status

-   `column: screen-inset` yaml markup is used to show a very wide table

-   CLI

    -   `quarto render` to compile a document
    -   `quarto preview` to render a live preview that automatically updates when the source files are saved

-   Graphics

    -   Code Chunk

        ``` markdown
        #| dpi: 300
        #| fig.height: 7.2
        #| fig.width: 3.6
        #| dev: "png"
        #| echo: false
        #| warning: false
        #| message: false
        ```

        -   Example shows settings for a graph for mobile
        -   `fig.height` and `fig.width` are always given in inches

-   If you haven't set your Quarto document to be `self-contained`, then the images have also already been saved for you - probably in a folder called `documentname_files/figure-html/`

    ``` yaml
    format: 
      html:
        embed-resources: true
    ```

-   Knitr Hooks

    -   Notes from [Writing knitr hooks](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-12-30_knitr-hooks/)
        -   Also has a knitr hook example that alters cell output (e.g. only prints 4 lines of a vector)
    -   Chunk Hooks
        -   Chunk hooks get called twice: once before knitr executes the code in the chunk, and once again afterwards

        -   The function can take up to four arguments, all of which are optional:

            -   [before]{.arg-text}: A logical value indicating whether the function is being called before or after the code chunk is executed
            -   [options]{.arg-text}: The list of chunk options
            -   [envir]{.arg-text}: The environment in which the code chunk is executed
            -   [name]{.arg-text}: The name of the code chunk option that triggered the hook function

        -   The chunk hook is called for its side effects not the return value. However, if it returns a character output, knitr will add that output to the document output as-is.

        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Chunk Timer

            -   Code

                ``` r
                create_timer_hook <- function() {
                  start_time <- NULL
                  function(before, options) {
                    if (before) {
                      start_time <<- Sys.time()
                    } else {
                      stop_time <- Sys.time()
                      elapsed <- difftime(stop_time, start_time, units = "secs")
                      paste(
                        "<div style='font-size: 70%; text-align: right'>",
                        "Elapsed time:", 
                        round(elapsed, 2), 
                        "secs",
                        "</div>"
                      )
                    }
                  }
                }
                knitr::knit_hooks$set(timer = create_timer_hook())
                ```

                -   The hook is triggered the first time (with `before = TRUE`) to record the system time somewhere (e.g., in a variable called start_time). Then, when the hook is triggered the second time (with `before = FALSE`), it records the system time again (e.g., as stop_time), and computes the difference in time.

            -   Use in a cell

                ```` markdown
                ```{{r}}
                #| timer: true
                runif(10000)
                ```
                ````

            -   Output\

## R and Python

-   If only R or R and Python, the notebook is rendered by [{knitr}]{style="color: #990000"}

-   If only Python, the notebook is rendered by jupyter

-   Set-up

    -   [{reticulate}]{style="color: #990000"} automatically comes loaded in Quarto and it knows to use it when it sees a python block, so you don't need to load the package
    -   Quarto will select a version of Python using the [Python Launcher](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows) on Windows or system `PATH` on MacOS and Linux. You can override the version of Python used by Quarto by setting the `QUARTO_PYTHON` environment variable.
        -   In CLI on Windows, type `py` is see which version the Python Launcher , and therefore Quarto, is using and `py –list` to see which versions are installed.

-   R

    ```` markdown
    ```{{r}}
    #| label: read-data
    #| echo: true
    #| message: false
    #| cache: true
    lemurs <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-08-24/lemur_data.csv')
    ```
    ````

-   Python

    ```` markdown
    ```{{python}}
    #| label: modelling 
    #| echo: true 
    #| message: false

    lemur_data_py = r.lemur_data 
    import statsmodels.api as sm 
    y = lemur_data_py[["Weight"]] 
    x = lemur_data_py[["Age"]] 
    x = sm.add_constant(x) 
    mod = sm.OLS(y, x).fit() 
    lemur_data_py["Predicted"] = mod.predict(x) 
    lemur_data_py["Residuals"] = mod.resid`
    ```
    ````

    -   Use `r.` to access the data in the R chunk
    -   The first execution of a python cell starts `reticulate::repl_python()` in the terminal

-   (back to) R

    ```` markdown
    ```{{r}}
    #| label: plotting 
    #| echo: true 
    #| output-location: slide 
    #| message: false 
    #| fig-align: center 
    #| fig-alt: "Scatter plot of predicted and residual values for the fitted linear model." 

    library(reticulate) 
    library(ggplot2) 
    lemur_residuals <- py$lemur_data_py 
    ggplot(data = lemur_residuals, aes(x = Predicted, y = Residuals)) +
      geom_point(colour = "#2F4F4F") +
      geom_hline(yintercept = 0,
                colour = "red") +
      theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#eaf2f2", colour = "#eaf2f2"),
            plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#eaf2f2", colour = "#eaf2f2"))
    ```
    ````

    -   Use `py$` to access the data in the Python chunk \*
    -   Must call `library(reticulate)` in order for Quarto to recognize `py$`

## Layouts

-   2 cols (1 col: text, 1 col: image)\
    ![](_resources/Quarto_RMarkdown.resources/quarto-2col-text-img.png){.lightbox width="554"}

    ``` markdown
    ::: {layout="[50,50]"}

    ::: column
    Every Quarto project starts with a Quarto file that has the extension `.qmd`.


    This particular one analyzes children's early words, but every `.qmd` includes the same three basic elements inside:


    - A block of metadata at the top, between two fences of `---`s. This is written in [YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/). 
    - Narrative text, written in [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/). 
    - Code chunks in gray between two fences of ```` ``` ````, written with R or another programming language.


    You can use all three elements to develop your code and ideas in one reproducible document.
    :::

    ![](img/01-source.png)
    :::
    ```

-   2 figures, 2 columns (i.e. side-by-side) with captions at the top

    ``` markdown
    ---
    fig-cap-location: top
    ---

    -   Words
        -   Predictions of Standard RF vs Oblique RF

            ::: {layout-ncol="2"}
            ![Standard Random Forest](_resources/Regression,_Survival.resources/ml-rf-obl-vs-axis-axpred-1.png){fig-align="left" width="432"}

            ![Oblique Random Forest](_resources/Regression,_Survival.resources/ml-rf-obl-vs-axis-oblpred-1.png){fig-align="left" width="432"}
            :::

            -   Words  
    ```

    -   [fig-cap-location: bottom]{.arg-text} is default;
    -   [fig-cap-location: margin]{.arg-text} is buggy, at least in for project type book. Captions are added to the margins but bullet points mysteriously disappear during rendering to html

-   2 charts side-by-side extending past body margins

    ```` markdown
    ```{{r}}
    #| label: my-figure
    #| layout-ncol: 2
    #| column: page
    ggplot() + ...
    ggplot() + ...
    ```
    ````

    -   "layout-ncol" says 2 side-by-side columns
    -   "column: page" says extend column width to the width of the page

## WebR

-   Set-Up

    -   Install the extension alongside your blog post by running `quarto add coatless/quarto-webr`
    -   Add the extension to your blog by adding `filters: ["webr"]` to your post’s frontmatter
    -   Instead of `{r}` code chunks, use `{webr-r}` ones

-   Install CRAN packages on page load

    ``` yaml
    filters:
      - "webr"
    webr:
      packages:
      - "dplyr"
      - "tidyr"
      - "purrr"
      - "tibble"
      - "crayon"
    ```

    -   Add to frontmatter

-   Install R-Universe Package

    ```` markdown
    ```{{webr-r}}
    #| context: setup
    webr::install("collateral", repos = c("https://jimjam-slam.r-universe.dev"))
    ```
    ````

    -   R-Universe packages must be installed in code cells
