-   A clearly defined **business problem** and targeted success metrics that's agreed upon by data scientists and stakeholders are essential before starting a project.

    -   It should be measurable, clear, and actionable.
    -   Use the "Challenge Framework" to solve difficult problems
        -   Every situation is a function of:
            -   Incentives
            -   Personalities
            -   Perspectives
            -   Constraints
            -   Resources
        -   In most "tough" situations, 2+ are misaligned. Figure out which and hone in on them.

-   Bum, Buy, then Build

    1.  Bum free solutions while also relaxing quality thresholds.
    2.  Look at buyable options, especially from large, mature organizations that offer low-cost, stable products (with potential discounts if the project is for a non-profit).
    3.  Resort to building only if:
        -   It is far too inefficient to adapt workflows to existing solutions and/or
        -   There is an opportunity for reuse by other nonprofits.

-   Add a buffer

    -   if the business goal is a precision of 95%, you can try tuning your model to an operating point of 96--97% on the offline evaluation set in order to account for the expected model degradation from data drift.

-   Contracts

    -   Only promise what is in your power to deliver
        -   Example: A contract with the business stakeholders was to guarantee X% recall on known (historic) data.
            -   It doesn't try to make guarantees about something that the ML team doesn't have complete control over: the actual recall in production depends on the amount of data drift, and is not predictable.

-   Deliver a **Minimally Viable Product (MVP)** first.

    -   Should be a product with only the primary features required to get the job done
    -   This process with help decide:
        -   how to implement a more fully fledged product
        -   which additional features might be infeasible or not worth the time and effort to get working

-   **Sources** of data

    -   Internal resources: Existing historical datasets could be repurposed for new insights.
        -   Considerations for collecting data
            -   Whether you want to collect qualitative or quantitative data
            -   The method for collecting (e.g., surveys, using other reports)
            -   The timeframe for the data
            -   Sample size
            -   Owners of the data
            -   Data sensitivity
            -   Data storage and reporting method (e.g., Salesforce)
            -   Potential pitfalls or biases in the data (e.g., sample bias, confirmation bias)
    -   External resources: Governmental organizations, nonprofits, and research institutions have free, accessible datasources that span all different sectors (e.g., agriculture, healthcare, education).

-   Outputs vs Outcomes

    -   Logic model
        -   It focuses on how inputs and activities translate to outputs and eventually

## General Steps for Starting a Project {#sec-proj-plan-gensteps}

1.  Framing a data question
    -   Guidelines
        -   Precision: Be as detailed as possible in how you frame your questions. Avoid generic words like 'improve' or 'success.' If you want to improve something, specify by how much. If you want to achieve something, specify by when.
            -   Decide before starting what the minimum project performance is to productionize (i.e. build a fully functional project) and launch (i.e. deliver to all your customers)
                -   Setting these thresholds at the beginning will help to prevent you from bargaining with yourself or stakeholders to deliver the project that might harm your business
                    -   After working hard on a project and pouring resources into it, it can be difficult to end it.
        -   Data-Centric: Consider the role of data in your organization. Can data help you answer this question? Is it clear what data you will need to collect to answer this question? Can progress on the task be codified into a metric that can be measured? If the answer to any of these questions is ambiguous or negative, investing in additional data resources may be an inefficient allocation of resources.
    -   Example![](./_resources/Project,_Planning.resources/1-kmtgdi2vsrlZFYriwwQZLQ.png)
2.  Figure Out What Data You Need
    -   Guidelines
        -   Necessity: Are the data you are collecting necessary? Avoid data bloat, which is over-collecting data points for a "just in case" scenario. This makes sustaining long-term data collection of those fields far more burdensome.
        -   Availability: Are there external, publicly available data sources like government data that you can leverage? If the data needs to be collected, how easy is it to collect? If it is hard to collect, do you have a plan and resources in place as to how you can ensure it is collected at regular intervals over time? One-off data collection is rarely helpful as there is no reference point to measure the impact of interventions over time.
        -   Maintainability: Can you maintain and easily update this data over time? Is the cost of doing so sustainable? This is critical because longitudinal data collection with standard fields is one of the most valuable resources for a nonprofit. Avoid constantly changing field names, a moving target of data collection objectives, and costly data collection procedures (like purchasing third-party data) that are not sustainable given your overall budget.
        -   Reliability: If you are using a third party data source, do you trust the quality of the data? What are the ways this data may be biased, incomplete, or inaccurate?
    -   Example
        -   A nonprofit with a mission to find long-term housing for the unhoused. This organization may want to answer the question: *'what percentage of the unhoused have we been able to successfully rehabilitate in the area we serve?*'![](./_resources/Project,_Planning.resources/1-u-gvwzJ_56rjqe4rQYAafA.png)
3.  Organizational Buy-in
    -   Project manager tries to examine whether the project can fundamentally be classified as feasible and whether the requirements can be carried out with the available resources.
        -   Expert Interviews: Is the problem in general is very well suited for the deployment of data science and are there corresponding projects that have already been undertaken externally and also published?
        -   Data science team: Are there a sufficient number of potentially suitable methods for this project and are the required data sources are available?
        -   IT department: check the available infrastructure and the expertise of the involved employees.
    -   Make sure everyone on the team agrees on what data that you want to collect and measure and who owns the data collection process.
    -   Having someone of authority or that's respected in each department involved in the development of the product will go a long way to building trust with users when it's fully deployed
        -   Example: Demand Forecasting Automation
            -   Team should consist of Supply Chain department and close collaboration with Sales and IT
    -   Example
        -   Suppose teachers at a school are interested in fielding quantitative surveys to track student outcomes, but there exists little incentive for teachers to collect this data on top of regular work. As a result, only one teacher in the school volunteers to design and administer the survey to their class. However, the survey results will now be limited to the students' experiences and outcomes for just the one class. The measured outcomes will be biased because they will not capture any variance across students from different classes in the school.
4.  Calculate How Much Data You Need to Collect
5.  Make sure you've answered these questions
    -   Is the problem definition clear and specific? Are there measurable criteria that define success or failure?
    -   Is it technically feasible to address the defined problem within the designated timeframe? Is the data required for the envisioned solution approach available?
    -   Do all relevant stakeholders agree with the problem definition, performance indicators, and selection criteria?
    -   Does the intended technical solution resolve the initial business problem?

## Workshopping  {#sec-proj-plan-wkshp}

-   Misc
    -   Notes from: [Successfully Combining Design Thinking and Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/successful-combining-design-thinking-and-data-science-8ec6b1b7cc8e)
    -   Usually last 1 hr
-   Supplies
    -   Different coloured sticky notes --- enough so that everyone has at least 15--20
    -   Whiteboard markers for the sticky notes. Permanent markers will likely cause some unintended permanent damage and thin, ballpoint pens are difficult to read unless you're right up close to them
    -   1 white board per group, or alternatively, 2 x large A2 pieces of paper
-   Participants
    -   Key business stakeholders involved in the area you're working on --- you need management buy-in if anything is going to happen
    -   Two or three people who will actually use the tools or insights you'll be delivering
    -   A facilitator (probably you) and a few members of your data science or analytics team
-   Challenge Identification Workshop
    -   Suited for a situation when the business stakeholders know what their challenges are, but don't know what you can do for them.
    -   Goals:
        -   DS: Try to understand the customer pain points as well as you can.
            -   Do not try to develop solutions in this workshop
        -   Stakeholders: get as many ideas out as possible in the time allotted.
    -   Additional Supplies
        -   Poster or slide with user journey, or something similar, depending on the business
            -   Helps to guide participants to home-in on customer pain points
            -   Needs to be done before the workshop
            -   Example![](./_resources/Project,_Planning.resources/image.png)
    -   Process
        -   Introduction
            -   Brief introduction of your team
            -   Brief 5-minute 'Best In Class' slide or two where I look at companies who are currently doing amazing things, preferably in the data science domain, in the area that our stakeholders work
            -   Address goal of the workshop (see above for stakeholders)
        -   Split into two or three groups
            -   Ideally between four to five people per group
            -   Put senior managers or executives in separate groups
            -   1 DS or analyst in each group
        -   Write as many customer pain points as possible (aka Ideation)
            -   Duration: 25--30 minutes
            -   Everybody writes ideas on sticky note and puts on their board
                -   No need for whole group to approve of the idea.
                    -   "Bad" ideas are weeded out later
            -   If you see themes popping up, go ahead and group similar sticky-notes together
            -   DS or analyst needs to pay attention to each proposed idea, so as to be able to write a fuller description of the idea later on
                -   If possible, note the author of each idea so as to be able to ask them questions later if needed.
            -   (You) Walk around to each group
                -   Remind them of the rules (get down as many ideas as possible)
                -   Prompt them with questions to get more ideation happening within the groups
        -   One member from each of the groups presents their group's key ideas back to the rest of the room
            -   Duration: 3-5 min per group
        -   Place similar stickies into groups or themes
        -   Vote on the best ideas
            -   Duration: 3 min
            -   Everyone gets three dot stickers and is allowed to vote for any ideas
            -   They can put all their stickies on one idea or divide them up however they like
            -   No discussions
            -   If it's the case that one sticky within a theme of stickies gets all the votes, or even if the votes are all shared equally, consider all of those as votes towards the theme.
-   Predefined Problem Sculpting Workshop
    -   The difference between this approach and the first one is that here the business stakeholders already have an idea about what they need.
        -   e.g a metric of some sort, some kind of customer segmentation or some kind of tool
    -   Example
        -   Develop 'affluency score' for each banking customer.
    -   Goal: Answer 2 questions
        -   What is it that we're trying to do?
            -   Defining *what* it is you're trying to do will help to define what is meant by the metric/segment/measure you're developing.
            -   From example (see Goal above), it's vital that everyone in the room understands *what* is meant by "affluence."
                -   Does it mean:
                    -   how much money someone currently has?
                    -   It is a measure of their potential spend?
                    -   Does it refer to their lifestyle and how much debt they may take on and can realistically pay?
        -   Why do we want to do this?
            -   The answer to *why* has design implications
            -   Examples
                -   Is it something we'll use to set strategic goals?
                -   Do we want to use it to identify cross or upsell opportunities?
    -   Additional Supplies:
        -   Poster or slide with these 2 questions
    -   Process
        -   Introduction
            -   Brief introduction of your team
            -   Address goals of the workshop
        -   Split into two or three groups
            -   Ideally between four to five people per group
            -   Put senior managers or executives in separate groups
            -   1 DS or analyst in each group
        -   Have groups answer the "What" question
            -   Duration: 15 min
        -   Feedback session with whole workshop
            -   Duration: 3 min
            -   Group answers are presented and discussed
        -   Have groups answer the "Why" question
            -   Duration: 15 min
        -   Feedback session with whole workshop
            -   Duration: 3 min
            -   Group answers are presented and discussed
    -   Compare and address gaps
        -   Duration: 4 min
        -   Compare all group answers against the current solution
            -   e.g. does the current metric represent these answers to "what" and "why"?
        -   If there are gaps between the group answers and the current solution, try to figure out how best the fill those gaps.
-   Post-Workshop Debrief
    -   Should occur the same day as the workshop
    -   Document sticky notes and key ideas![](./_resources/Project,_Planning.resources/image.1.png)
        -   The data scientists/analysts embedded in the groups should be able to expand on the ideas on the sticky notes
        -   If the author of the idea was recorded, that should be included as well
            -   As you're starting to think of solutions to the pain points you discussed, reach out to authors/stakeholders to get their opinions on your thoughts and to understand where you might be able to get the data from.
    -   Have data team ideate on solutions to these painpoints, etc.

## Things to consider when choosing a project  {#sec-proj-plan-thgscndr}

-   Misc
    -   Also see [Optimization, general](Optimization,%20general) \>\> Budget Allocation
-   Considerations
    -   Balancing the goals of your department with the desires of stakeholders
        -   Before handling projects that are possible with the available data, address projects of immediate need to the business according to stakeholders.
            -   Need to feel they're getting what they think is value from the data department.
        -   Also, have to ask, "how are we going to make money from this output?" and metrics "What organizational KPIs are tied to these metrics and how?".
            -   It is reasonable to (tactfully) say that the "wins" column of your self-evaluation needs some big victories this year, and the "top 10 products shipped this hour" dashboard isn't going to get us where we want to be as an organization. Some fluff is acceptable to keep the peace.
            -   No one will rush to the defense of the data team come budget season, regardless of how many low-value asks you successfully delivered, as requested, in the prior year (this is called executive amnesia).
    -   Being useful
        -   Situations
            -   Improving upon a metric score (business or model)
                -   "analyze actual failure cases and have a hard and honest think about what will fix the largest number of them. (My prediction: improving the data will by and large trump a more complex method.) The point is, you have to have a real think about what will actually improve the number, and that might involve work that's stupid and boring. Don't just reach for a smart new shiny thing and hope for the best."
            -   a lot of product people running around saying "we want to do this thing asap, but we don't know if it's possible
                -   Just find a product person who seems sane, buddy up with them, and work on what they want. They should be experts in their product, have an understanding of what the potential market for it is, and so really know what will be useful and what won't.
-   Process![](./_resources/Project,_Planning.resources/image.2.png)
    -   Score Potential Projects
        -   Create a score for "impact"
            -   Possible impact score features
                -   Back of the envelope monetary value
                -   Customer experience score / Net Promoter Score (NPS)
        -   Create a score for "difficulty"
            -   Possible difficulty score features
                -   how long you believe the project will take to build
                -   resource constraints into consideration
                -   how difficult the data may be to acquire and clean
        -   Categorize each project as Low Hanging Fruit, Quick Wins, Long Term Projects, and Distractions based the Impact and Difficulty Scores
            -   See chart above
        -   Prioritize Low Hanging Fruit
        -   Consult with stakeholders and decide which Quick Wins and Long Term Projects to pursue

## Elevator Pitch  {#sec-proj-plan-elevptch}

-   Components

    -   Value Proposition:
        -   Describe the problem
            -   Who is dissatisfied with the current environment
            -   The targeted segment that your project is addressing
        -   Describe the product/service that you are developing and what specific problem that it is solving
    -   Your Differentiation:
        -   Describe the alternative (perhaps your competition or currently available product/service)
        -   Describe a specific (not all) functionality or feature that is different from the currently available product/service.

-   Delivery Formula

    -   For \[targeted segment of customers/users\],
    -   Who are dissatisfied with \[currently available product/service\]
    -   Our product/service is a \[new product category\]
    -   That provides a \[key problem-solving capability\]
    -   Unlike \[product/service alternative\],
    -   We have assembled \[Key product/service features for your specific application\]

-   Example **For** political election campaign managers,

    ```         
      **Who are dissatisfied with** the traditional polling products,

      **Our application is a** new type of polling product

      **That provides** the ability to design, implement, and get results within 24 hours.

      **Unlike** the other traditional polling products that take over 5 days to complete,

      **We have assembled** a quick and more economic yet comparably accurate polling product.
    ```

-   Example **For** front line criminal investigators,

    ```         
      **Who are dissatisfied with** generic dashboards that display too much unnecessary information,

      **Our application is a** new type of Intelligence product

      **That provides** a highly customized and machine learning-enabled risk assessment tool that allows the investigator to uncover a hidden network of potentially criminals.

      **Unlike** the current dashboard that provides information that is often not very useful,

      **We have assembled** an intelligence product that allows them to make associations between known and unknown actors of interest.
    ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis Research Plan (EDARP)  {#sec-proj-plan-edarp}

-   Imperative that this plan be formulated before work on the project begins

1.  Develop a research question and objectives to be met
    -   A concise research question and objective allows the stakeholders to be informed on how their departments will be affected.
    -   Soft skills are important in being able to make a stakeholder comfortable with answering questions.
    -   It helps if each stakeholder feels like their input is necessary to the project. More likely to get invested in its success. May require salesmanship to convince them that the knowledge of self has future benefits
    -   Coming up with a concise question often involves drilling down into the mechanics of an organization.
        -   This process can lead to discovering the importance of the research. Also, can lead to other research questions.
    -   If stakeholder is ambiguous about what they want. Useful to use a backwards path by starting with what the stakeholder envisions as the final output
        -   "Can you tell me about the decisions you are going to make based on the output of this request? Understanding those decisions will help us ensure that the (report/data/model) we build for you will fulfill your needs."
    -   If a concise question cannot be obtained or the objective is open-ended, you should gather all the information obtained and use it determine what you think the objective of the project should be. Then, develop a prototype
        -   After a portion of the project is completed, it will be necessary to share the progress with the stakeholders and revise aspects of the project as needed. More of an iterative process.
        -   The iteration can increase buy-in from stakeholders and develop a more concise question
    -   After the question is decided upon, what does success look like? What are the metrics of evaluation?  
2.  Define methods to address the question
    -   type of method depends on the type of question
        -   descriptive
            -   Usually answered with historical data, e.g historical trends. Often presented in dashboards
            -   mean, min, max, etc.
            -   plots for understanding relationships
            -   outlier detection
        -   predictive
            -   predictive models and forecasting
            -   regression, classification, clustering
        -   prescriptive
            -   predictive models + proposing actions
3.  Determine which data is on-hand and which need to be acquired
    -   Also see pipeline section below
    -   Note data sources
        -   Structured
        -   Unstructured
        -   Internal
        -   External
    -   Wrangle data
4.  Determine the budget and adjust prior steps to conform within this budget
    -   Determined required tools
        -   compute capacity
        -   end user requirements
        -   business interests
    -   Make effort to minimize cost as much as possible. Makes dialogue with stakeholders easier
5.  Stakeholders
    -   A departments that will make use of the output or be effected by should be involved
        -   Convincing them to be involved is important if any issues with budgets, etc. pop-up. Having more people on your side will help.
            -   Using a proof-of-concept or information of past successes of such projects within or outside the organization can help.
            -   Need to proof on how this research will increase their ROI. Prototypes with datascience outputs can go a long way convincing or increasing buy-in from skeptical stakeholders.
    -   Their concerns should be noted and addressed.
    -   Often times they are the end-user, so having them involved can lead to a better output. A greater probability of the project being involved in decision making.
6.  How will the end-users make use of the output?
    -   Should the output be a report or app?
7.  Develop a plan of action for upkeep or maintenance of the project
    -   Monitoring model drift
    -   Changes in the business
    -   Resolve any lingering user concerns
    -   Determine schedule for updating project 
    -   Schedule stakeholder meeting to discuss the project and determine if further steps needed

-   [{tidyquant}]{style="color: #990000"} has excel functions for Net Present Value (NPV), Future Value of Cashflow (FV), and Present Value of Future Cashflow (PV)
-   \*\* A lot of this stuff wasn't used in the examples\*\*
    -   Focus on fixed and variable costs, investment, depreciation, cost of capital, tax rate, revenue, qualitative factors
-   Net Present Value (NPV) is used as the final quantitative metric (Value in flow chart)
    -   Short running projects can just use the orange boxes to calculate value
    -   Long running projects would use orange, blue, and gray boxes to calculate value
-   The values for each variable need to calculated for each year (or whatever time unit) of the project.
-   Different scenarios (pessimistic, optimistic) can be created by modifying the parameters of the model like the life span, the initial investment, or the costs, to see the potential financial impact on Value.
-   **Making a decision**
    -   Compare your NPV and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) with alternative analytics projects that the organization is considering to see which one is more attractive.
    -   Balance the quantitative and qualitative factors while considering the potential risks of the project.
        -   Example
            -   "In *quantitative factors,* we used the cash flow model where we calculated a net present value of USD \$7,187,955. Related to *qualitative factors* and *potential risks*, we can conclude that if the project is back up by an influential group of leaders, then the positive aspects exceed the negative ones. On the balance, we would advise a **GO decision** for this project."
-   **Executive Presentation**
    -   The conclusion should be short, precise, and convincing format
    -   Crucial to persuade key stakeholders to invest in your project
    -   Use a good action title, writing down the most relevant requirements of your project, use a chart to visualize your results, and have some key takeaways on the bottom with a recommendation.![](./_resources/Project,_Planning.resources/1-DX0AtbCEGuF6fkJwOAM2nw.png)
-   **Proposal**
    -   Sections 1-3 should be put into a concise executive summary
    -   Tell a story
        -   Every item should be consistent with every other part
            -   e.g. a deliverable shouldn't be mentioned if it's not part of solving the issue in the problem statement
        -   Should flow from more abstract ideas to more and more detail
    -   Format
        1.  Problem Statement
            -   Paint a bleak picture and explain how the problem could've been overcome if your project were in production when the problem occurred
            -   List examples where risk and costs occurred, opportunities were missed, etc. and how your project would've prevented or taken advantage of these things if it had been in production
                -   skill upgrades or efficiency gains are NOT good answers
        2.  Vision
            -   Ties your project to the companies long range strategy
        3.  Benefits
            -   details  about the specific new capabilities provided or costs avoided
            -   need to be quantifiable
        4.  Deliverables
            -   details about other non-primary benefits
        5.  Success Criteria
            -   Characteristics
                -   specific, measurable, bounded by a time period, realistic
        6.  The plan
            -   overview of the steps the project will take
                -   includes deadlines, waterfall or agile approach, etc.
        7.  Cost/Budget
-   **Terms**
    -   Cost/Investment
        -   Fixed
            -   Personnel salaries
                -   If you're using outside data consultants, Glassdoor has average salaries, https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,13.htm
                    -   example: \~\$100K each
            -   Additional investments could be access to external data sources, research, and software licenses
                -   Tableau can cost around \$48K per year
            -   Training for any additional or current personnel on tools or subject matter
                -   workshops, online learning
                -   tax-reclamation example: \~\$12K total
        -   Variable
            -   Cloud storage
                -   tax-reclamation example: AWS (pay-as-you-go) \$75K-\$95K per year
    -   Tax rate
        -   tax-reclamation example: 28%
    -   Revenue
        -   Forecasts of revenue
    -   Correction Factors
        -   Explains the difference between profit after tax and cashflow
        -   e.g. depreciation of investment, changing working capital, investment, change in financing or borrowing
            -   cost of sales = (revenue\*some%) - 1
                -   refers to what the seller has to pay in order to create the product and get it into the hands of a paying customer.
                    -   Maybe this is a catch-all for anything else not covered in the Cost/Investment section
                -   aka cost of revenue (sales/service) or cost of goods (manufacturing)
                -   30% used in example
                -   Begins after year 1
            -   depreciation per year = (investment - salvage_value)/(num_years - 1)
                -   For an datascience project, the salvage_value is 0 most of the time.
                -   depreciation value is listed for each year after the first year of the project
                -   gets subtracted from revenue in calculation of profit_before_tax calculation
                -   gets added to profit_after_tax in cashflow equation
            -   Change in working capital = (expected_yearly_revenue/365) \* customer_credit_period
                -   customer_credit_period (days): number of days that a customer is allowed to wait before paying an invoice. The concept is important because it indicates the amount of working capital that a business is willing to invest in its accounts receivable in order to generate sales.
                    -   60 days used in example
                -   Only a cost in the 1st yr and then it is recouped in the last year (somehow)
                    -   sounds like this whole thing is just an accounting procedure
                -   Dunno how this relates to a datascience project
    -   Cost of Capital (also see discount rate/hurdle rate, cost of capital in Business Algorithms note)
        -   Used to characterize risk here. Think 5-10% is used for back-of-the-envelope calculations.
            -   tax-reclamation example: 8.3%
        -   Also see
            -   [Algorithms, Product](Algorithms,%20Product) \>\> Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) \>\> Internal Rate of Return
            -   [Morgan Stanley's Guide to Cost of Capital](https://t.co/1cKEh7cNRx) (Also in R \>\> Documents \>\> Business)
                -   [Thread](https://twitter.com/mjmauboussin/status/1625886391551815681) about the guide
        -   cost of capital typically calculated as Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
            -   WACC = w1\*cost_of_equity + w2\*cost_of_debt
                -   w1, w2 depend on the company's capital structure (e.g. 70% equity, 30% debt)
                -   CAPM = Rf + β (Rm - Rf)
                    -   cost_of_equity approximated using capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
                    -   Rf = risk-free rate of return
                    -   Rm = market rate of return
                    -   β = risk estimate or a company's stock beta or a similar public company's stock beta
                -   cost_of_debt = (interest_expense / total_debt) \* (1 - T)
                    -   interest_expense = interest paid on company's current debt
                        -   Since interest expense is tax-deductible, the debt is calculated on an after-tax basis
                    -   T = company's marginal tax rate
        -   As of January 2019, transportation in railroads has the highest cost of capital at 11.17%. The lowest cost of capital can be claimed by non-bank and insurance financial services companies at 2.79%.
        -   High CoCs - Biotech and pharmaceutical drug companies, steel manufacturers, Internet (software) companies, and integrated oil and gas companies. Those industries tend to require significant capital investment in research, development, equipment, and factories.
        -   Low CoCs - Money center banks, power companies, real estate investment trusts (REITs), retail grocery and food companies, and utilities (both general and water). Such companies may require less equipment or benefit from very steady cash flows.
    -   Net Present Value (NPV)
        -   Uses cashflow (excludes year 1) and cost of capital as inputs
            -   Excel has some sort of NPV wizard that does the calculation (see tidyquant for npv function)
            -   Example in article provided link to his googlesheet so the formula is there or maybe googlesheets has a wizard too.
    -   Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
        -   It's the value that the cost of capital (aka discount rate) would have to be for NPV and cost to zero out each other.
        -   The interest rate at which a company borrows against itself as a proxy for opportunity cost. Typically, large and/or public organizations have a budgetary IRR of 10% to 15% depending on the industry and financial situation.
        -   Higher is better
        -   Investopedia has an easy formula
            -   https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irr.asp
    -   Qualitative Factors
        -   Other things that have value but are difficult to quantify. Might change a quantitatively negative value project into a positive value project
            -   Uses columns negative, positive, impact
                -   negative and positive are indicators
                -   impact has values low, medium, and high
        -   Examples
            -   Project has flexibility (+) (calculated using real options analysis(?))
            -   Strategic Fit (+) - supports strategy of the company (?)
                -   increases trust with public
                -   marketing boosted because they can use buzzwords like "AI" or "data-driven" in ads
            -   Increases competency (+) - may help the company down the road
                -   more agile, data-driven, familiarity with newer technologies
            -   red tape or bureaucracy or politics causing delays (-)
            -   Implementation (-)
                -   can be a negative, if the leadership that's needed is tied up with other projects
                -   Challenges

## Choosing a Pipeline Framework  {#sec-proj-plan-capf}
   ![](./_resources/Project,_Planning.resources/undefined.png)
-   Kind of like working backwards in the data analysis workflow (*design driven development*)
-   Quantify the problems and develop KPIs that can inform the direction of the business
    -   10-15 organizational KPIs is common
    -   Examples: Number of daily sales, the number of new customers, decreasing cost of operations/logistics
-   Build data pipelines around these critical KPIs
    -   What data can we use that we already have access to?
    -   What kind of internal data do we need to capture?
    -   What kind of third party/external data could be useful?
    -   What is the least amount of data available that can be used to approximate each KPI metric?
        -   After the simplest version of the metric is built, you can brainstorm on how it can be improved.
            -   Personalize a general metric to your specific business.
            -   Split a general metric into smaller metrics can increase accuracy (e.g. product line, geography, etc.)
    -   What kind of storage will we need?
-   Adding a pipeline for a new data source
    -   Capture a sample of the data to examine its potential. (e.g. cookies on your website)
    -   If metric measured from new data is potentially valuable, build a simple, less robust (without sacrificing too much data integrity) pipeline to your lake.
        -   Meaning fewer built-in quality checks
        -   Doing it this way does add technical debt
        -   If metric feeds into a company-wide metric, then additional checks will need to be added
            -   E.g. no duplicate datasets, data corruption, or data losses.
    -   After 6 months or so, if metric remains useful, make pipeline more robust.
-   Adding third party data pipeline (e.g. Equifax)
    -   E.g. demographic, income data
    -   If a product has a certain demographics associated with it, this data can be used to weight customers relative to the demographic specifics of that product.
    -   Get a sample first to determine if it's worth it
        -   3rd party data is expensive to buy and usually a reoccurring cost.
        -   Can be time-consuming and resource intensive to add the pipeline
    -   Get transparency on how the data was collected and validity checks used
-   Periodically reevaluate whether the metrics fundamentally still make sense from a business perspective and how they can be improved.
    -   Expand pipelines to capture additional data in order to continue to refine metrics
    -   Drop and add metrics as business and trends change.
    -   Redefine metrics as needed
