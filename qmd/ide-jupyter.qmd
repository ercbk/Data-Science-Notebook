-   Kernel Menu Commands (navbar)

    -   Interrupt: This command stops the processes that are currently running in a cell. This can be used, for example, to stop the training of a model, even if not all training epochs have been reached yet.
    -   Restart & Run All: With this command, all cells can be executed again and the previous variables were deleted. This can be useful if you want to read a newer data set into the existing program.
    -   Restart: The sole command "Restart" leads to the same result, but not all cells are executed again.
    -   Reconnect: When training large models, the kernel can "die" because the memory is full. Then a reconnect makes sense.
    -   Shutdown: As long as a kernel is still running, it also ties up memory. If you run other programs in parallel for which you want to free memory, the "Shutdown" command can make sense.
