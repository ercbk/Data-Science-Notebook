    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[goodpractices](https://mangothecat.github.io/goodpractice/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} - Give advice about good practices when building R packages. Advice includes functions and syntax to avoid, package structure, code complexity, code formatting, etc
-   Version Number Syntax
    -   0.0.0.9000 = the ".9000" means intital experimental or in development version (.9001 would be the second experimental version)
    -   0.1.0 = the "1" means this is your first "minor" version
    -   1.0.0 = the "1" means this is your first "major" version
-   In function docs, always use \@examples and NOT \@example
-   If you have internal functions (e.g. little helper functions) that you don't want your users to have the regular access to then:
    -   Don't include \@export for that function's script
    -   Documentation of the function isn't required
-   Add a file from another repo using [`usethis::use_standalone`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_standalone.html)
    -   If another package has a set of functions that you'd like to include in your package but don't want to import their entire package, this can be used.
    -   It always overwrites an existing standalone file of the same name, making it easy to update previously imported code.
-   Using "Starting a Package" (below) takes some time when you want to test newly written functions.
    -   Alternative: `load_all()` - Quickly makes function available for interactive testing, (ctrl + shift + L)
-   Change package name (if not on CRAN): `changer::changer("current_pkg_name", "new_pkg_name")`
    -   Shouldn't have the package project open when running this. I set the working dir to the root of my "Projects" directory locally (e.g Projects \>\> current_proj_directory, then set working directory to Projects)
    -   This changes EVERYTHING automagically, but be sure and make a copy of the directory before running just in case.
    -   [Need to change repo name in the github repo's settings before pushing changes]{.underline}
-   Create Citation file for package: `usethis::use_citation()`
    -   Only execute after you've gone through putting your package on zenodo and have a generated citation to populate the fields of the CITATION file.
    -   See [indianacovid19data](https://github.com/ercbk/indianacovid19data/tree/master) project for example
-   If planning to release on CRAN, use `usethis::use_release_issue`, which creates a checklist of things to fix/do before submitting to CRAN
    -   CRAN requires your pkg run without issues on all platforms.

## Starting a Package

### Check package name, Create pkg, DESCRIPTION, Set-Up Git

1.  Check if package name already taken on CRAN: `available::available("package_name", browse = FALSE)`

    -   Asks you stuff about using "urban dictionary" to see if your package name might be offensive. Just say yes. (or it keeps asking)
    -   You want it to say that your package name is available on CRAN
    -   Shows sentiment analysis of your package name according to different dictionaries

2.  Create directory, a project, a basic package skeleton in that directory

    ``` r
    setwd("~/R/Projects")
    usethis::create_package("package_name")
    ```

3.  Open project and fill out some of DESCRIPTION

    -   Title, Authors, Description

4.  Go to Build pane in RStudio $\rightarrow$ more $\rightarrow$ Configure Build Tools $\rightarrow$ Make sure the "Generate documentation with Roxygen" box is ticked (tick it and click ok)

5.  Set-Up Git: `usethis::use_git()`

    -   It will ask to commit the package skeleton to github $\rightarrow$ Choose yes to commit locally
    -   It'll ask you to restart RStudio to activate the git pane $\rightarrow$ Choose yes
    -   Set-up of GH Auth token, if you don't have one
        -   Then use `usethis::create_github_token()` and follow steps
        -   Refresh session once you've updated .Renviron
    -   For private repo: `usethis::use_github(private = TRUE)`
    -   For public repo: `usethis::use_github(private = FALSE, protocol = "ssh")`
        -   Choose 1 to use ssh key
        -   "Are title and description okay?" $\rightarrow$ choose 3. Yes

### Basic Set-up

1.  Use Markdown for documentation: `usethis::use_roxygen_md()`
2.  Add license: `usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "Eric Book")`
3.  Add Readme.Rmd: `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`
    -   You'll still need to render/knit README.Rmd regularly.
    -   To keep README.md up-to-date, `devtools::build_readme()` is handy.
    -   You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render README.Rmd every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
4.  Add News/Changlog file: `usethis::use_news_md()`
5.  Add Article/Vignette: `usethis::use_vignette`
6.  Document, Install, and Check package
    -   Build pane $\rightarrow$
        -   more $\rightarrow$ Run Document
        -   Run Install and Restart
        -   Run Check
7.  Commit files and Push

### Development

-   Add common imported functions to DESCRIPTION

    ``` r
    usethis::use_tidy_eval()
    usethis::use_tibble()
    ```

-   Add data

    ``` r
    # read data into environment
    pkg_dat <- readr::read_rds("../path/to/data.rds")
    usethis::use_data(pkg_dat, overwrite = TRUE)
    ```

    -   Creates data directory and adds data as an .rda file
    -   Document the data: `usethis::use_r("data")`
        -   See [indianacovid19data](https://ercbk.github.io/indianacovid19data/reference/index.html) for examples
    -   If you want to store binary data and make it available to the user, put it in **data/**. This is the best place to put example datasets. If you want to store parsed data, but NOT make it available to the user, put it in **R/sysdata.rda**. This is the best place to put data that your functions need.
    -   If you want to store raw data, put it in **inst/extdata**.

-   Add Functions

    -   Create R file: `usethis::use_r("name-function-file")`
    -   Write function
        -   Use `pkg::function` format for every external package function
    -   Add documentation (e.g. `@description`, `@params`, `@returns`, `@details`, `@references`, `@export`, and `@examples`
        -   When pasting code into examples, use the RStudio multiple cursors feature (ctrl + alt + up/down) to add "#\>" to all the lines of code at once
    -   Add packages used in function to DESCRIPTION: `usethis::use_package("package_name")`
    -   Make sure hardcoded variable names are in global variables file
    -   Make sure any data used in `@examples` is added and documentedf
    -   If submitting to CRAN: need examples and they should be wrapped in `\dontrun{}` and `\donttest{}`.
    -   Test
        -   Build pane $\rightarrow$ more $\rightarrow$ Run Document (Ctrl+Shift+D) $\rightarrow$ Run Install and Restart (ctrl+shift+B) $\rightarrow$ Run Check (ctrl+shift+E)
    -   After writing a function or two, set-up {pkgdown}, and return here.
    -   Add new function to \_pkgdown.yml
    -   Add new function to any additional pages of the site (e.g. vignettes, Readme.Rmd)
        -   Remember to knit
    -   Run `pkgdown::build_site()`
        -   Knits html pages for reference function pages
    -   Commit and Push
    -   Rinse and Repeat for each function

### pkgdown

-   [Docs](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/)
-   Set-Up: `usethis::use_pkgdown()`
    -   Creates yaml file: \_pkgdown.yml
    -   Fill out yaml
-   Publish website and set-up Github Actions: `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`
-   Customize site
    -   Name css file, "extra.css", and place in folder called, "pkgdown" (also extra.js, extra.scss)
    -   When testing out themes, css features, etc., iterating is much faster when using `build_home_index(); init_site()` instead of `build_site()`. Then, refresh html page in browser.
    -   See docs for bslib variables that can be used in \_pkgdown.yml (requires using bootsrap 5).

## Dependencies {#sec-pkgdev-depend .unnumbered}

-   Imports and Depends

    -   Imports just *loads* the package
        -   Unless there is a good reason otherwise, you should always list packages in Imports not Depends. That's because a good package is self-contained, and minimises changes to the global environment (including the search path)
    -   Depends *attaches* it.

-   Loading and Attaching

    -   Loading
        -   The package is available in memory, but because it's not in the search path (path that R searches for functions), you won't be able to access its components without using ::.
    -   Attaching
        -   Puts the package in the search path. You can't attach a package without first loading it
        -   Both `library()` (throws error when pkg not installed )or `require()` (just returns false when pkg not installed) load then attach the package

## Testing {#sec-pkgdev-test .unnumbered}

-   Packages
    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} explicitly evaluates the outputs of your function but you can add a test that makes sure the checks on inputs within the function are working
    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[doctext](https://github.com/hughjonesd/doctest){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} - Generate tests from examples using {roxygen} and {testthat}
-   Run tests (Ctrl+Shift+T): `test()`
    -   Also ran when using, `check()`
-   Set-up - Run `usethis::use_testthat` within the project directory
    -   Creates:
        -   A tests folder in your working directory
        -   A testthat folder in the tests folder where your tests will live
        -   A testthat.R file in the tests folder which organizes things for running. Don't modify this manually.
-   Names of your testing files must begin with 'test'
    -   e.g. testing file, 'test-my-function.R', which lives in testthat folder
-   Writing Tests
    -   Write tests using the `test_that` function, and with each test, there's an "expectation."

    -   You can have one or more tests in each file and one or more expectations within each test.

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}

        ``` r
        test_that("description of the test", {
                test_output1 <- dat %>%
                    your_package_function()

                expect_equal(nrow(test_output1), 6)
                # etc...
        })
        ```

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}\
        ![](./_resources/Package_Development.resources/image.png){.lightbox width="432"}

        -   Where [sse]{.arg-text} is the function you're testing

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight} `expect_error(compute_corr(data = faithful, var1 = erruptions, var2 = waiting)`

        -   [erruptions]{.var-text} isn't a column in the dataset and should throw an error because of a check inside the function
        -   Also `expect_warning()` available

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Compare optional outputs of a nested function to the individual functions within that nested function\
        ![](./_resources/Package_Development.resources/image.2.png){.lightbox width="532"}

        -   [error]{.arg-text} is the nested function with optional outputs of sse error or mape error
        -   Second chunk should say "mape calculations work"
        -   1st chunk checks if error with sse option output is the same as sse output
        -   2nd chunk checks if error with mape option output is the same as mape output
-   Run Tests
    -   Use the [test_file]{.arg-text} function\
        ![](./_resources/Package_Development.resources/image.1.png){.lightbox width="432"}
    -   Use the [test_dir]{.arg-text} function: e.g. `test_dir(wd$test_that)` for running all tests.
    -   Press the Run Tests button in R Studio if you open the test file.
    -   Highlight and run the code.
