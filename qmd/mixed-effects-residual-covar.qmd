# Residual Covariance Structures {#sec-me-rcs .unnumbered}

## Misc {#sec-me-rcs-misc .unnumbered}

-   Notes from
    -   [Mixed Models with R \>\> Common Extensions \>\> Residual Structures](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/extensions.html#residual-structure)
-   The issue is that the way lmer works by default employs a method that won’t allow it incorporate other covariance structures(this is why it is faster and better performing than other packages).
    -   However many other packages work with lme4 model results, but not nlme, and if you aren’t going to use lme4 for mixed models you might as well go Bayesian with rstanarm or brms instead of nlme.
    -   Even prefers mgcv to nlme because of the other capabilities it provides, and the model objects created are easier to work
-   observations closer in time would be more strongly correlated than those further apart, or that the variance changes over time
-   mixed anova assumption is sphericity.

## Matrix Structures

-   The overall variance-covariance matrix is made up of submatrices for each subject

        -   Shows 5 subjects — each with 6 observations.
        -   Within the person, there are variances on the diagonal and covariances of observations on the off-diagonal
        -   Observations from one person have no covariance with another person (light gray area)
        -   This is supposed to be from the GPA data model ([link](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/random_intercepts.html#application)).
            -   Going by the numbers from the results of that model, the diagonal (orange) is the total variance (Between + Within-Subject).
            -   The off-diagonal values is the Between-Subject intercept variance
-   Compound Symmetry\
    $$
    \Sigma = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma^2 & \rho  & \rho \\
    \rho & \sigma^2 & \rho \\
    \rho & \rho & \sigma^2
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    -   Sphericity is a relaxed form of compound symmetry, where all (subjects?) the correlations have the same value, i.e. $\rho_1 = \rho_2 = \rho_3$, and all variances are equal.
-   Heterogeneous Variance\
    $$
    \Sigma = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_1^2 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \sigma_2^2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \sigma_3^2
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
-   Unstructured (or Symmetric) Correlation\
    $$
    \Sigma = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma^2 & \rho_1 & \rho_2 \\
    \rho_1 & \sigma^2 & \rho_3 \\
    \rho_2 & \rho_3 & \sigma^2
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
-   Autocorrelation\
    $$
    \Sigma = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma^2 & \rho & \rho^2 & \rho^3 \\
    \rho & \sigma^2 & \rho & \rho^2 \\
    \rho^2 & \rho & \sigma^2 & \rho \\
    \rho^3 & \rho^2 & \rho & \sigma^2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
