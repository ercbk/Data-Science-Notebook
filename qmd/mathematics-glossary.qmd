-   ***A priori*** - a type of knowledge that can be derived by reason alone
    -   Example: "If George V reigned at least four days, then he reigned more than three days."
-   ***A posteriori*** - a type of knowledge that expresses an empirical fact unknowable by reason alone.
    -   Example: "George V reigned from 1910 to 1936."
-   ***bias*** - see unbiased estimator
-   ***ceteris paribus*** - latin for "all things being equal" or "other things held constant."
-   ***closed form*** - a mathematical expression that uses a finite number of standard operations. It may contain constants, variables, certain well-known operations, and functions, but usually no limit, differentiation, or integration.
-   ***consistency*** - Requires that the outcome of the procedure with unlimited data should identify the underlying truth. Usage is restricted to cases where essentially the same procedure can be applied to any number of data items. In complicated applications of statistics, there may be several ways in which the number of data items may grow. For example, records for rainfall within an area might increase in three ways: records for additional time periods; records for additional sites with a fixed area; records for extra sites obtained by extending the size of the area. In such cases, the property of consistency may be limited to one or more of the possible ways a sample size can grow
-   ***degrees of freedom*** - When discussed about variable-sample size tradeoff, usually means n-p, where is the number of rows and p is the number of variables. The more variables used in the model the fewer degrees of freedom and therefore less power and precision.
-   ***exchangeability*** - means we can swap around, or reorder, variables in the sequence without changing their joint distribution.
    -   Every IID (independent, identically distributed) sequence is exchangeable - but not the other way around. Every exchangeable sequence is identically distributed, though
        -   Example: If you draw a sequence of red and blue marbles from a bag without replacement, the sample is exchangeable but not independent. e.g. drawing a red marble affects the probability of drawing a red or blue marble next.
-   ***efficiency*** - A test, estimator, etc. is more efficient than another test, estimator, etc. if it requires fewer observation to obtain the same level of performance.
-   ***ergodicity*** - the idea that a point of a moving system, either a dynamical system or a stochastic process, will eventually visit all parts of the space that the system moves in, in a uniform and random sense
-   ***external validity*** - Our estimates are externally valid if inferences and conclusions can be generalized from the population and setting studied to other populations and settings. (also see internal validity)
-   ***identifiable*** (aka point-indentifiable) - theoretically possible to learn the true values of this model's underlying parameters after obtaining an infinite number of observations from it (see non-identifiability, partially-indentifiable)
-   ***ill-conditioned*** - In SVD decomposition, when there's a huge difference between largest and smallest eigenvalue ofÂ the original matrix, *A*, the ratio of which is called condition number.
-   ***internal validity*** - our estimates are internally valid if statistical inferences about causal effects are valid for the population being studied. (also see external validity)
-   ***intractable*** - problems for which there exist no efficient algorithms to solve them. Most intractable problems have an algorithm -- the same algorithm -- that provides a solution, and that algorithm is the brute-force search
-   ***locality*** - effects have causes and chains of cause and effect must be unbroken in space and time (not the case in 'entanglement')
-   ***non-identifiability*** - the structure of the data and model do not make it possible to estimate the parameter's value. Multicollinearity is a type of non-identifiability problem. (i.e. two or more parametrizations of the model are observationally equivalent) (see identifiable, partially-indentifiable)
-   ***overdetermined system*** - In linear regression, when there are more observations than features, *n \> p*
-   ***partial coefficient*** - The coefficient of a variable in a multivariable regression. In a simple regression, the coefficient of the variable is just called the "regression coefficient."
-   ***partially-indentifiable*** (aka set identifiable) - non-identifiable but possible to learn the true values of a certain subset of the model parameters
-   ***robust*** - a "robust" estimator in statistics is one that is insensitive to outliers, whereas a "robust" estimator in econometrics is insensitive to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation ([hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/statistics-vs-econometrics/))
-   ***support*** (aka ***range***) - the set of values that the random variable can take.
    -   For discrete random variables, it is the set of all the realizations that have a strictly positive probability of being observed.
    -   For continuous random variables, it is the set of all numbers whose probability density is strictly positive.
    -   See [link](https://www.statlect.com/glossary/support-of-a-random-variable) for examples
-   ***underspecification*** - In general, the solution to a problem is underspecified if there are many distinct solutions that solve the problem equivalently.
-   An ***unbiased estimator*** is an accurate statistic that's used to approximate a population parameter.
    -   "Accurate" in this sense means that it's neither an overestimate nor an underestimate. If an overestimate or underestimate does happen, the mean of the difference is called a "**bias**."
-   ***Weak Law of Large Numbers*** (**Bernoulli's theorem**) - states that if you have a sample of independent and identically distributed random variables, as the sample size grows larger, the sample mean will tend toward the population mean
