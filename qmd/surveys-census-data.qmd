Misc

* FIPS GEOID![](./_resources/Surveys,_Census_Data.resources/image.png)
* [popular variable calculations from variables in ACS](https://stats.andrewheiss.com/zany-zebra/notebook/acs-data.html)
* Census Geocoder ([link](http://geocoding.geo.census.gov))
	* Enter an address and codes for various geographies are returned
	* Batch geocoding available for up to 10K records
		* Codes for geographies returned in a .csv file
* TIGERweb ([link](http://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerweb))
	* Allows you to get geography codes by searching for an area on a map
	* Once zoomed-in on your desired area, you turn on geography layers to find the geography code for your area.

Geographies

* Misc
	* ACS Geography Boundaries by Year ([link](http://census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/geography-acs/geography-boundaries-by-year-html))
* Types
	* Legal/Administrative
		* Census gets boundaries from outside party (state, county, city, etc.)
		* e.g. election areas, school districts, counties, county subdivisions
	* Statistical
		* Census creates these boundaries
		* e.g. regions, census tracts, ZCTAs, block groups, MSAs, urban areas
* Nested Areas![](./_resources/Surveys,_Census_Data.resources/Screenshot (697).png)
	* Census Tracts
		* Areas within a county
		* Around 1200 to 8000 people
		* Small towns, rural areas, neighborhoods
		* \*\* Census tracts may cross city boundaries \*\*
	* Block Groups
		* Areas within a census tract
		* Around 600 to 3000 people
	* Census Blocks
		* Areas within a block group
		* Not for ACS, only for the 10-yr census
* Places
	* Misc
		* One place cannot overlap another place
		* Expand and contract as population or commercial activity increases or decreases
		* Must represent an organized settlement of people living in close proximity.
	* Incorporated Places
		* cities, towns, villages
		* Updated through Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) yearly
	* Census Designated Places (CDPs)
		* Areas that can't become Incorporated Places because of state or city regulations
		* Concentrations of population, housing, commericial structures
		* Updated through Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) yearly
* County Subdivisions
	* Minor Civil Divisions (MCDs)
		* Legally defined by the state or county, stable entity. May have elected government
		* e.g. townships, charter townships, or districts
	* Census County Divisions (CCDs)
		* no population requirment
		* Subcounty units with stable boundaries and recognizable names
* Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)![](./_resources/Surveys,_Census_Data.resources/Screenshot (696).png)
	* Misc
		* [{]{style='color: #990000'}[crosswalkZCTA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zctaCrosswalk/index.html){style='color: #990000'}[}]{style='color: #990000'} - Contains the US Census Bureau's 2020 ZCTA to County Relationship File, as well as convenience functions to translate between States, Counties and ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)
	* Approximate USPS Code distribution for housing units
		* The most frequently occurring zip code within an census block is assigned to a census block
		* Then blocks are aggregated into areas (ZCTAs)
	* ZCTAs do NOT nest within any other geographies
		* I guess the aggregated ZCTA blocks can overlap block groups
	* 2010 ZCTAs exclude large bodies of water and unpopulated areas
