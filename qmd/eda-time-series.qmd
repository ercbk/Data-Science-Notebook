        -   Aggregated values are automatically created for each data field (column) depending on its contents (e.g. min/max/mean values for numeric data, no. of distinct values for categorical data)
        -   Overviews for missing values, non-conformant values, and duplicated rows.

## Basic Characteristics {#sec-eda-ts-basic .unnumbered}

-   [Plot series]{.underline}

    ``` r
    ts_tbl |> 
        timetk::plot_time_series(date, 
                                 value, 
                                 .smooth = T, 
                                 .smooth_span = 0.3, 
                                 .interactive = F)
    ```

    -   Includes a LOESS smoothing line. Control the curviness of LOESS using [smooth_span]{.arg-text}

-   [Missingness]{.underline}

    -   NAs affect the number of lags to be calculated for a variable
        -   e.g. exports only recorded quarterly but stock price has a monthly close price you want to predict. So if you're forecasting monthly oil price then creating a lagged variable for exports is difficult
            -   Bizsci (lab 29), minimum_lag = length_of_sequence_of_tail_NAs +1 
                -   tail(ts) are the most recent values
    -   Even if you don't want a lag for a predictor var and it has NAs, you need to `recipe::step_lag(var, lag = #_of_tail_NAs)`. So var has no NAs.
    -   Consider seasonality of series when determining imputation method

-   [Outcome Variable Distribution]{.underline}

    -   For low volume data, a right-skewed distribution might be needed instead of a Gaussian.

        -   Thin tails - Use a Gamma distribution
        -   Heavier tails - Use a Log Normal or the Inverse Gaussian

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highligh}\
        ![](_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/gghistogram-1.png){.lightbox width="432"}

        ``` r
        gghistogram(lynx, add.kde=TRUE)
        ```

        -   [add.normal]{.arg-text} adds a gaussian density

-   [Zeros]{.underline}

    -   See notebook for tests on the number of zeros in Poisson section
    -   Might be tests in the intermittent forecasting packages, so see bkmks
    -   If so, see [Logistics, Demand Forecasting \>\> Intermittent Demand](https://ercbk.github.io/Domain-Knowledge-Notebook/qmd/logistics-demand-planning.html#sec-log-demfcast-intdem){style="color: green"} for modeling approaches
    -   Are there gaps in the time series (e.g. missing a whole day/multiple days, days of shockingly low volume)?

-   [Is data recorded at irregular intervals]{.underline}. If so:

    -   [{{BINCOR}}]{style="color: goldenrod"}handles cross-correlation between 2 series with irregular intervals and series with regular but different intervals
    -   I think common forecasting algorithms require regularly spaced data, so look towards ML, Multilevel Model for Change (MLMC), or Latent Growth Models
    -   May also try binning points in the series (like BINCOR does) or smoothing them to get a regular interval

## Seasonality {#sec-eda-ts-seas .unnumbered}

-   [STL Decomposition]{.underline}
    -   Also see [Forecasting, Decomposition](forecasting-decomposition.qmd#sec-decomp){style="color: green"}

    -   If we are interested in short- or long-term movements of the time series, we do not care about the various seasonalities. We want to know the trend component of the time series and if it has reached a turning point

    -   Is there strong seasonality or trend?

    -   If there's a pattern in the random/remainder component, this could indicate that there are other strong influences present.

    -   Example: {timetk}\
        ![](_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/timetk-stl-decomp-1.jpg){.lightbox width="487"}

        ``` r
        ts_tbl %>%
            plot_stl_diagnostics(
                date, value,
                .feature_set = c("observed", "season", "trend", "remainder"),
                .trend       = 180,
                .frequency   = 30,
                .interactive = F
            )
        ```

    -   [Daily Seasonal Adjustment (DSA)]{.underline}

        -   Used to remove seasonal and calendar effects from time series data with daily observations. This allows you to analyze the underlying trends and patterns in the data without being masked by predictable fluctuations like weekdays, weekends, holidays, or seasonal changes.
        -   In a EDA context, the deseasonalized series can be used to locate the time series trend (daily data is very noisy), identify turning points, and compare components with other series.
        -   Packages: [{dsa}]{style="color: #990000"}
        -   Notes from [Seasonal Adjustment of Daily Time Series](https://towardsdatascience.com/seasonal-adjustment-of-daily-time-series-1bd2aa9b096d)
            -   Example shows it outperforming Hyndman's STR procedure in extracting seasonal components more completely.
        -   Daily data can have multiple seasonalities present

                ![](_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/dsa-example-1.webp){.lightbox width="632"}
        -   Combines the seasonal trend decomposition procedure using Loess (STL) with a regression model with ARIMA errors
        -   Procedure
            -   STL adjusts intra-weekly periodic patterns.
            -   RegARIMA estimates calendar effects, cross-seasonal effects, and outliers.
            -   STL adjusts intra-monthly periodic effects.
            -   STL adjusts intra-annual effects
-   [Seasonality Tests]{.underline} (weekly, monthly, and yearly)
    -   [{seastests}]{style="color: #990000"} QS and Friedman (see bkmk in Time Series \>\> eda for example)
    -   QS test's null hypothesis is no positive autocorrelation in seasonal lags in the time series
    -   Friedman test's null hypothesis is no significant differences between the values' period-specific means present in the time series
    -   For QS and Friedman, pval \> 0.05 indicates NO seasonality present
-   [Additive or Multiplicative Structure]{.underline}
    -   Is the variance (mostly) constant (Additive) or not constant (Multiplicative) over time?
    -   Does the amplitude of the seasonal or cyclical component increase over time? ![](./_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/Screenshot%20(248).png){.lightbox width="432"}
        -   The amplitude of the seasonal component increases over time so this series has a multiplicative structure
        -   Also multiplicative, if there's a changing seasonal amplitude for different times of the year
    -   If you have a multiplicative structure and zeros in your data (i.e. intermittent data), then they must handled in some way.
        -   See [Logistics](Logistics) \>\> Demand Forecasting \>\> Intermittent Data

## Groups {#sec-eda-ts-group .unnumbered}

-   [Quantile values per frequency unit (by group and total)]{.underline}
    -   {timetk::plot_time_series_boxplot}

    -   Average closing price for each month, each day of the month, each day of the week

    -   When are dips and peaks?

    -   Which groups are similar

    -   What are the potential reasons behind these dips and peaks?

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Daily Power Consumption\
        ![](./_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/1-mDCO3WKk5gqfK-k-pf-p0g.jpeg)

        -   Median, the lower quartile, and the upper quartile for Saturdays and Sundays are below the remaining weekdays when inspecting daily power consumption
        -   Some outliers are present during the week, which could indicate lower power consumption due to moving holidays
            -   Moving holidays are holidays which occur each year, but where the exact timing shifts (e.g. Easter)

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: {timetk} Calendar Effects\
        ![](_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/timetk-calendar-effects.jpg){.lightbox width="486"}

        ``` r
        ts_tbl %>%
            plot_seasonal_diagnostics(date, value, .interactive = F)
        ```

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Monthly Power Consumption![](./_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/1-ZKjg0i7fLRIWrys8phtCiw.jpeg)

        -   Median, the lower quartile, and the upper quartile of power consumption are lower during the spring and summer than autumn and winter

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Demand per Month and per Category![](./_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/image.2.png)
-   [Variance of value by group]{.underline}
    -   Example: how sales vary between store types over a year
        -   Important to standardize the value by group
            -   `df %>% group_by(group) %>% mutate(sales = scale(sales))`
        -   Which groups vary wildly and which are more stable
-   [Rates by group]{.underline}
    -   Example: sales(\$) per customer
        -   `df %>% group_by(group, month) %>% mutate(sales_per_cust = sum(sales)/sum(customers)`

        -   There does seem to be some variance. An interaction between autocorrelation and the cateogorical variable might be predictive of a heart murmur event.
-   [Trend Strength and Seasonal Strength plots]{.underline}
    -   {tsfeatures} has seasonality strength metric
-   [Shannon Spectral Entropy]{.underline}
    -   `feasts::feat_spectral`  will compute the (Shannon) spectral entropy of a time series, which is a measure of how easy the series is to forecast.
    -   A series which has strong trend and seasonality (and so is easy to forecast) will have entropy close to 0.
    -   A series that is very noisy (and so is difficult to forecast) will have entropy close to 1.

        -   Holiday series behave quite differently from the rest of the series. Almost all of the holiday series appear in the top half of the plot, while almost all of the remaining series appear in the bottom half of the plot.
        -   Clearly, the second principal component is distinguishing between holidays and other types of travel.
        -   The four points where PC1 \> 10 stand out as outliers.

    -   Why might these series be identified as unusual?

        -   Holiday visits to the south coast of NSW is highly seasonal but has almost no trend, whereas most holiday destinations in Australia show some trend over time.
        -   Melbourne is an unusual holiday destination because it has almost no seasonality, whereas most holiday destinations in Australia have highly seasonal tourism.
        -   The north western corner of Western Australia is unusual because it shows an increase in business tourism in the last few years of data, but little or no seasonality.
        -   The south western corner of Western Australia is unusual because it shows both an increase in holiday tourism in the last few years of data and a high level of seasonality.

## Association {#sec-eda-ts-assoc .unnumbered}

-   See [Association, Time Series](association-time-series.qmd#sec-assoc-ts){style="color: green"}
-   [Lag Scatter Plots]{.underline}
    -   Lag scatterplots between target series and lags of the target series (i.e. y~t~ vs y~t+h~)\
        ![](_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/astsa-lag1-1.png){.lightbox width="532"}

        ``` r

        astsa::lag1.plot(soi, 12, col=astsa.col(4, .3), pch=20, cex=2) # prettified
        ```

        -   Autocorrelation values in upper right corner
            -   Autocorrelations/Cross-Correlation values only valid if relationships are linear but maybe still useful in determining a positive or negative relationship
        -   LOESS smoothing line added
        -   Nonlinear patterns can indicate that behavior between the two variables is different for high values and low values

    -   Lag scatterplots between target series and lags of the predictor Series (i.e. y~t~ vs x~t+h~)\
        ![](_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/astsa-lag2-1.png){.lightbox width="532"}

        ``` r

        ```

        -   If either series has autocorrelation, then it should be prewhitened before being inputted into the function.
            -   See [Association, Time Series \>\> CCF](association-time-series.qmd#cross-correlation-function-ccf){style="color: green"}
        -   Cross-Correlation (CCF) values in upper right corner
            -   Autocorrelations/Cross-Correlation values only valid if relationships are linear but maybe still useful in determining a positive or negative relationship
        -   Nonlinear patterns can indicate that behavior between the two variables is different for high values and low values
-   [Partial Autocorrelation]{.underline}
    -   Removes the correlation between $y_{t-k}$ and lags before it ($y_{t-(k-1)}, \ldots, y_{t-1}$) to get a more accurate correlation between y~t~ and y~t-k~. Sort of like a partial correlation but for a univariate time series.

    -   Can be interpreted as the amount correlation between y~t-k~ and y~t~ thats not explained by the previous lags.

    -   Example: `forecast::Pacf(plot = TRUE)` or `forecast::ggPacf`\

        -   Contains several features involving partial autocorrelations including:
            -   The sum of squares of the first five partial autocorrelations for the original series
            -   The first-differenced series and the second-differenced series.
            -   For seasonal data, it also includes the partial autocorrelation at the first seasonal lag.

## Stationarity {#sec-eda-ts-station .unnumbered}

-   CCF and most statistical and ML models need or prefer stationary time series.
-   [ACF]{.underline}
    -   For a stationary series, the ACF will drop to zero relatively quickly, while the ACF of non-stationary data decreases slowly.

    -   For a non-stationary series:

        -   The value of r1 (correlation between y~t~ and y~t-1~) is often large and positive.
        -   A steady, slow decline towards 0 indicates trend is present
            -   Is the series a trend-stationary or unit root process?
                -   Test all series of interest with ADF and KPSS tests (See [Forecasting, Statistical \>\> Preprocessing](forecasting-statistical.qmd#sec-fcast-stat-preproc){style="color: green"} \>\> Detrend or Difference
        -   A scalloped pattern indicates seasonality is present

    -   95% CIs are $\pm \frac{1.96}{\sqrt{T}}$ where $T$ is the length of the time series.

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: `forecast::Acf(plot = TRUE)` or `forecast::ggAcf`

        ![](./_resources/EDA,_Time_Series.resources/acfstationary-1.png){.lightbox width="632"}

        -   The ACF of the differenced Google stock price (right fig) looks just like that of a white noise series. There are no autocorrelations lying outside the 95% limits, and the Ljung-Box 
        -   Q∗ statistic (Ljung-Box) has a p-value of 0.355 (for h = 10) which implies the ts is stationary. This suggests that the daily change in the Google stock price is essentially a random amount which is uncorrelated with that of previous days.
-   [Ljeung-Box]{.underline}
    -   `stats::Box.test` or `feasts::ljung_box`
        -   [x]{.arg-text}: numeric or univariate ts
        -   [lag]{.arg-text}: Recommended 10 for non-seasonal, 2m (e.g. m = 12 for monthly series, m = 4 for quarterly), maximum is T/5 where T is the length of the series.
        -   [type]{.arg-text}: "Lj"
    -   Interpretation: small Q\* or p-value \> 0.05 means the time series is stationary.
