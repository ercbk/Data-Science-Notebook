**Misc**



**Kullback-Lieber Divergence**

* Measures the similarity between the joint probability density function and the product of the individual density functions
	* If they're the same, then both variables are independent
* Also see [Statistical Rethinking](Statistical Rethinking) >> Ch 7
* Example: Measuring Segregation
	from [Did Residential Racial Segregation in the U.S. Really Increase?](https://elbersb.de/public/posts/segregation-increase/)

	* p(g|u) is the proportion of a racial group, g, in a neighborhood, u
	* p(g) is the overall proportion of that racial group in the metropolitan area
	* This is a sum of scores across all racial groups of a neighborhood, u


**Mutual Information**

* Measures how dependent two random variables are on one another
	* Accounts for linear and non-linear dependence
* If the mutual information is 0, the variables are independent, otherwise there is some dependence.
* Example: Measuring Segregation (see example in Kullback-Lieber Divergence section)![](./_resources/Information_Theory.resources/Screenshot (367).png)
	* Lu see above
	* p(u) is described as the "size of the neighborhood"
		* Not sure if this is a count or a proportion of the population of the neighborhood to the population of the metropolitan area. Both may end up in the same place.
	* This is a sum of scores across all neighborhoods in a metropolitan area
		* So the neighborhood scores are weighted by neighborhood population and summed for an overall metropolitan score
		* L(u) is affected by the smallest racial proportion (see article) for that metropolitan area, so unless these are the same, you can't compare metropolitan areas with this number. But you can use these numbers to see how a metro's (or neighborhood's) diversity has changed over time.
