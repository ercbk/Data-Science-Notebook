## Generalized Joint Regression Modelling (GJRM) {#sec-reg-multivar-gjrm .unnumbered}

-   A flexible statistical framework that generalizes classical regression models to jointly model multiple responses (or multi-response), potentially of different types, while accounting for dependencies between them.
    -   It is particularly useful when you have multiple outcomes (e.g., continuous, binary, count data) that may influence each other.
    -   Handles nonlinear associations between the reponse variables

-   Comparison to a Gaussian Multivariate Regression Model
    -   Allows for more flexible marginal distributions, not limited to normal distributions.
    -   Dependence Structure
        -   Multivariate regression models the correlation between responses using a multivariate normal distribution, which implies a linear association.
        -   GJRM uses copulas to model the dependence structure, allowing for more complex, non-linear associations between responses.
    -   Flexibility
        -   In multivariate regression with splines, the same spline structure is typically applied across all response variables..
        -   In GJRM, each marginal can have its own unique non-linear structure, potentially using different splines or smoothing approaches for each response variable.
    -   GJRM allows different link functions for each marginal distribution, accommodating various types of responses and not just continuous responses
    -   GJRM can handle mixed types of responses (e.g., a combination of continuous, binary, and count data) in a single model.
-   Steps
    -   First stage: Models each marginal distribution separately, allowing for different distributions and link functions for each response.
    -   Second stage: Combines these marginals using a copula function to create the joint distribution.
