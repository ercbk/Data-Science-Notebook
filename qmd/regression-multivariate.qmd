* Nested Dichotomies
	* A system of nested dichotomies is a binary tree that recursively splits a set of classes from a mult-class classification problem into smaller and smaller subsets.
	* Binary logistic models are fit to individual dichotomous classification problems at the tree's internal nodes.
	* Only recommended if a particular choice of dichotomies is substantially compelling based on domain knowledge.
	* If no particular tree structure is preferred over another, then an ensemble nested models is recommended.
