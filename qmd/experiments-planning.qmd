    -   Sampling Bias - The probability distribution in the collected dataset deviates from its true natural distribution one would actually observe in the wilderness.
    -   Spectrum Bias - Whenever a distribution which a model has been trained with changes, e.g. due to spatial or temporal effects, the validity of this model expires. (model drift?)
-   Check randomization procedure by testing for pairwise associations between the treatment variable and the adjustment variables. If independence is rejected (pval \< 0.05), then randomization failed.

    -   The false positive rate is closely associated with the "statistical significance" of the observed difference in metric values between the treatment and control groups, which we measure using the p-value.
        -   FPR typically set to 5% (i.e. falsely conclude that there is a "statistically significant" difference 5% of the time)
    -   False negatives are closely related to the statistical concept of power, which gives the probability of a true positive given the experimental design and a true effect of a specific size
        -   Power = 1 - FNR
-   Biostatistical Endpoints (outcome variables)
    -   From [Harrell](https://hbiostat.org/talks/collab.html#13)
    -   Considerations (Also See [hbiostat.org/endpoint](https://hbiostat.org/endpoint))
        -   Don't use Y that means different things to different subjects
            -   E.g.: impact of time to doubling of SCr depends on initial SCr
            -   Time to recovery must be shorter for minimally diseased pts
        -   Instead of change from baseline use raw response and covariate adjust for baseline
        -   Treat longitudinal data as longitudinal
    -   Bad Endpoints
        -   Change from baseline and % change
        -   Time until the first of several types of events
            -   Especially when some events are recurrent or events have differing severities
        -   Time to recovery
            -   Ignores unrecovery, close calls, and can't handle interrupting events
        -   Time until a lab value is in a normal or an abnormal range
        -   Time to doubling of serum creatinine
        -   Acute kidney injury (standard AKI definitions)
        -   Ventilator-free days
        -   Most ratios
        -   BMI when it doesn't adequately summarize weight and height
        -   Not Y=BMI; analyze weight, covariate adjusted for initial weight, height, age
-   Traditional two-arm randomized controlled trials are not an optimal choice when multiple experimental arms are available for testing efficacy. In such situations, a multiple-arm trial should be preferred, which allows simultaneous comparison of multiple experimental arms with a common control and provides a substantial efficiency advantage.In multi-arm trials, several arms are monitored in a group sequential fashion, with ineffective arms being dropped out of the study. Therefore, multi-arm trials offer a more efficient, cost-effective, and patient-centered approach to clinical research, with the potential to identify superior treatments more reliably than traditional two-arm trials.

## Considerations {#sec-exp-plan-cons .unnumbered}

-   Metrics
    -   If using multiple metrics/KPIs, make sure that you and the product manager agree on which metric/KPI should be primary and which should be secondary.
-   Where do users get **randomized**? Can depend on the KPI you're measuring.
    -   App or website login - appropriate for product purchasing
    -   A click on the first screen of the signup flow - appropriate for app subscriptions
-   Will you only be testing a **subset** of your customers?
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Testing changes in one country or platform and apply the learnings from the test before releasing them to our remaining users
    -   May affect the baseline KPI used to calculate the sample size
        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: if a new feature is only going to be tested for English users on iOS the conversion rate may be different than the rate for all users on iOS. This also affects the number of users expected to enter the test because more users logged into iOS versus just English users.
-   Calculate **sample size**
    -   May take months to reach the sample size needed to determine statistical significance of a measured effect
    -   (Approx) Sample Size
        -   See Sample Size/Power/MDE
    -   Issues
        -   Getting more samples or running an experiment for a longer time to increase the sample size might not always be easy or feasible
    -   If your sample size is large and therefore test duration is too long, you may need to change the metric/KPI you're measuring
        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}
            -   KPI: test whether new feature increased the percentage of new users that returned to the app 30 days after signup.
            -   This meant the test needed to run an additional 30 days to ensure new users in the control didn't get exposed to the new feature within the 30-day engagement window we wanted to measure.
-   Does the time of year matter?
    -   Is there a **seasonality** aspect to your KPI, customer engagement, etc.?
        -   If so, the treatment effect may differ depending on when the test is conducted
-   Monitoring
    -   Confirm group/cohort proportions
        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: If you have 3 treatments (aka variants) and 1 control, make sure each group has 25% of the test participants
        -   Unbalanced groups can result in violations of assumptions for the statistical tests used on the results
    -   Track KPIs
        -   Very bad treatments could substantially affect KPIs negatively. So you need to pull the plug if your business starts to tank.

-   Underpowered Experiments
    -   "In particular, if your data are noisy relative to the size of the effects you can reasonably expect to find, then it's a big mistake to use any sort of certainty thresholding (whether that be p-values, confidence intervals, posterior intervals, Bayes factors, or whatever) in your summary and reporting. That would be a disaster---type M and S errors will kill you.

        So, if you expect ahead of time that the study will be summarized by statistical significance or some similar thresholding, then I think it's a bad idea to do the underpowered study. But if you expect ahead of time that the raw data will be reported and that any summaries will be presented without selection, then the underpowered study is fine." [Gelman](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/08/28/there-are-no-underpowered-datasets-there-are-only-underpowered-analyses/)

### Approximate Sample Size {#sec-exp-plan-smppow-apxsmp .unnumbered}

-   80% Power
    -   Formula\
        $$
        n = \frac{8}{\mbox{Effect Size}^2}
        $$
        -   You can substitute correlation (?) for effect size
    -   Difference between means of two groups\
        $$
        n = \frac{32}{\mbox{Effect Size}^2}
        $$
    -   Using variance\
        $$
        n = \frac{16\sigma^2}{\delta^2}
        $$
        -   $\sigma$ is variance of the data (outcome?)
        -   $\delta$ is the effect size
-   90% Power\
    $$
    n = \frac{11}{\mbox{Effect Size}^2}
    $$
-   Bayesian
    -   From <https://www.rdatagen.net/post/2021-06-01-bayesian-power-analysis/>
    -   Bayesian inference is agnostic to any pre-specified sample size and is not really affected by how frequently you look at the data along the way
    -   A bayesian power analysis to calculate a desired sample size entails using the posterior distribution probability threshold (or another criteria such as the variance of the posterior distribution or the length of the 95% credible interval)
-   **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)** is proportional to 1/sqrt(sample_size)
-   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: [Gelman](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/07/01/the-value-of-thinking-about-varying-treatment-effects-coronavirus-example/) (Confirming sample size of 126 has 80% power)
    -   Assumption: drug (binary treatment) increased survival rate by 25 percentage points (i.e. treatment effect)
        -   Evidently for a survival model, but Gelman uses standard z-test gaussian power calculation. So, I guess the survival model part doesn't matter.
    -   "With 126 people divided evenly in two groups, the standard error of the difference in proportions is bounded above by $\sqrt{0.5 \cdot 0.5 /63 + 0.5 \cdot 0.5 /63} = 0.089$, so an effect of 0.25 is at least 2.8 standard errors from zero, which is the condition for 80% power for the z-test."
        -   SE for the difference in 2 proportions\
            $$
            \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}
            $$
            -   In the example, the experiment is balanced so both the treatment and control groups have an equal number of participants (i.e. 63 in each group which is a 0.5 proportion of the total sample size)
        -   0.25 / 0.089 = 2.8 s.d. from 0
    -   Gelman's [Explanation](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/03/15/need-16-times-sample-size-estimate-interaction-estimate-main-effect/): "If you have 80% power, then the underlying effect size for the main effect is 2.8 standard errors from zero. That is, the z-score has a mean of 2.8 and standard deviation of 1, and there's an 80% chance that the z-score exceeds 1.96 (in R, `pnorm(2.8, 1.96, 1, lower.tail = F)` = 0.8)."
        -   [Explanation](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/449697/a-power-of-0-8-implies-a-main-effect-of-2-8) of the Explanation: "A two-tail hypothesis with a significance level of 0.05 are assumed. The right-tail critical value is 1.96. The power is the mass of the sampling distribution under the alternative to the right of this decision boundary. Then we want to find a Gaussian with a standard deviation of 1 so that 80% of its mass is to the right of 1.96. Then a mean of 2.8 gives the desired outcome."
        -   Also see Notebook pg 95

### Increasing Power {#sec-exp-plan-smppow-incpwr .unnumbered}

-   Increase the expected magnitude of the effect size by:
    -   Being bold vs incremental with the hypotheses you test.
    -   Testing in new areas of the product
        -   Likely more room for larger improvements in member satisfaction
-   Increase sample size
    -   Allocate more members (or other units) to the test
    -   Reduce the number of test groups
        -   There is a tradeoff between the sample size in each test and the number of non-overlapping tests that can be run at the same time.
-   Test in groups where the effect is homogenous
    -   Increases power by effectively lowering the variability of the effect in the test population
    -   Netflix [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01305.pdf)
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Testing a feature that improves latency
        -   e.g. The delay between a member pressing play and video playback commencing
        -   Latency effects are likely to substantially differ across devices and types of internet connections
        -   Solution: Run the test on a set of members that used similar devices with similar web connections

## Collection {#sec-exp-plan-olctn .unnumbered}

-   Record data; don't calculate or transform it
    -   If possible, store data as text or in text compatible format. (i.e. .csv, .tsv, or some other delimited file)
        -   Some other formats add trailing spaces, etc.
-   Back up data
    -   Multiple places is recommended
-   Curate Data Organization
    -   Clean data with simple organization fosters its use and a shared understanding of procedures and analysis.
    -   Observations, cases, or units, etc. appear in rows
    -   Variables appear in columns
    -   Values for observations on variables appear in the matrix of cells between them
    -   Nesting structure (i.e. grouping variables) should appear in columns, not rows.
    -   Beware complicated row, column, or value labels.
        -   Row, column, or value labels with case sensitive characters, special characters, or whitespace cause problems in analytical software beyond the spreadsheet (they can be a problem within the spreadsheet as well)
        -   Use lower cases that fully denote the observation, variable, or label, unless data is used as-is.
        -   Avoid spaces.
        -   Use underscores rather than periods to indicate white space.
        -   Avoid special characters --- "percent" or "pct" is better than "%."
-   All calculations should occur outside the data repository
    -   \*\* Keep an original, un-adulterated copy of the data in a separate sheet or file \*\*
    -   Carrying calculations, summaries, and analysis within the data structure gets in the way of efficient updating.
    -   Updating an analysis means merely updating the data set (again in the native form) called by the procedure if scripts and functions are well-documented.
    -   Automating reporting and analysis is a big deal in both the public and private sectors.
-   Do not summarize data during collection (unless the need is pressing)

## Post-Experiment Evaluation Checklist {#sec-exp-plan-peec .unnumbered}

-   Did the test run long enough so that the sample size reached?
-   Are treatment variants proportioned correctly?
-   Did users get exposed to multiple treatment variants and how many?

## Decreasing the Sampling Variance of the Treatment Effect {#sec-exp-plan-dsvte .unnumbered}

### Misc {#sec-exp-plan-dsvte-misc .unnumbered}

-   Notes from [Online Experiments Tricks --- Variance Reduction](https://towardsdatascience.com/online-experiments-tricks-variance-reduction-291b6032dcd7)
-   Alternative to increasing power
-   Winsorize ([{]{style="color: #990000"}[DescTools::Winsorize](https://andrisignorell.github.io/DescTools/reference/Winsorize.html){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"}), dichotomizing, etc. metrics will help decrease the variance significantly, but introduce more bias
-   CUPED is widely used and productionalized in tech companies and ML-based methods are often used to incorporate multiple covariates. (see below)

### Stratified Sampling {#sec-exp-plan-dsvte-strat .unnumbered}

![](./_resources/Experiments,_General.resources/0-J8zjvPFHFXLzz8S-.png){.lightbox width="332"}

-   See [Surveys, Sampling Methods \>\> Probabilistic Sampling Methods \>\> Stratified Sampling](surveys-sampling-methods.qmd#sec-surv-sampmeth-probsamp-strat){style="color: green"}
-   Pro - Provides an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect and effectively removes the between-strata variance
-   Con - Very hard to implement stratified sampling *before* experiments

### Post-Stratification {#sec-exp-plan-dsvte-pstrat .unnumbered}

![](./_resources/Experiments,_General.resources/0-pIj3JA8zlR7tiBb8.png){.lightbox width="332"}

-   Post-stratification randomly samples the population first and then places individuals into strata.
-   The Effect is measured as a difference in means between treated and untreated
-   Steps
    1.  Randomly sample population then allocate individuals into strata
    2.  Randomly assign treatment to all individuals all together
        -   She didn't do the assignment per strata which I'm not sure is correct.Â  You could get a long run of 1s for one strata and a long run of zeros for another strata.
    3.  Run experiment
    4.  For each strata
        -   Calculate mean outcome for treated and mean outcome for untreated
        -   Calculate the difference in mean outcomes
    5.  Take the mean of the differences for the average treatment effect (ATE)
        -   Denominator is the number of strata
-   In the example, the procedure was simulated multiple times to get an ATE distribution
    -   I guess you could bootstrap or use [{emmeans}]{style="color: #990000"} to CIs, pvals, etc.

### CUPED {#sec-exp-plan-dsvte-cuped .unnumbered}

-   CUPED stands for Controlled-Experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data
-   Misc
    -   This [blog post](https://j-sephb-lt-n.github.io/exploring_statistics/cuped_cupac_and_other_variance_reduction_techniques.html#controlvariates) goes through the algebra extending CUPED from one covariate, $X$, to multiple covariates.\
    -   Also see [Understanding CUPED](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-cuped-a822523641af)
-   Optimization
    -   Formula

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        &Y_{\text{cuped}} = Y - \theta X \\
        &\mbox{Var}(Y_{\text{cuped}}) = \mbox{Var}(Y) - 2\theta \mbox{Cov}(X, Y) + \theta^2\mbox{Var}(X)
        \end{aligned}
        $$

    -   To minimize $\mbox{Var}(Y_{\text{cuped}})$, we choose\
        $$
        \theta = \frac{\mbox{Cov}(X, Y)}{\mbox{Var}(X)}
        $$

    -   Then $\mbox{Var}(Y_{\text{cuped}})_{\text{min}} = \mbox{Var}(Y)(1-\mbox{Corr}(X,Y))$
-   $Y$ is the outcome variable
-   $X$ is pre-experiment values of the outcome variable
    -   So, you'd need as many pre-experiment values as observed values during the experiment.
        -   ...and potentially the same individuals? Probably not necessary but desirable.
    -   When no pre-experiment values of the outcome variable exist, a variable highly correlated to the outcome variable that's NOT RELATED TO THE EXPERIMENT can be used.
        -   Like an instrument from an IV model.
        -   Can use ML to construct the control variate. (see CUPAC below)
-   Steps
    -   Randomly assign treatment to individuals
    -   Perform experiment
    -   Calculate $\theta$ (eq.3)
    -   Calculate $Y_{\text{cuped}}$ (eq.1)
    -   Calculate the effect size by taking the difference between the treated $Y_{\text{cuped}}$ mean and the untreated $Y_{\text{cuped}}$ mean

### Variance-Weighted Estimators {#sec-exp-plan-dsvte-vwe .unnumbered}

-   Variance is reduced by calculating a weighted variance based on the variance of an individual's pre-experiment data\
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    &Y_i = \alpha + \delta_i Z_i + \epsilon_i \\
    &\quad \text{where} \; \epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_i^2)\\
    &\mbox{Var}(\hat \delta) = \sum_{i} w_i^2 \mbox{Var}(\delta_i) = \sum_{i} w_i^2 \sigma_i^2
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    -   $Y$ is the outcome variable
    -   $Z$ is the treatment indicator
    -   $\delta$ is the treatment effect
    -   $\sigma_i^2$ is the pre-experiment variance of individual $i$'s data
        -   Alternative ways of estimating the variance include ML models and using Empirical Bayes estimators ([Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3391403.3399542))
-   Steps
    -   Calculate individual variances, $\sigma_i^2$
    -   Bucket individuals into $k$ strata based on their variances
    -   Calculate the mean of each strata's variance, stratak_mean_variance
    -   Randomly assign treatment to individuals
    -   Perform experiment
    -   For each strata
        -   Calculate the effect for each strata by taking the difference between the treated mean $Y$ and untreated mean $Y$
        -   Calculate strata weight\
            $$
            w_k = \frac{1}{\text{strata}_k \_\text{mean\_variance}}
            $$
        -   Calculate weighted effect for strata $k$, $\delta_{w,k} = \delta_k  w_k$
    -   Calculate variance weighted treatment effect by adding all the weighted effects and dividing it by the sum of the weights\
        $$
        \delta_w = \frac{\sum\delta_{w,k}}{\sum w_k}
        $$
-   Pros and Cons
    -   The variance-weighted estimator models individual pre-experiment variance as weight and it can be used as a nice extension to other methods such as CUPED.
        -   I guess you just calculate ($k \cdot Y_{\text{cuped}}$) and then do the weighting procedure. $\theta$ and $X$ shouldn't be affected --- just some grouped calculations.
    -   It works well when there is a highly skewed variance between users and when the pre-treatment variance is a good indicator of the post-treatment variance.
        -   Not sure what exactly is meant by "highly skewed variance between users." Most users have high or most users have low variance for the pre-experiment data?
    -   When the variance of the pre-treatment variance is low or when the pre- and post-experiment variances are not consistent, the variance-weighted estimator might not work.
    -   The variance-weighted estimator is not unbiased. Managing bias is important for this method.

### CUPAC {#sec-exp-plan-dsvte-cupac .unnumbered}

-   Control Using Predictions As Covariates
-   ML extension of CUPED ([Paper](https://doordash.engineering/2020/06/08/improving-experimental-power-through-control-using-predictions-as-covariate-cupac/))
-   Assuming we have pre-experiment metrics, X1, X2, X3, and X4. Essentially, what this method does is to use some machine learning model to predict Y using X1, X2, X3, and X4. And then, we can use the predicted value as the control covariate in CUPED.
