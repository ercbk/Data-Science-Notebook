Misc

* A model is said to be hierarchical if it contains all the lesser degree terms in the hierarchy
	* Example
		* hierarchical: y = x + x2 + x3 + x4
		* not hierarchical: y = x + x4
		* hierarchical: y = x1 + x2 + x1x2
		* not hierarchical: y = x1 + x1x2
	* It is expected that all polynomial models should have this property because only hierarchical models are invariant under linear transformation.
