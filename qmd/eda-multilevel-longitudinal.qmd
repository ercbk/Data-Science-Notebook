-   Need to figure out if
    -   There's significant within-unit variation. If so, then FE model will likely be the best model
        -   [Article](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/06/fixed-effects-vs-random-effects-for-web-browsing-data-a-simulation/) with simulated data showed that within variation around sd \< 0.5 didn't detect the effect of explanatory variable but ymmv (depends on \# of units, observations per unit, N)
    -   There's significant between-unit variation. If so, then RE model will likely be the best model

## Multilevel {#sec-eda-multlong-mult .unnumbered}

-   [Misc]{.underline}
    -   Also see [Regression, Ordinal \>\> EDA](regression-ordinal.qmd#sec-reg-ord-eda){style="color: green"} \>\> Crosstabs
    -   Is my data clustered?
    -   Separate variables into levels
        -   [**Level One**]{style="color: #009499"}: Variables measured at the most frequently occurring observational unit
            -   i.e. Variables that (for the most part) have different values for each row
            -   i.e. Vary for each repeated measure of a subject and vary between subjects
        -   [**Level Two**]{style="color: #009499"}: Variables measured on larger observational units
            -   i.e. Constant for each repeated measure of a subject but vary between each subject

### Univariate {#sec-eda-multlong-mult-uni .unnumbered}

-   Level 1 and Level 2
    -   Group-level correlation or autocorrelation in variables can mislead or obscure patterns
        -   If level 2 variable categories are pretty well balanced and there's sufficient data, then plotting means can remove the correlation affect in the plot
    -   Continuous
        -   Looking at the skew, median/mean, bimodal or not
        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}:\
            ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.png){.lightbox width="432"}
            -   (Top) Each observation is plotted as if each observation is independent of the other
                -   \* Ignores dependency (via repeated measures)
            -   (Bottom) Means for each subject or case or other level of a random variable
                -   \* Removes dependency
            -   Interpretation: Right skew remains in both plots but plot 1's decrease is smoother than plot 2's
    -   Categorical
        -   Calculate proportions of each category and noting trends (ordinal variables) or severe imbalances

### Bivariate {#sec-eda-multlong-mult-bi .unnumbered}

-   Questions
    -   Is there is a general trend suggesting that as the covariate increases the response either increases or decreases (trend)
    -   Do subjects at certain levels of the covariate tend to have similar mean values of the response (low variability)
    -   Is the variation in the response at different levels of the covariate (unequal variability)
-   Me: Comparison between plots that take into account dependency and the same plot that doesn't
    -   Trend in plot that ignores dependency but no trend in plot that removes dependency
        -   May indicate within-subject variation
    -   No trend in plot that ignores dependency but trend in plot that removes dependency
        -   May indicate between-subject variation
-   Boxplots (Categorical)\
    ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.2.png){.lightbox width="532"}
    -   Level 1 categorical covariates (y-axis) vs continuous outcome (x-axis)
    -   \* Ignores dependency (via repeated measures)
    -   Interpretation
        -   Left: ordinal covariate, medians are close and boxes pretty much contained within each other but there might be a trend
        -   Right: Looks like some decent variation between categories
    -   Mean outcome (per subject) vs covariate\
        ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.6.png){.lightbox width="432"}
        -   \* Removes dependency
        -   Interpretation: looks like some decent variation between categories
-   Scatter (Continuous)\
    ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.3.png){.lightbox width="432"}
    -   Level 1 continuous covariate (x-axis) vs continuous outcome (y-axis)
    -   \* Ignores dependency (via repeated measures)
    -   Actually a discrete  covariate being treated as continuous the fact that does seem to be a small trend is what's important
    -   Mean outcome (per subject) vs covariate\
        ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.7.png){.lightbox width="532"}
        -   \* Removes dependency
        -   Interpretation: PEM not showing much of an correlation if any
-   Facetting previous plots by subject\
    ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.5.png){.lightbox width="532"}\
    ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.4.png){.lightbox width="532"}
    -   Left
        -   Mostly downward trends but some upward trends
        -   Useful for prior formulation
        -   Gives an idea about the uncertainty of the slope of this variable
    -   Right
        -   Scarcity of points for some categories makes boxplots a bad idea
        -   Difficult to spot any trends
    -   \* Removes dependency

### Trivariate {#sec-eda-multlong-mult-tri .unnumbered}

-   Scatter, color by random variable\
    ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.1.png){.lightbox width="432"}

    -   Variables
        -   "points per 60 min" (outcome)
        -   "time on ice" (fixed effect)
        -   facetted by "position" (fixed effect)
        -   colored by "player" (potential random variable)
    -   Interpretation
        -   Theres does seem to be clustering by "player" therefore a mixed effects model might be a good choice.

-   Scatter with linear smooths ([link](https://biol609.github.io/lab/alt_to_rethinking.html#let-start-with-a-simple-example---rikz))\
    ![](_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/mlev-triv-scatter-lm-1.jpeg){.lightbox width="432"}

    ``` r
    theme_set(theme_classic(base_size = 14))
    ggplot(d, aes(x = NAP, y = log_richness, color = Beach_c)) +
      geom_point() +
      stat_smooth(method = "lm", alpha = 0.1) +
      scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")
    ```

    -   Shows the varying slopes and some varying intercepts (but an overall trend) by random variable, [Beach_c]{.var-text}

-   Null Model (aka random intercept-only model)

    ``` r
    m0 <- 
      lmer(pp60 ~ 1 + (1 | player), 
           data = df)

    jtools::summ(m0)
    GROUPING VARIABLES
    GROUP # GROUPS ICC
    player       20      0.89
    ```

    -   ICC \> 0.1 is generally accepted as the minimal threshold for justifying the use of Mixed Effects model (See ICC section)

    -   Looking for change from the initial measurement to the final measurement

### Linear parameters {#sec-eda-multlong-long-linpar .unnumbered}

-   Fit a linear regression *for each subject/unit* with its repeated measurements
    -   See univariate \>\> numerical outcome vs. time \>\> Facetted by observational unit \>\> (left) linear fit
-   [Advantages]{.underline}
    -   Each unit's/subject's data points can be summarized with two summary statistics---an intercept and a slope
        -   Bigger advantage when there are more observations over time per unit/subject
    -   Seems like a good way for using empirical bayes (i.e. use these distributions for prior specifications)
-   [Disadvantages]{.underline}
    -   Slopes cannot be estimated for those units/subjects with just a single observation
    -   R-squared values cannot be calculated for those units/subjects with no variability in test scores during the time period
    -   R-squared values must be 1 for those units/subjects with only two test scores.
-   [Summary Statistics]{.underline}
    -   Mean and SD for intercepts and slopes
-   [Univariate]{.underline}
    -   $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \epsilon_t$
        -   $t$ is the time variable (aka trend)
    -   Parameter Distributions\
        ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.13.png){.lightbox width="432"}
    -   Correlation\
        ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.14.png){.lightbox width="432"}
        -   Lower intitial values (intercepts) show the greatest growth (slopes) over time
        -   Correlation = -0.32
-   [Bivariate]{.underline}
    -   Process
        -   Filter data by Level 2 variable
        -   For each category of the Level 2 variable, fit a regression, yt = β0 + β1t + εt, for each unit/subject.
        -   Aggregate results
    -   Parameter Distributions\
        ![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.15.png){.lightbox width="432"}
