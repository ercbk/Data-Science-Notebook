Misc

* Need to figure out if
	* There's significant within-unit variation. If so, then FE model will likely be the best model
		* [Article](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/06/fixed-effects-vs-random-effects-for-web-browsing-data-a-simulation/) with simulated data showed that within variation around sd < 0.5 didn't detect the effect of explanatory variable but ymmv (depends on # of units, observations per unit, N)
	* There's significant between-unit variation. If so, then RE model will likely be the best model




Multilevel

* Is my data clustered?
* Separate variables into levels
	* Level One: variables measured at the most frequently occurring observational unit
		* i.e. variables that (for the most part) have different values for each row
		* i.e. vary for each repeated measure of a subject and vary between subjects
	* Level Two: variables measured on larger observational units
		* i.e. constant for each repeated measure of a subject but vary between each subject
* Univariate
	* Level 1 and Level 2
		* Group-level correlation or autocorrelation in variables can mislead or obscure patterns
			* If level 2 variable categories are pretty well balanced and there's sufficient data, then plotting means can remove the correlation affect in the plot
		* Continuous
			* Looking at the skew, median/mean, bimodal or not
			* Example:![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.png)
				* (Top) Each observation is plotted as if each observation is independent of the other
					* \* Ignores dependency (via repeated measures)
				* (Bottom) Means for each subject or case or other level of a random variable
					* \* Removes dependency
				* Interpretation: Right skew remains in both plots but plot 1's decrease is smoother than plot 2's
		* Categorical
			* Calculate proportions of each category and noting trends (ordinal variables) or severe imbalances
* Bivariate
	* Questions
		* Is there is a general trend suggesting that as the covariate increases the response either increases or decreases (trend)
		* Do subjects at certain levels of the covariate tend to have similar mean values of the response (low variability)
		* Is the variation in the response at different levels of the covariate (unequal variability)
	* Me: Comparison between plots that take into account dependency and the same plot that doesn't
		* Trend in plot that ignores dependency but no trend in plot that removes dependency
			* May indicate within-subject variation
		* No trend in plot that ignores dependency but trend in plot that removes dependency
			* May indicate between-subject variation
	* Boxplots (Categorical)![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.2.png)
		* Level 1 categorical covariates (y-axis) vs continuous outcome (x-axis)
		* \* Ignores dependency (via repeated measures)
		* Interpretation
			* Left: ordinal covariate, medians are close and boxes pretty much contained within each other but there might be a trend
			* Right: Looks like some decent variation between categories
		* Mean outcome (per subject) vs covariate![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.6.png)
			* \* Removes dependency
			* Interpretation: looks like some decent variation between categories
	* Scatter (Continuous)![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.3.png)
		* Level 1 continuous covariate (x-axis) vs continuous outcome (y-axis)
		* \* Ignores dependency (via repeated measures)
		* Actually a discrete  covariate being treated as continuous the fact that does seem to be a small trend is what's important
		* Mean outcome (per subject) vs covariate![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.7.png)
			* \* Removes dependency
			* Interpretation: PEM not showing much of an correlation if any
	* Facetting previous plots by subject![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.5.png)![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.4.png)
		* Left
			* Mostly downward trends but some upward trends
			* Useful for prior formulation
			* Gives an idea about the uncertainty of the slope of this variable
		* Right
			* Scarcity of points for some categories makes boxplots a bad idea
			* Difficult to spot any trends
		* \* Removes dependency
* Trivariate
	* Scatter, color by random variable![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.1.png)
		* Variables
			* "points per 60 min" (outcome)
			* "time on ice" (fixed effect)
			* facetted by "position" (fixed effect)
			* colored by "player" (potential random variable)
		* Interpretation
			* Theres does seem to be clustering by "player" therefore a mixed effects model might be a good choice.
* Null Model (aka random intercept-only model)

```
m0 <- lmer(pp60 ~ 1 + (1 | player), 
      data = df)

jtools::summ(m0)
GROUPING VARIABLES
GROUP # GROUPS ICC
player       20      0.89
```

* ICC > 0.1 is generally accepted as the minimal threshold for justifying the use of Mixed Effects model (See ICC section)



Longitudinal

* Repeated measures that have a sequential or time component
* packages: [{brolgar}]{style='color: #990000'}
* Univariate
	* numerical outcome vs. time
		* Facetted by observational unit (e.g. school)![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.10.png)![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.8.png)
			* linear fit and line chart
		* Spaghetti![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.9.png)
* Bivariate
	* **Bold** line is the overall fit with LOESS
	* numeric outcome vs time
		* facetted by categorical![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.11.png)
		* facetted by binned numeric![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.12.png)
	* Time Endpoints![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/Screenshot (a1).png)
		* "School Type" is a categorical, level 2 variable and "Math Score" is the numeric outcome
		* Looking for change from the initial measurement to the final measurement
	* Predictor vs confounder
		* 
* Linear parameters
	* Fit a linear regression _for each subject/unit_ with its repeated measurements
		* See univariate >> numerical outcome vs. time >> Facetted by observational unit >> (left) linear fit
	* Advantages
		* Each unit's/subject's data points can be summarized with two summary statistics—an intercept and a slope
			* Bigger advantage when there are more observations over time per unit/subject
		* Seems like a good way for using empirical bayes (i.e. use these distributions for prior specifications)
	* Disadvantages
		* Slopes cannot be estimated for those units/subjects with just a single observation
		* R-squared values cannot be calculated for those units/subjects with no variability in test scores during the time period
		* R-squared values must be 1 for those units/subjects with only two test scores.
	* Summary statistics
		* mean and sd for intercepts and slopes
	* Univariate
		* yt \= β0 \+ β1t + εt
			* t is the time variable (aka trend)
		* Parameter Distributions![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.13.png)
		* Correlation![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.14.png)
			* Lower intitial values (intercepts) show the greatest growth (slopes) over time
			* Correlation = -0.32
	* Bivariate
		* Process
			* Filter data by Level 2 variable
			* For each category of the Level 2 variable, fit a regression, yt \= β0 \+ β1t + εt, for each unit/subject.
			* Aggregate results
		* Parameter Distributions![](./_resources/EDA,_Multilevel,_Longitudinal.resources/image.15.png)
			* "School Type" is a Level 2, binary variable
