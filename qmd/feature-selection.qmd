# Feature Selection {#sec-featsel .unnumbered}

## Misc {#sec-featsel-misc .unnumbered}

-   Why?
    -   Reduces chances of overfitting
    -   Multicollinearity among predictors blows up std.errors in regression
    -   Lowers computer resources requirements and increase speed

An extended Bayesian information criterion is also implemented for variable selection
-   Never use stepwise (backwards, forwards, etc.) for selecting variables according to statistical significance (e.g. p-value, or reduce the Akaike Information Criterion, or increase adjusted R-squared, or in fact any other data-driven statistics) for prediction or inferential models.

    -   Some real explanatory variables that have causal effects on the dependent variable may happen to not be statistically significant, while nuisance variables may be coincidentally significant. As a result, the model may fit the data well in-sample, but do poorly out-of-sample.
    -   Stepwise regression is less effective the larger the number of potential explanatory variables.
    -   False positives go up and estimates are biased away from zero
    -   From Harrell's RMS
        -   The R-squared or even adjusted R-squared values of the end model are biased high.
        -   The F and Chi-square test statistics of the final model do not have the claimed distribution.
        -   The standard errors of coefficient estimates are biased low and confidence intervals for effects and predictions are falsely narrow.
        -   The p values are too small (there are severe multiple comparison problems in addition to problems 2. and 3.) and do not have the proper meaning, and it is difficult to correct for this.
        -   The regression coefficients are biased high in absolute value and need shrinkage but this is rarely done.
        -   Variable selection is made arbitrary by collinearity.
        -   It allows us to not think about the problem.

    -   BMA estimates models for all possible combinations of your explanatory variables and constructs a weighted average over all of them.
        -   Quantities of interest (model parameters or prediction probabilities, for instance) are computed as the mean of the estimates from several candidate models weighted by the posterior probability of each model given the data.
    -   If your set of explanatory variables has size K, then this means estimating 2^K^ variable combinations and thus 2^K^ models.
    -   The model weights for this averaging stem from posterior model probabilities that arise from Bayes’ theorem
        -   Various approximations, such as the WAIC can be used to compute the posterior probability of each model.
        -   In the frequentist approach, the weights can be proportional to Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) or achieved by minimization of the mean squared error

    -   Uses gain penalization to regularize the random forest algorithm

    -   Think this also works for numeric target variables

    -   Notes from

        -   [Feature Selection via Gain Penalization in Random Forests](https://brunaw.com/blog/posts/2021-03-30-rf-penalization/)
            -   Includes coded example
        -   [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07515.pdf)

    -   When determining the next child node to be added to a decision tree, the gain (or the error reduction) of each feature is multiplied by a penalization parameter\
        $$
        \mbox{Gain}_R(\boldsymbol{X}_i, t) = 
        \left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
        \lambda \Delta(i, t) & i \notin \mathbb{U} \\
        \Delta(i,t) & i\in \mathbb{U}
        \end{array}\right.
        $$

        -   $U$ is the set of indices of the features previously used in the tree
        -   $X_i$ is the candidate feature
        -   $t$ is the candidate splitting point
        -   $\lambda$ is the penalty for each variable, $\lambda \in (0,1]$ (See below)
        -   So at each split point, variables that have NOT been chosen at prior split points receive a penalty

    -   Penalty for each variable (the λ shown in the Gain equation above)

        $$
        \lambda = (1-\gamma)\cdot\lambda_0 + \gamma \cdot g(x_i)
        $$

        -   $\lambda_i \in [0,1)$
        -   $\lambda_0 \in [0,1)$ is interpreted as the baseline regularization
        -   $\gamma \in [0,1)$ is the mixture parameter
        -   $g(x_i)$ is a function of the i^th^ feature
            -   Should represent relevant information about the feature, based on some characteristic of interest (correlation to the target, for example)
            -   Introduces "prior knowledge" regarding the importance of each feature into the model
            -   The data will tell us how strong our assumptions about the penalization are, since even if we try to penalize a truly important feature, its gain will be high enough to overcome the penalization and the feature will get selected by the algorithm
            -   Examples
                -   The Mutual Information between each feature and the target variable $y$
                    -   Normalized to be between 0 and 1
                -   The variable importance values obtained from a previously run standard Random Forest, which is what I call a Boosted g(xi)
                    -   Normalized to be between 0 and 1
                -   Other options, see the paper

    -   Steps

        1.  We run a bunch of penalized random forests models with different hyperparameters and record their accuracies and final set of features
            -   $\gamma$, $\lambda_0$ and [mtry]{.arg-text} are hyperparameters that should be tuned
        2.  For each training dataset, select the top-n (e.g. n = 3) fitted models in terms of the accuracies, and run a "new" random forest for each of the feature sets used by them. This is done using all of the training sets so we can evaluate how these features perform in slightly different scenarios
        3.  Finally, get the top-m set of models (here m = 30) from these new ones, check which features were the most used between them and run a final random forest model with this feature set.
            -   e.g. Select only the 15 most used features from the top 30 models, but both numbers can be changed depending on the situation

## Multidimensional Feature Selection (MDFS) {#sec-featsel-mdfs .unnumbered}

-   [Misc]{.underline}

    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[mdfs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MDFS/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} and [{{]{style="color: goldenrod"}[mdfs](https://pypi.org/project/mdfs/){style="color: goldenrod"}[}}]{style="color: goldenrod"} - [Vignette](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019/RJ-2019-019/RJ-2019-019.pdf), [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020025520302048?via%3Dihub)

        -   There's a mention of CUDA, so this could be GPU-capable

-   [Description]{.underline}

    -   Compares tuples of variables using entropy/information gain (see below for details on the algorithm)

    -   A filter method which means it identifies informative variables before modelling is performed.

        -   In general, filter methods are usually simplistic and therefore fast, but simplicity can sometimes lead to errors

    -   As of 2019-10-13, implementation only for use with binary outcomes

        -   For multi-categorical outcomes, vignette suggests either performing the analyses with all pairs of outcome categories, then any variable deemed relevant for one analysis is considered relevant. Instead of doing all-pairs, you can dichotomize variable into pairs of category-other which would be less expensive
        -   Continuous outcomes have to be discretized

    -   The algorithm explores all k-tuples of variables for k-dimensional analysis

        $$
        x \cup \{x_{m_1}, x_{m_2}, \ldots, x_{m_{k-1}}\}
        $$

        -   $x_i$ is one of the explanatory variables
        -   The max k is 5
            -   If it's GPU-capable, this may not be the case anymore
            -   For larger values than 5, it becomes computationally expensive and detecting significant differences in conditional entropy becomes less likely.
            -   For example, 2-dimensional analysis would explore the set of all possible pairs (2-tuples) of variables.
                -   For each variable, $x_i$, check whether adding it to the set with another variable, $x_j$, adds information to the system.
                -   If there exists such a $x_j$, then we declare $x_i$ as 2-weakly relevant.

-   [Steps]{.underline}

    1.  Discretize all variables
        -   Choose the number of classes, $c$
            -   All variables are coerced into having the same number of classes (even binary? So if you have one binary, then all variables are coerced into binaries?)
            -   Unless there's domain knowledge, multiple $c$ values should be tried.
        -   Randomly sample ($c-1$) integers from a uniform distribution on the interval, ($2, N$) where $N$ is the number of observations.
            -   The integers will be indexes where the variable is split into c classes
            -   At first glance it looks like the interval starts at 2 so that each class has minimum of 2 or 3 values (depending if the split happens before or after the integer), but unless there's some kind of check, two consecutive integers, like 19,20, could still be sampled and then you have a problem. With a large data set, it seems unlikely to happen, but it'd still be possible. So I don't know why it starts at 2. The vignette isn't clear about this IMO.
        -   Sort the variable
            -   I guess smallest value to largest? Probably doesn't matter as long as it's consistent for all variables)
        -   Split the sorted variable at the indexes given by the randomly sampled integers
        -   Repeat for each variable
            -   The outcome variable might have to be done manually by the user prior to starting analysis/
    2.  Compute conditional entropy for Y given the k-dimension variable set that includes a specific variable and the conditional entropy for the ($k-1$) set that excludes that specific variable.
        -   **Conditional Entropy** for $Y | X_1, \ldots, X_k$ is

            $$
            H(Y|X_1, \ldots, X_k) = \sum_{d=0} \sum_{i_1 = 1}^c \ldots \sum_{i_k = 1}^c P(y_d | x_{i_1}, \ldots, x_{i_k}) \; \log P(y_d |x_{i_1}, \ldots, x_{i_k})
            $$

            -   $d$ is for the outcome variable category which much be binary
            -   $i_1$ is the ith category of the 1^st^ variable
            -   $i_k$ is the ith category of the k^th^ variable
            -   This sequence of summations amounts to taking every permutation of outcome category and every category of every explanatory variable and summing them together.

            -   The conditional entropy for the ($k-1$) set of explanatory variable is calculated similarily

        -   If $k$ is less than total number of variables, then this process could include many permutations
    3.  Compute the mutual information gain between these two entropies. Then out of all the mutual information values from all the different permutations of the $k$-tuple, choose the maximum value
        -   Mutual information is the difference between two conditional entropies. Very similar to the information gain used in trees

            $$
            IG_{\max}^k = N \; \max \{H(Y|X_1, \ldots, X_k) - H(Y|X_1, \ldots, X_{k-1})\}
            $$

            -   $m$ is m^th^ permutation of the $k$-tuple
            -   $N$ is the number of observations. The reason for it being there is that multiplying the $IG_{\max}$ by $N$ makes it a distribution parameter that can be hypothesis tested.
    4.  Hypothesis test this difference ($IG_{\max}$) to see if it's significant
        -   If the difference is significant, then that variable is *k-weakly relevant*
        -   Test statistic for a specific $\alpha$-level is from an empirically calculated distribution
        -   Adjust p-values to control FWER or FDR
    5.  If performing a more complicated model selection process, take the top n variables whose $IG_{\max}$ was significant and repeat steps
        -   Guessing this is backwards elimination
        -   This is a method that's built for dealing with thousands of variables, so this taking top-n-then-repeat seems to be a way of controlling the amount of time needed to complete the analysis.
