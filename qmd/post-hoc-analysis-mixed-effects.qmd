    -   Interpretation
        -   There is NOT a difference between the effect that Postseason has on Distance and the effect that Inseason has on Distance.
        -   There is a difference with between the other two pairs of categores
        -   Estimated mean distance given season type
            -   I'm not sure these estimates are appropriate in this situation since the Season variable is inherently unbalanced.

## Cohen's D {#sec-phoc-mixeff-cohensd .unnumbered}

-   Standardized difference in means given a grouping variable

-   [Recommended to use $g_{\text{rm}}$ or $g_{\text{av}}$]{.underline}

    -   Standard practice is use whichever one is closer to $d_s$ , because it helps make the result comparable with between-subject studies.

-   Notes from: [Calculating and reporting effect sizes to facilitate cumulative science: a practical primer for t-tests and ANOVAs](https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/3835042/1236489301722996.pdf) (Lakens)

-   Can be used to compare effects across studies, even when the dependent variables are measured in different ways

    -   [Examples]{.ribbon-highlight}

        -   When one study uses 7-point scales to measure dependent variables, while the other study uses 9-point scales

        -   When completely different measures are used, such as when one study uses self-report measures, and another study used physiological measurements.

-   The bias-corrected version is known as **Hedges' g**, and in the r family of effect sizes, the correction for eta squared (η2) is known as omega squared (ω2)

-   Guidelines

    -   Range: 0 to $\infty$

    -   Cohen (1992)

        -   \|d\| \< 0.2 "negligible"
        -   \|d\| \< 0.5 "small"
        -   \|d\| \< 0.8 "medium"
        -   otherwise "large"

    -   Others: [Automated Interpretation of Indices of Effect Size](https://easystats.github.io/effectsize/articles/interpret.html)

    -   Values should not be interpreted rigidly

        -   e.g. Small effect sizes can have large consequences, such as an intervention that leads to a reliable reduction in suicide rates with an effect size of d = 0.1.

    -   The only reason to use these benchmarks is when the findings are extremely novel, and cannot be compared to related findings in the literature.

-   [Two groups of Independent Observations (Between-Subjects)]{.underline}

    $$
    \begin{align}
    d_s &= \frac{\bar X_1 - \bar X_2}{\sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)SD^2_1 + (n_2-1)SD^2_2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}}\\
    &= t\;\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}\\
    & \approx \frac{2t}{\sqrt{N}}
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   Where the denominator is the pooled standard deviation

    -   $t$ is the t-value of two-sample t-test

    -   Typically used in an a priori power analysis for between-subjects designs

    -   **Hedges' g** (bias-corrected)

        $$
        g_s = d_s \times \left(1-\frac{3}{4(n_1 + n_2) - 9}\right)
        $$

        -   The difference between Hedges's g~s~ and Cohen's d~s~ is very small, especially in sample sizes above 20

    -   Interpretation: A percentage of the standard deviation. Best to relate it to other effect sizes in the literature and it's practical consequences if possible.

        -   e.g. $d_s = 0.5$ says the difference in means is half a standard deviation.

    -   Whenever standard deviations differ substantially between groups, Glass's $\Delta$ should also be reported

-   [One Sample or Correlated Samples (Within-Subjects)]{.underline}

    $$
    \begin{align}
    d_z &= \frac{M_{\text{diff}}}{\sqrt{\frac{\sum(X_{\text{diff}} - M_{\text{diff}})^2}{N-1}}}\\
    &= \frac{t}{\sqrt{n}}
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   $M_{\text{diff}}$ is the difference between the mean (M) of the difference scores and the comparison value, $\mu$ (e.g. 0)

    -   $X_{\text{diff}}$ are the difference scores (i.e. the difference between the repeated measurements)

    -   Therefore, the demominator is the SD of the difference scores

    -   $t$ is the t-value of a paired samples t-test

-   [Repeated Measures (Within-Subjects)]{.underline}

    $$
    d_{\text{rm}} = \frac{M_{\text{diff}}\cdot \sqrt{2(1-r)}}{\sqrt{\text{SD}_1^2 + \text{SD}_2^2 - (2\cdot r\cdot \text{SD}_1 \cdot \text{SD}_2)}}
    $$

    -   $r$ is the correlation between measurements

    -   Alternative

        $$
        d_{\text{av}} = \frac{M_{\text{diff}}}{\frac{\text{SD}_1 + \text{SD}_2}{2}}
        $$

        -   Ignores the correlation between measures

    -   If it is believe that the intervention/treatment affected the SD after the intervention, then it is advised to only use either (pre-treatment) $\text{SD}_1$ (recommended) or (post-treatment) $\text{SD}_2$ and report which one is used. The calculated effect is then known as **Glass's** $\boldsymbol{\Delta}$

    Another package, [{effectsize}]{style="color: #990000"}, is similar in that its formula arg only allows for grouping variables with only 2 levels

## Common Language Effect Size

$$
Z = \frac{|X_1 - X_2|}{\sqrt{\frac{\text{SD}_1^2 +\text{SD}_2^2}{2}}}
$$

-   The CL effect size e is the percentage associated with the upper tail probability of this Z-Score
-   AKA Probability of Superiority
-   Converts the effect size into a percentage
-   Interpretation
    -   Between-Subjects: The probability that a randomly sampled person from one group will have a higher observed measurement than a randomly sampled person from the other group
    -   Within-Subjects: The probability that an individual has a higher value on one measurement than the other.
