-   Definition
    -   Asking the right question
    -   "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts to LLMs for a wide variety of applications and research topics. Prompts are short pieces of text that are used to guide the LM's output. They can be used to specify the task that the LM is supposed to accomplish, provide additional information that the LM needs to complete the task, or simply make the task easier for the LM to understand."
-   Components
    -   Ask the question (e.g. "What's 1+1?")
    -   Specify the type of response you want. (e.g. Only return the numeric answer.)
        -   persona
            -   "Explain this to my like I'm a fifth grader."
        -   style
            -   "Use a style typical of scientific abstracts to write this."
-   LLMs don't understand the complexities or nuances of various subjects
    -   If an industry term is used in multiple ways, the LLM might not understand the meaning just by context alone.
    -   LLMs can have problems with information in complex formats.
        -   Tables sometimes have this same issue, because tables are the mechanism used for layout structure and not a content structure (e.g. sentence)
    -   The models themselves continue to evolve so if it doesn't understand something today doesn't mean that it won't understand it tomorrow
-   When the output is incomplete, type "continue" for the next prompt and it will finish the output.
-   **Don't give LLMs proprietary data**
    -   Alternative: `slice(0)`

        ```r         
        dat |>
          slice(0) |>
          glimpse()
        ```

        -   Gives the column names and classes
        -   Depending on the use case, you might want to make the column names unabbreviated and meaningful.

-   Tips when used for writing

    -   Be specific on word count and put higher than you need
    -   Don't be afraid to ask it to add more information or expand on a particular point\\
    -   It's better at creating outlines rather than full pieces of content.
    -   Be as specific as possible, and use keywords to help ChatGPT understand what you are looking for
    -   You can ask it to rephrase its response
    -   Avoid using complex language or convoluted sentence structures
    -   \*\*Review the content for accuracy

    -   Show the prompt he used in a markdown file. He just copied and pasted it into the prompt.
    -   Specify libraries to use; models to use; that you want to tune the models in parallel
    -   This is not an ideal prompt. You should iterate prompts and guide gpt through complete ds process
        -   i.e. prompt for collection then a prompt for cleaning, and so on with eda, preprocessing, modelling, cv, model selection, app
