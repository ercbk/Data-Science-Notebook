-   AKA Random Utility or Choice Models

-   Goal: Model the category probabilities for a polytomous (i.e. \# of categoies \> 2) response

    -   Let $\phi_{ij} \equiv \phi_j(\vec{x_i})$ be the probability of response category j for unit i given predictor $\vec{x_i}$ .

    -   Since the sum of the probabilities of all the categories equals 1, if you know m-1 probabilities for m categories, then you know the probability for the last category, $\phi_{im}$.

        $$
        \phi_{im} = 1 - \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \phi_{ij}
        $$

    -   The essential idea is to construct a model for the polytomous response composed of m−1 logit comparisons among the response categories in a manner analogous to the treatment of factors in the predictor variables (i.e. creating dummy variables for the m-1 categories).

The main extensions of the basic multinomial model (heteroscedastic, nested and random parameter models) are implemented.

        -   Nested dichotomies are statistically independent, and hence provide an additive decomposition of tests for the overall polytomous response. When the dichotomies make sense substantively, this method can be a simpler alternative to the standard multinomial logistic model which compares response categories to a reference level.

        -   Offers speedups of 10 - 50 times for modestly sized problems and more than 100 times for larger problems. Running in parallel mode on a multicore machine gives up to 4 times additional speedup on 8 processor cores. mnlogit achieves its computational efficiency by drastically speeding up computation of the log-likelihood function's Hessian matrix through exploiting structure in matrices that arise in intermediate calculations.

## Terms {#sec-reg-multin-terms .unnumbered}

-   [**Random Utility**]{style="color: #009499"} - models rely on the hypothesis that the decision maker is able to rank the different alternatives by an order of preference represented by a utility function, the chosen alternative being the one which is associated with the highest level of utility. They are called random utility models because part of the utility is unobserved and is modeled as the realization of a random deviate. (See [Decision Intelligence](decision-intelligence.qmd){style="color: green"})

## Multinomial Logit (MNL) {#sec-reg-multin-mnl .unnumbered}

-   AKA Generalized Logit
-   When the polytomous response has m levels, the multinomial logit model comprises m−1 log-odds comparisons with a reference level, typically the first or last.
    -   The likelihood under the model and the fitted response probabilities that it produces are unaffected by choice of reference level, much as choice of reference level for dummy regressors created from a factor predictor doesn't affect the fit of a regression model.
-   Assumes identical and independent errors following a Gumbel distribution

## Nested Logit {#sec-reg-multin-nestlog .unnumbered}

-   Fits separate models for each of a hierarchically nested set of binary comparisons among the response categories. The set of m−1 models comprises a complete model for the polytomous response, just as the multinomial logit model does.

-   Assumes Gumbel distribution of errors but relax the i.i.d. hypothesis

-   Both MNL and Nested Logit methods have have p×(m−1) parameters. The models are not equivalent, however, in that they generally produce different sets of fitted category probabilities and hence different likelihoods.

    -   Multinomial logit model treats the response categories symmetrically

-   By the construction of nested dichotomies, the submodels are statistically independent (because the likelihood for the polytomous response is the product of the likelihoods for the dichotomies), so test statistics, such as likelihood ratio (G^2^) and Wald chi-square tests for regression coefficients can be summed to give overall tests for the full polytomy.

-   Nested dichotomies are not unique and alternative sets of nested dichotomies are not equivalent: Different choices have different interpretations. Moreover, and more fundamentally, fitted probabilities and hence the likelihood for the nested-dichotomies model depend on how the nested dichotomies are defined.

-   Example: 2 methods of splitting a 4-level response into dichotomies\
    ![](_resources/Regression-Multinomial.resources/nested-dichot1.jpg){width="473"}

    -   Left: Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} → {1,2} vs {3,4} → {1} vs {2} and {3} vs {4}

    -   Right: (Continuous Logit) Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} → {1} vs {2, 3, 4} → {2} vs {3, 4} → {3} vs {4}

        -   {1} vs. {2,3,4} could represent highschool graduation

        -   {2} vs. {3,4} could represesnt enrollment in post-secondary education

        -   {3} vs. {4} could represent completion of a post-secondary degree.

    -   Data:

        -   "partic": labor force participation, the response, with levels:

            -   "fulltime": working full-time

            -   "not.work": not working outside the home

            -   "parttime" : working part-time.

        -   "hincome": Husband's income, in \$1,000s.

        -   "children": Presence of children in the home, `"absent"` or `"present"`.

    -   Set-up sets of dichotomies that you want analyze

        ``` r
        set1 <- 
          logits(work = dichotomy("not.work", 
                                  working = c("parttime", "fulltime")),
                 full = dichotomy("parttime", "fulltime"))

        set2 <-
          logits(full = dichotomy(nonfulltime = c("not.work", "parttime"),
                                  "fulltime"),
                 part = dichotomy("not.work", "parttime"))
        ```

        -   set1:
            -   "work": Women who are NOT working outside the home vs. those who are working (either part-time or full-time).
            -   "full": Women who work full-time time vs. part-time, but among only those who work.
        -   set2:
            -   "full": {full-time} vs. {not working, part-time}
                -   The rationale is that the real hurdle for young married women to enter the paid labor force is to combine full-time work outside the home with housework.
            -   "part": {not working} vs. {part-time}.

    -   Fit 1st Set

        ``` r
        wlf.nested.one <- 
            nestedLogit(partic ~ hincome + children,
                        dichotomies = set1,
                        data = Womenlf)

        # show as odds ratios
        exp(coef(wlf.nested))
        #>                   work     full
        #> (Intercept)     3.8032 32.38753
        #> hincome         0.9586  0.89829
        #> childrenpresent 0.2069  0.07055
        ```

        -   Fits 2 glm models

            -   `glm(formula = work ~ hincome + children, family = binomial, data = Womenlf, contrasts = contrasts)`

            -   `glm(formula = full ~ hincome + children, family = binomial, data = Womenlf, contrasts = contrasts)`

        -   A combined model is also produced using the Delta Method

        -   Estimates are calculated for all models and predicted probabilities for the category levels are from the combined model.

    -   Results

        ``` r
        # show as odds ratios
        exp(coef(wlf.nested))
        #>                   work     full
        #> (Intercept)     3.8032 32.38753
        #> hincome         0.9586  0.89829
        #> childrenpresent 0.2069  0.07055
        ```

        -   $\hat{\beta}_{\text{work, hincome}}$ gives the estimated change in the log-odds of working vs. not working associated with a \$1,000 increase in husband's income and with having children present, each holding the other constant.
        -   $\hat{\beta}_{\text{full, hincome}}$ same as above, but gives the estimated change the log-odds of working full-time vs. part-time among those who are working outside the home.
        -   Interpretation (after exponentiation): The odds of both working and working full-time decrease with husband's income, by about 4% and 10% respectively per \$1000. Having young children also decreases the odds of both working and working full-time, by about 79% and 93% respectively.

    -   Fit 2nd Set

        ``` r
        wlf.nested.two <- 
          nestedLogit(partic ~ hincome + children,
                      dictotomies = set2,
                      data=Womenlf)
        ```

    -   Results

        ``` r
        summary(wlf.nested.two)

        ```

        -   `summary` also shows all the typical model summary info, but only for each dichotomy and not the combined model.
        -   `Anova` will perform Chi-Square tests on each explanatory variable in each dichotomy and the combined model.
        -   The predictors husband's income and presence of children affect the decision to work full-time, but not the decision to work part-time among those who aren't engaged in full-time work. (See "Set-up sets of dichotomies" section describing this set's rationale)
