-   AKA Random Utility or Choice Models
-   Goal: Model the category probabilities for a polytomous (i.e. \# of categoies \> 2) response
    -   Let $\phi_{ij} \equiv \phi_j(\vec{x_i})$ be the probability of response category j for unit i given predictor $\vec{x_i}$ .

    -   Since the sum of the probabilities of all the categories equals 1, if you know m-1 probabilities for m categories, then you know the probability for the last category, $\phi_{im}$.

        $$
        \phi_{im} = 1 - \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \phi_{ij}
        $$

    -   The essential idea is to construct a model for the polytomous response composed of m−1 logit comparisons among the response categories in a manner analogous to the treatment of factors in the predictor variables (i.e. creating dummy variables for the m-1 categories).

-   [**Alternative**]{style="color: #009499"} - The levels of a polytomous response in Random Utility Models. (Also see [Decision Intelligence \>\> Random Utility Models](decison-intelligence.qmd#sec-decint-randutmod){style="color: green"})
-   [**Choice Probability**]{style="color: #009499"} - The probability that a decision-maker will chose a particular alternative. The predicted response for a Random Utility Model. (Also see [Decision Intelligence \>\> Random Utility Models](decison-intelligence.qmd#sec-decint-randutmod){style="color: green"})
-   [**Market Share**]{style="color: #009499"} - The percentage of total sales in an industry or product category that belong to a particular company during a discrete period of time. For a Random Utility Model, when the data is at the market level instead of the individual level, the predicted response is the Market Share. (Also see [Decision Intelligence \>\> Random Utility Models](decison-intelligence.qmd#sec-decint-randutmod){style="color: green"})
-   [**Random Utility Models**]{style="color: #009499"} - These models rely on the hypothesis that the decision maker is able to rank the different alternatives by an order of preference represented by a utility function, the chosen alternative being the one which is associated with the highest level of utility. They are called random utility models because part of the utility is unobserved and is modeled as the realization of a random deviate. (Also see [Decision Intelligence](decison-intelligence.qmd){style="color: green"} \>\> Terms, Random Utility Models)
-   Data sets used to estimate random utility models have therefore a specific structure that can be characterized by three indexes: the alternative, the choice situation, and the individual. The distinction between choice situation and individual indexes is only relevant if we have repeated observations for the same individual.
    -   Examples of variable types

        -   Choice Situation Specific
            -   data1: Length of the vacation and the Season
            -   data2: values of dist, income and urban are repeated four times.
                -   dist (the distance of the trip)

                -   income (household income),

                -   urban (a dummy for trips which have a large city at

                    the origin or the destination)

                -   noalt the number of available alternatives
        -   Individual Specific
            -   data1: Income and Family Size
            -   data2: None
        -   Alternative Specific
            -   data1: Distance to Destination and Cost
            -   data2:
                -   transport modes (air, train, bus and car)
                -   cost for monetary cost
                -   ivt for in vehicle time
                -   ovt for out of vehicle time
                -   freq for frequency

    -   The unit of observation is therefore the choice situation, and it is also the individual if thereis only one choice situation per individual observed, which is often the case

    -   Data Descriptions

        -   Each individual has responded to several (up to 16) scenarios.
        -   For every scenario, two train tickets A and B are proposed to the user, with different combinations of four attributes: price (the price in cents of guilders), time (travel time in minutes), change (the number of changes) and comfort (the class of comfort, 0, 1 or 2, 0 being the most comfortable class).

    -   Dataset in wide format

        ``` r
        #>    id choiceid choice price_A time_A change_A comfort_A price_B time_B
        #> 1  1  1        A      2400    150    0        1         4000    150
        #> 2  1  2        A      2400    150    0        1         3200    130
        #> 3  1  3        A      2400    115    0        1         4000    115

        #>    change_B comfort_B
        #> 1  0        1
        #> 2  0        1
        #> 3  0        0
        ```

    -   Transform to long format and add index attribute with {dfidx}

        ``` r
        Tr <- 
          dfidx(Train, 
                shape = "wide", 
                choice = "choice",
                varying = 4:11, 
                sep = "_", 
                idx = list(c("choiceid", "id")),
                idnames = c("chid", "alt"),

        ```

        -   In "long" format (default) is a data.frame with a special column which containsthe corresponding indexes. A lot of these argument values are passed to `reshape` to produce the final format.

        -   "varying" - Indicates alternative specific variables which is a numeric vector that indicates their position in the data frame.

        -   "sep" - In wide format, variable names are of the form, `<var>_choice` (default ".").

        -   "choice" - Indicates the response that has to be transformed in a logical value

        -   "idx" - Adds attribute which specifies the nesting structure of the id variables

            -   Each individual faces different choice situations, the "id" variable, which contains the individual index, nests the choice situation variable called "choiceid."

            -   Contains the three relevant indexes: choiceid is the choice situation index, alt the alternative index and id is the individual index.

        -   "opposite" - If you expect negative coefficients, taking the opposite of the covariates will lead to expected positive coefficients. (?)

    -   Add idx attribute to an already long formatted df

        ``` r
        MC <- 
          MC <- dfidx(ModeCanada, 
                      subset = noalt == 4,
                      idx = c("case", "alt"))
        ```

        -   Order of variables doesn't seem to matter for the "idx" arg in order to specify index types

        -   The primary dplyr verbs can be applied to dfidx objects

## Multinomial Logit (MNL) {#sec-reg-multin-mnl .unnumbered}

-   AKA Generalized Logit

-   When the polytomous response has m levels (aka Alternatives), the multinomial logit model comprises m−1 log-odds comparisons with a reference level, typically the first or last.

    -   The likelihood under the model and the fitted response probabilities that it produces are unaffected by choice of reference level, much as choice of reference level for dummy regressors created from a factor predictor doesn't affect the fit of a regression model.

-   Choice Probability for alternative, i, and decision-maker, n:

    $$
    P_{ni} = \frac {e^{V_{ni}}}{\sum_j e^{V_{nj}}} = \frac {e^{\hat{\beta}x_{ni}}}{\sum_j e^{{\hat{\beta}x_{nj}}}}
    $$

    -   The probability that decision-maker, $n$, chooses alternative, $i$

    -   Predicted probability output from the model

-   Assumptions

    -   Exogenity of the alternative attribute variables of the alternatives: $\mathbb{E}[\epsilon \; | \; \vec {x}] = 0$ (i.e mean of the residuals is 0)
        -   Example of Endogenity
            -   Taking a car to work or taking the bus to work are the alternatives.
            -   If a commuter likes to drive, they won't care about living close to a bus stop
            -   If a commuter likes to take the bus, they are more likely to live close to a bus stop
            -   Therefore your logit model will be biased because any attribute variable that is related to the distance a decision-maker is from a bus stop will be endogenous.
                -   e.g. Time each mode of transportation takes to get to work will be endogenous because distance from the bus stop affects time and distance to bus stop is correlated with a decision maker already biased towards buses and not with a decision maker who would choose bus or car.
                    -   i.e. distance isn't randomly distributed among all decision makers.
        -   Solution: TBD in a later lecture
    -   iid residuals following a Gumbel distribution
        -   Residuals are the unobserved utility (i.e. random utility).
        -   For panel data, it's unlikely that each unobserved alternative attribute for a decision maker is independent across a time component which makes this a bad model for such data.
            -   e.g. If a person chooses Count Chocula one day and Fruit Loops the next, it's unlikely that the unobserved components of utility that led to the Count Chocula choice aren't correlated with the unobserved components of utility that led to the Fruit Loops choice.

-   Substitution Patterns

    -   Independence of Irrelavent Alternatives (IIA) Property of Logit models
        -   Example: car, blue bus , red bus
            -   In the beginning, the decision maker only has 2 choices: drive car or ride blue bus.
            -   The probability of choosing the alternative car is the same for a decision maker as choosing the alternative blue bus: $P_c = P_{bb} = 1/2$
            -   Then a red bus is added to the choices, but the decision maker doesn't care whether the bus is red or blue. Therefore the blue bus and the red bus have the same choice probability: $P_{bb} = P_{rb}$
            -   But from the IIA property, the ratio of choice probability between car and blue bus is not changed after introduction of the red bus. Therefore, $P_c = P_{bb} = P_{rb} = 1/3$
            -   In reality, the choice probability for car has NOT decreased, since for decision maker, the choice is actually between car and bus --- color isn't a relative factor
        -   Example: Hummer, Escalade, Prius
            -   Hummer lowers price.
            -   Will Hummer attract more Escalade drivers than Prius?
            -   The logit model says that "proportional substitution to the Hummer will be equal for the Escalade and the Prius.
                -   i.e. The lowering of the Hummer price will have an equal effect on Escalade sales and Prius sales which is unrealistic
    -   Proportional Substitution
        -   Note the logit cross-elasticity equation for alternative, i, given a change in alternative, j (See below, Elasticity \>\> Cross Elasticity). The change in choice probability for alternative i only depends on the change to the attribute for alternative, j.
        -   This means that we can *substitute* any alternative for i (other than j) and the cross-elasticity will be the same and therefore the change in choice probability will be the same.
            -   i.e. We change the value of an attribute for alternative j. Then, all choice proabilities for the other alternatives (other than j) change by the **same** proportion. Doesn't matter if alternative j is correlated more strongly with another alternative or not.
        -   Shows a lack of flexibility in the logit model --- there is no structure to model the correlation between alternatives. (See Mixed Logit)

-   Marginal Effects

    -   The change in the probability of choosing alternative, i, after a change in the attribute of alternative, i.
    -   $\text{ME} = \frac {\partial P_{ni}} {\partial z_{ni}} = \beta_z P_{ni}(1-P_{ni})$
    -   $P_{ni}$ is the probability of decision maker, n, choosing alternative i.
    -   Cross Marginal Effect
        -   The change in the probability of choosing alternative, $i$, after a change in the attribute of alternative, $j$.

        -   $\text{CME} = \frac {\partial P_{ni}} {\partial z_{nj}} = -\beta_z P_{ni}P_{nj}$

-   Elasticity

    -   Marginal Effects and Elasticities are similar except elasticities are percent change.
        -   e.g. a percentage change in a regressor results in this much of a percentage change in the response level probability
    -   $E_{iz_{ni}} = \beta_z z_{ni} (1-P_{ni})$
        -   $E_{iz_{ni}}$ is the elasticity of the probability of alternative, i, with respect to $z_{ni}$, an observed attribute of alternative, i

        -   $P_{ni}$ is the predicted probability of alternative, i, for decision maker, n.
    -   Cross Elasticity
        -   $E_{iz_{ni}} = -\beta_z z_{nj} P_{nj}$

## Nested Logit {#sec-reg-multin-nestlog .unnumbered}

-   Fits separate models for each of a hierarchically nested set of binary comparisons among the response categories. The set of m−1 models comprises a complete model for the polytomous response, just as the multinomial logit model does.

-   Misc

    -   IIA still holds for two alternatives in the same dichotomy, but doesn't hold for alternatives of different different dichotomies
    -   Both MNL and Nested Logit methods have have p×(m−1) parameters. The models are not equivalent, however, in that they generally produce different sets of fitted category probabilities and hence different likelihoods.
        -   Multinomial logit model treats the response categories symmetrically
    -   Extensions
        -   [Paired Combinatorial Logit]{.underline}

            -   Allows alternatives to be in multiple dichotomies and multiple hierarchies and for them to have more complex correlation structures
                -   In nested logits, only alternatives within the same hierarchy are modeled as being correlated with each other.
            -   Creates pairwise dichotomies for each combination of alternatives (i.e. each alternative appears in J-1 nests)
            -   Best for data with fewer alternatives since the parameter space can explode fairly quickly

        -   [Generalized Nested Logit]{.underline}

            -   Allow alternatives to be in any dichotomy in any hierarchy, but assign a weight to each alternative in each dichotomy.
            -   Estimate Parameters: $\lambda_k$ (See Choice Probability below), $\alpha_{jk}$ : "weight" or proportion of alternative, $j$, in dichotomy, $k$
            -   Need to be careful about how many dichotomies that you place each alternative, since the parameter space can explode fairly quickly

        -   [Heteroskedastic Logit]{.underline}

            -   Heteroskedacity in this sense means that the variance of the unobserved utility (aka residuals) can be different for each alternative

                $$
                \mbox{Var}(\epsilon_{nj}) = \frac {(\theta_j \pi)^2}{6}
                $$

            -   Since there's no closed form solution, simulation methods must be usded to get the choice probabilities and model parameters.

-   Construction of Dichotomies

    -   By the construction of nested dichotomies, the submodels are statistically independent (because the likelihood for the polytomous response is the product of the likelihoods for the dichotomies), so test statistics, such as likelihood ratio (G^2^) and Wald chi-square tests for regression coefficients can be summed to give overall tests for the full polytomy.
    -   Nested dichotomies are not unique and alternative sets of nested dichotomies are not equivalent: Different choices have different interpretations. Moreover, and more fundamentally, fitted probabilities and hence the likelihood for the nested-dichotomies model depend on how the nested dichotomies are defined.
    -   Example: 2 methods of splitting a 4-level response into dichotomies\
        ![](_resources/Regression-Multinomial.resources/nested-dichot1.jpg){width="473"}
        -   Left: Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} → {1,2} vs {3,4} → {1} vs {2} and {3} vs {4}

        -   Right: (Continuous Logit) Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} → {1} vs {2, 3, 4} → {2} vs {3, 4} → {3} vs {4}

            -   {1} vs. {2,3,4} could represent highschool graduation

            -   {2} vs. {3,4} could represesnt enrollment in post-secondary education

            -   {3} vs. {4} could represent completion of a post-secondary degree.

-   Assumptions

    -   Assumes Gumbel distribution of errors but relax the i.i.d. hypothesis
        -   Allows for the unobserved (and random) components of utility, $\epsilon_{nj}$ , to be correlated for the same decision maker

        -   Example: {drive} vs {carpool} and {bus} vs {train}

            -   Model allows from unobserved components of utility (i.e. residuals of the model) of drive and carpool to correlated for the same decision maker but not the unobserved components of utility for carpool and train.
    -   Assumes Exogenity (See [Multinomial Logit](regression-multinomial.qmd#sec-reg-multin-mnl){style="color: green"} \>\> Assumptions)
        -   This model is also bad for panel data

-   Choice Probability for alternative, i, and decision-maker, n

    $$
    P_{ni} = \frac {e^{V_{ni}/\lambda_k}(\sum_{j\in B_k}e^{V_{nj}/\lambda_k})^{\lambda_k - 1}}{\sum_{\ell=1}^K (\sum_{j\in B_\ell}e^{V_{nj}/\lambda_\ell})^{\lambda_\ell}}
    $$

    -   The probability that decision-maker, $n$, chooses alternative, $i$
        -   Predicted probability output from the model

        -   When data is at the market level, the $n$ index (i.e. individual) is removed from the equation above and the LHS becomes *Market Share* (See [Terms](regression-multinomial.qmd#sec-reg-multin-terms){style="color: green"}). The difference in market share between alternatives (e.g. brands) is:

            $$
            \ln(S_i) - \ln(S_m) = \hat{\beta}(x_i - x_m) + (1-\lambda_k)\ln S_{i|B_k} - (1-\lambda_\ell)S_{m|B_\ell}
            $$

            -   The index, $m$, is typically a reference level called the "outside option" which is alternative of NOT doing an action where the utility is 0.
                -   If the products were a product such as cereal, then the outside option would typically be "not buying cereal" which would have a utility is 0.
    -   $\lambda_k$ is a measuer of independence in dichotomy, $k$ that gets estimated
    -   $1-\lambda_k$ is a measure of the correlation within dichotomy, $k$
    -   The nested logit is consistent with the random utility model when $\lambda_k \in (0,1] \; \forall k$

-   Elasticity

    $$
    E_{iz{ni}} = \beta_z z_{ni} \left(\frac{1}{\lambda_k} - \frac{1-\lambda_k}{\lambda_k}P_{ni|B_k} - P_{ni}\right)
    $$

    -   Marginal Effects and Elasticities are similar except elasticities are percent change.
        -   e.g. a percentage change in a regressor results in this much of a percentage change in the response level probability
    -   Elasticity of alternate, $i$, in dichotomy, $k$, for decision-maker, $n$, with respect to its attribute, $z_{ni}$

-   Cross-Elasticity

    $$
    E_{iz_{nm}} = 
    \left\{ \begin{array}{lcl}
    -\beta_z z_{zm}P_{nm} \left(1+ \frac{1-\lambda_k}{\lambda_k} \frac {1}{P_{nB_k}} \right) & \mbox{if} \; m \in \beta_k \\
    -\beta_z z_{zm}P_{nm} & \mbox{if} \; m \notin \beta_k 
    \end{array}\right.
    $$

    -   Where

        $$
        P_{nB_k} = \sum \limits_{j \in B_k} P_{nj} \;\; \text{and} \;\; P_{ni|B_k} = \frac {P_{ni}}{P_{nB_k}} = \frac {P_{ni}}{\sum_{j \in B_k} P_{nj}}
        $$

    -   The percent change in the probability of choosing alternative, $i$, after a percent change in the attribute of alternative, $m$.

    -   Cross elasticity depends on whether both alternatives are in the same dichotomy.

    -   Data:

        -   "partic": labor force participation, the response, with levels:
            -   "fulltime": working full-time
            -   "not.work": not working outside the home
            -   "parttime" : working part-time.
        -   "hincome": Husband's income, in \$1,000s.
        -   "children": Presence of children in the home, `"absent"` or `"present"`.

    -   Set-up sets of dichotomies that you want analyze

        ``` r
        set1 <- 
          logits(work = dichotomy("not.work", 
                                  working = c("parttime", "fulltime")),
                 full = dichotomy("parttime", "fulltime"))

        set2 <-
          logits(full = dichotomy(nonfulltime = c("not.work", "parttime"),
                                  "fulltime"),
                 part = dichotomy("not.work", "parttime"))

        # How set1 response variables would be coded in base-R
        Womenlf <- within(Womenlf, {
          work = ifelse(partic == "not.work", 0, 1)
          full = ifelse(partic == "fulltime",  1,
                        ifelse(partic == "parttime", 0, NA))
        })
        ```

        -   set1:
            -   "work": Women who are NOT working outside the home vs. those who are working (either part-time or full-time).
            -   "full": Women who work full-time time vs. part-time, but among only those who work.
        -   set2:
            -   "full": {full-time} vs. {not working, part-time}
                -   The rationale is that the real hurdle for young married women to enter the paid labor force is to combine full-time work outside the home with housework.
            -   "part": {not working} vs. {part-time}.

    -   Fit 1st Set

        ``` r
        wlf.nested.one <- 
            nestedLogit(partic ~ hincome + children,
                        dichotomies = set1,
                        data = Womenlf)
        ```

        -   Fits 2 glm models
            -   `glm(formula = work ~ hincome + children, family = binomial, data = Womenlf)`

            -   `glm(formula = full ~ hincome + children, family = binomial, data = Womenlf)`
        -   A combined model is also produced using the Delta Method
        -   Estimates are calculated for all models and predicted probabilities for the category levels are from the combined model.

    -   Results

        ``` r
        # show as odds ratios
        exp(coef(wlf.nested))
        #>                   work     full
        #> (Intercept)     3.8032 32.38753
        #> hincome         0.9586  0.89829
        #> childrenpresent 0.2069  0.07055
        ```

        -   $\hat{\beta}_{\text{work, hincome}}$ gives the estimated change in the log-odds of working vs. not working associated with a \$1,000 increase in husband's income and with having children present, each holding the other constant.
        -   $\hat{\beta}_{\text{full, hincome}}$ same as above, but gives the estimated change the log-odds of working full-time vs. part-time among those who are working outside the home.
        -   Interpretation (after exponentiation): The odds of both working and working full-time decrease with husband's income, by about 4% and 10% respectively per \$1000. Having young children also decreases the odds of both working and working full-time, by about 79% and 93% respectively.

    -   Fit 2nd Set

        ``` r
        wlf.nested.two <- 
          nestedLogit(partic ~ hincome + children,
                      dictotomies = set2,
                      data=Womenlf)
        ```

    -   Results

        ``` r

        ```

        -   `summary` also shows all the typical model summary info, but only for each dichotomy and not the combined model.
        -   `Anova` will perform Chi-Square tests on each explanatory variable in each dichotomy and the combined model.
        -   The predictors husband's income and presence of children affect the decision to work full-time, but not the decision to work part-time among those who aren't engaged in full-time work. (See "Set-up sets of dichotomies" section describing this set's rationale)

    -   Compare Models

        ``` r
        fit1 <- predict(wlf.nested.one)$p
        fit2 <- predict(wlf.nested.two)$p

        diag(cor(fit1, fit2))
        #> not.work parttime fulltime 
        #>   0.9801   0.9185   0.9961

        mean(as.matrix(abs(fit1 - fit2)))
        #> [1] 0.01712

        max(abs(fit1 - fit2))
        #> [1] 0.1484

        # GoF
        logLik(wlf.nested.one)
        #> 'log Lik.' -212.1 (df=6)
        logLik(wlf.nested.two)
        #> 'log Lik.' -211.4 (df=6)
        AIC(wlf.nested.one, wlf.nested.two)
        #>                df   AIC
        #> wlf.nested      6 436.2
        #> wlf.nested.alt  6 434.9
        ```

        -   The fitted probabilities are similar but far from the same. (See next section for what "same" looks like)
        -   Since these models aren't nested within each other, you can't compare with an LR test (i.e. use a p-value), but you can still look at the Loglikelihoods.
        -   The GoF comparison slightly favors the alternative nested-dichotomies model (set2).

    -   Compare Model 2 with Multinomial Logit

        ``` r
        wlf.multinom <- nnet::multinom(partic ~ hincome + children, data = Womenlf)

        summary(wlf.multinom)
        #> Coefficients:

        fit3 <- predict(wlf.multinom, type="probs")[, c("not.work", "parttime", "fulltime")]
        diag(cor(fit2, fit3))
        #> not.work parttime fulltime 
        #>        1        1        1
        mean(as.matrix(abs(fit2 - fit3)))
        #> [1] 0.0001251
        max(abs(fit2 - fit3))
        #> [1] 0.0006908 
        ```

        -   The multinomial logit model and the alternative nested-dichotomies (i.e. set2) model produce nearly identical fits with similar simple interpretations.

## Mixed Logit

-   Individual heterogeneity can be introduced in the parameters associated with the covariates entering the observable part of the utility or in the variance of the errors.

-   Doesn't exhibit IIA (See [Multinomial Logit \>\> Substitution Patterns](regression-multinomial.qmd#sec-reg-multin-mnl){style="color: green"}) since correlations between alternatives are modeled.

-   Model creates a distribution of $\beta$s, so $\beta$ is allowed to vary throughout a population.

-   Market Level Data

    -   Observe price, market share, and characteristics of a product

-   Choice Probability

    $$
    \begin{align}
    &P_{ni} = \int L_{ni}(\beta) \; f(\beta\;|\;\boldsymbol{\theta}) \; d\beta\\
    &\mbox{where} \; L_{ni}(\beta) = \frac {e^{V_{ni}(\beta)}}{\sum_{j=1}^J e^{V_{ni}(\beta)}} 
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ is a vector of distributional parameters (e.g. $\mu, \sigma^2$ for a Normal Distribution)
        -   **The** $\theta$ **parameters are what get estimated by the model in order to calculate a distribution of** $\beta$**s** (i.e. Bayesian posterior)
    -   Integrates over a density so there is not a closed form solution. Therefore, numerical simulation must be used.
        -   **Elasticities** don't have a closed form solution either (Assume **Marginal Effects** are the same way)
    -   Think of it as a weighted average of logit choice probabilities
        -   The logit choice probabilities are evaluated a different values of $\beta$, and each logit choice probability is weighted by the density $f(\beta\;|\;\boldsymbol{\theta})$
            -   i.e. Based on the density, more likely $\beta$s will be more heavily weighted.
    -   In statistical language, it's a mixed function of logit choice probabilities, $L_{ni}(\beta)$, and the mixing distribution, $f(\beta\;|\;\boldsymbol{\theta})$

-   Random Coefficients

    $$
    U_{nj} = \hat{\alpha}\boldsymbol{x}_{nj} + \hat{\mu}\boldsymbol{z}_{nj} + \epsilon_{nj}
    $$

    -   $x_{nj}$, $z_{nj}$ - data for alternative j and decision maker n

    -   $\hat{\alpha}$ - vector of fixed coefficients (i.e. same for all decision makers)

    -   $\hat{\mu}_n$ - vector of random coefficients (i.e. a coefficient for each decision maker)

    -   $\epsilon_{nj}$ - residual from an extreme value distribution (e.g. Gumbel)

-   Correlated Random Utility

    -   Let $\nu_{nj} = \boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}}_n \boldsymbol{z}_{nj} + \epsilon_{nj}$ be the random (unobserved) component of utility and $\mbox{Cov}(\nu_{ni}, \nu_{nj}) = \boldsymbol{z}_{ni} \Sigma \boldsymbol{z}_{nj}$ the covariance between random utilities of different alternatives where $\Sigma$ is the variance/covariance matrix for $\boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}}$

    -   This is a structure to model the correlation between alternatives

-   Panel Data

    -   Data where each decision maker makes multiple choices over time periods

    -   Model allows for unobserved preference variation through random coefficients, which yields correlations in utility over time for the same decision maker

    -   Decision maker, n, chooses from a vector of alternatives over T time periods

    -   Utility

        $$
        U_{njt} = \hat{\beta}_n x_{njt} + \epsilon_{njt}
        $$

        -   The utility, U, for decision maker, n, in choosing alternative, j, at time period, t.

        -   $\hat{\beta}$ varies for each decision maker but is constant across time.

    -   Lag or lead predictors can be included

    -   Lagged responses can included

    -   Only models a sequence of static choices

        -   A fully dynamic discrete choice model would model how every choice affects subsequent choices.

-   Example: {mlogit}

    -   "rpar" specifies the random coefficients

## Multinomial Probit {#sec-reg-multin-mprob .unnumbered}

-   Assumes a Normal distribution of errors which can deal with heteroscedasticity and correlation of the errors.
