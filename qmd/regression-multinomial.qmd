-   AKA Random Utility or Choice Models

-   Goal: Model the category probabilities for a polytomous (i.e. \# of categoies \> 2) response

    -   Let $\phi_{ij} \equiv \phi_j(\vec{x_i})$ be the probability of response category j for unit i given predictor $\vec{x_i}$ .

    -   Since the sum of the probabilities of all the categories equals 1, if you know m-1 probabilities for m categories, then you know the probability for the last category, $\phi_{im}$.

        $$
        \phi_{im} = 1 - \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} \phi_{ij}
        $$

    -   The essential idea is to construct a model for the polytomous response composed of m−1 logit comparisons among the response categories in a manner analogous to the treatment of factors in the predictor variables (i.e. creating dummy variables for the m-1 categories).

        -   Nested dichotomies are statistically independent, and hence provide an additive decomposition of tests for the overall polytomous response. When the dichotomies make sense substantively, this method can be a simpler alternative to the standard multinomial logistic model which compares response categories to a reference level.

        -   Offers speedups of 10 - 50 times for modestly sized problems and more than 100 times for larger problems. Running in parallel mode on a multicore machine gives up to 4 times additional speedup on 8 processor cores. mnlogit achieves its computational efficiency by drastically speeding up computation of the log-likelihood function's Hessian matrix through exploiting structure in matrices that arise in intermediate calculations.

## Terms {#sec-reg-multin-terms .unnumbered}

-   [**Random Utility**]{style="color: #009499"} - utility theory can readily be understood as the idea that people behave in line with self-interset where self-interest reflects peoples' needs to save time and economize on effort. These models rely on the hypothesis that the decision maker is able to rank the different alternatives by an order of preference represented by a utility function, the chosen alternative being the one which is associated with the highest level of utility. They are called random utility models because part of the utility is unobserved and is modeled as the realization of a random deviate.

    -   Notes from [ResEcon 703 Video Course](https://www.youtube.com/@ResEcon703UMassAmherst/playlists)
        -   Weeks 3, 4
-   Agent gets some amount of utility from each of the alternatives (set of actions the user can choose from)
-   The amount of utility for each alternative and each decision maker can depend on:
    -   observed characteristics of the alternative themselves

    -   observed characteristics of the decision maker

    -   unobserved characteristics
-   Utility is *not* observed but can be inferred by factors that are observed (and how each factor affects Utility):
    -   Chosen alternative, i, by each decision maker, n

    -   Some attributes about each alternative

    -   Some attributes about each decision maker.
-   Total Utility: $U_{nj} = V_{nj} + \epsilon_{nj}$
    -   Where Representative (observed) Utility, $V_{nj} = V(x_{nj}, s_n)$
        -   $x_{nj}$ is the vector of attributes for alternative j specific to decison maker n

        -   $s_n$ is the vector of attributes for decision maker n\\
    -   $\epsilon_{nj}$ is called the "Random Utility" which is unobserved (i.e. the stuff we didn't adjust for).
-   Utility Model: $U_{nj} = \hat{\beta}x_{nj} + \epsilon_{nj}$
    -   Since $U_{nj}$ is unobserved, decision maker choice from alternatives is used as the response variable to proxy Utility.
    -   $\beta$ is called a "structural parameter"
-   Marginal Effects
    -   The change in the probability of choosing alternative, i, after a change in the attribute of alternative, i.
    -   $\text{ME} = \frac {\partial P_{ni}} {\partial z_{ni}} = \beta_z P_{ni}(1-P_{ni})$
    -   $P_{ni}$ is the probability of decision maker, n, choosing alternative i.
    -   Cross ME
        -   The change in the probability of choosing alternative, i, after a change in the attribute of alternative, j.

        -   $\text{CME} = \frac {\partial P_{ni}} {\partial z_{nj}} = -\beta_z P_{ni}P_{nj}$
-   Elasticity
    -   Marginal Effects and Elasticities are similar except elasticities are percent change.
        -   e.g. a percentage change in a regressor results in this much of a percentage change in the response level probability
    -   $E_{iz_{ni}} = \beta_z z_{ni} (1-P_{ni})$
        -   $E_{iz_{ni}}$ is the elasticity of the probability of alternative, i, with respect to $z_{ni}$, an observed attribute of alternative, i

        -   $P_{ni}$ is the predicted probability of alternative, i, for decision maker, n.
    -   Cross Elasticity
        -   $E_{iz_{ni}} = -\beta_z z_{nj} P_{nj}$
-   Multinomial Logit
    -   Choice Probability for alternative, i, and user, n:

        $$
        P_{ni} = \frac {e^{V_{ni}}}{\sum_j e^{V_{nj}}} = \frac {e^{\hat{\beta}x_{ni}}}{\sum_j e^{{\hat{\beta}x_{nj}}}}
        $$
-   Issue: Independence of Irrelavent Alternatives (IIA) Property of Logit models
    -   Also referred to as Proportional Substitution when dealing with elasticities
    -   Example: car, blue bus , red bus
        -   In the beginning, the decision maker only has 2 choices: drive car or ride blue bus.
        -   The probability of choosing the alternative car is the same for a decision maker as choosing the alternative blue bus: $P_c = P_{bb} = 1/2$
        -   Then a red bus is added to the choices, but the decision maker doesn't care whether the bus is red or blue. Therefore the blue bus and the red bus have the same choice probability: $P_{bb} = P_{rb}$
        -   But from the IIA property, the ratio of choice probability between car and blue bus is not changed after introduction of the red bus. Therefore, $P_c = P_{bb} = P_{rb} = 1/3$
        -   In reality, the choice probability for car has NOT decreased, since for decision maker, the choice is actually between car and bus --- color isn't a relative factor
    -   Example: Hummer, Escalade, Prius
        -   Hummer lowers price.
        -   Will Hummer attract more Escalade drivers than Prius?
        -   The logit model says that "proportional substitution to the Hummer will be equal for the Escalade and the Prius.
            -   i.e. The lowering of the Hummer price will have an equal effect on Escalade sales and Prius sales which is unrealistic
    -   Solutions:
        -   None mentioned yet, but it seems when measuring the effect of decrease in price for Hummers, for example, you shouldn't included Priuses in your choice set and only include vehicles in the same class.
-   Market Shares
    -   Market Share for alternative, i

        $$
        S_i = \frac {e^{V_i}}{\sum_j e^{V_j}}
        $$

    -   The difference in market share of products i and j

        $$
        \ln (S_i) - \ln (S_j) = \hat{\beta} (x_i - x_j)
        $$

        -   $x_i$ is a set of variables that describe product i.
            -   Therefore these will be the same for every decision-maker.
        -   $j$ is typicially a reference level (aka *outside option*)
            -   If the products were a product such as cereal, then the outside option would typically be "not buying cereal" where the utility is 0.
-   Model assumes Exogenity of the attribute variables of the alternatives: $\mathbb{E}[\epsilon \; | \; \vec {x}] = 0$ (i.e mean of the residuals is 0)
    -   Example of Endogenity
        -   Taking a car to work or taking the bus to work are the alternatives.
        -   If a commuter likes to drive, they won't care about living close to a bus stop
        -   If a commuter likes to take the bus, they are more likely to live close to a bus stop
        -   Therefore your logit model will be biased because any attribute variable that is related to the distance a decision-maker is from a bus stop will be endogenous.
            -   e.g. Time each mode of transportation takes to get to work will be endogenous because distance from the bus stop affects time and distance to bus stop is correlated with a decision maker already biased towards buses and not with a decision maker who would choose bus or car.
                -   i.e. distance isn't randomly distributed among all decision makers.
    -   Solution: TBD in a later lecture
-   Data sets used to estimate random utility models have therefore a specific structure that can be characterized by three indexes: the alternative, the choice situation, and the individual. The distinction between choice situation and individual indexes is only relevant if we have repeated observations for the same individual.
    -   Examples of variable types

        -   Choice Situation Specific
            -   data1: Length of the vacation and the Season
            -   data2: values of dist, income and urban are repeated four times.
                -   dist (the distance of the trip)

                -   income (household income),

                -   urban (a dummy for trips which have a large city at

                    the origin or the destination)

                -   noalt the number of available alternatives
        -   Individual Specific
            -   data1: Income and Family Size
            -   data2: None
        -   Alternative Specific
            -   data1: Distance to Destination and Cost
            -   data2:
                -   transport modes (air, train, bus and car)
                -   cost for monetary cost
                -   ivt for in vehicle time
                -   ovt for out of vehicle time
                -   freq for frequency

    -   The unit of observation is therefore the choice situation, and it is also the individual if thereis only one choice situation per individual observed, which is often the case

    -   Data Descriptions

        -   Each individual has responded to several (up to 16) scenarios.
        -   For every scenario, two train tickets A and B are proposed to the user, with different combinations of four attributes: price (the price in cents of guilders), time (travel time in minutes), change (the number of changes) and comfort (the class of comfort, 0, 1 or 2, 0 being the most comfortable class).

    -   Dataset in wide format

        ``` r
        #>    id choiceid choice price_A time_A change_A comfort_A price_B time_B
        #> 1  1  1        A      2400    150    0        1         4000    150
        #> 2  1  2        A      2400    150    0        1         3200    130

        #>    change_B comfort_B
        #> 1  0        1
        #> 2  0        1
        #> 3  0        0
        ```

    -   Transform to long format and add index attribute with {dfidx}

        ``` r
        Tr <- 
          dfidx(Train, 
                shape = "wide", 
                choice = "choice",
                varying = 4:11, 
                sep = "_", 
                idx = list(c("choiceid", "id")),
                idnames = c("chid", "alt"),
                opposite = c("price", "comfort", "time", "change"))

        head(Tr, 3)

        ```

        -   In "long" format (default) is a data.frame with a special column which containsthe corresponding indexes. A lot of these argument values are passed to `reshape` to produce the final format.

        -   "varying" - Indicates alternative specific variables which is a numeric vector that indicates their position in the data frame.

        -   "sep" - In wide format, variable names are of the form, `<var>_choice` (default ".").

        -   "choice" - Indicates the response that has to be transformed in a logical value

        -   "idx" - Adds attribute which specifies the nesting structure of the id variables

            -   Each individual faces different choice situations, the "id" variable, which contains the individual index, nests the choice situation variable called "choiceid."

            -   Contains the three relevant indexes: choiceid is the choice situation index, alt the alternative index and id is the individual index.

        -   "opposite" - If you expect negative coefficients, taking the opposite of the covariates will lead to expected positive coefficients. (?)

    -   Add idx attribute to an already long formatted df

        ``` r
        MC <- 
          MC <- dfidx(ModeCanada, 
                      subset = noalt == 4,
                      idx = c("case", "alt"))
        ```

        -   Order of variables doesn't seem to matter for the "idx" arg in order to specify index types

        -   The primary dplyr verbs can be applied to dfidx objects

## Multinomial Logit (MNL) {#sec-reg-multin-mnl .unnumbered}

-   AKA Generalized Logit
-   When the polytomous response has m levels, the multinomial logit model comprises m−1 log-odds comparisons with a reference level, typically the first or last.
    -   The likelihood under the model and the fitted response probabilities that it produces are unaffected by choice of reference level, much as choice of reference level for dummy regressors created from a factor predictor doesn't affect the fit of a regression model.
-   Assumes identical and independent errors following a Gumbel distribution

## Nested Logit {#sec-reg-multin-nestlog .unnumbered}

-   Fits separate models for each of a hierarchically nested set of binary comparisons among the response categories. The set of m−1 models comprises a complete model for the polytomous response, just as the multinomial logit model does.

-   Assumes Gumbel distribution of errors but relax the i.i.d. hypothesis

-   Both MNL and Nested Logit methods have have p×(m−1) parameters. The models are not equivalent, however, in that they generally produce different sets of fitted category probabilities and hence different likelihoods.

    -   Multinomial logit model treats the response categories symmetrically

-   By the construction of nested dichotomies, the submodels are statistically independent (because the likelihood for the polytomous response is the product of the likelihoods for the dichotomies), so test statistics, such as likelihood ratio (G^2^) and Wald chi-square tests for regression coefficients can be summed to give overall tests for the full polytomy.

-   Nested dichotomies are not unique and alternative sets of nested dichotomies are not equivalent: Different choices have different interpretations. Moreover, and more fundamentally, fitted probabilities and hence the likelihood for the nested-dichotomies model depend on how the nested dichotomies are defined.

-   Example: 2 methods of splitting a 4-level response into dichotomies\
    ![](_resources/Regression-Multinomial.resources/nested-dichot1.jpg){width="473"}

    -   Left: Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} → {1,2} vs {3,4} → {1} vs {2} and {3} vs {4}

    -   Right: (Continuous Logit) Y = {1, 2, 3, 4} → {1} vs {2, 3, 4} → {2} vs {3, 4} → {3} vs {4}

        -   {1} vs. {2,3,4} could represent highschool graduation

        -   {2} vs. {3,4} could represesnt enrollment in post-secondary education

        -   {3} vs. {4} could represent completion of a post-secondary degree.

    -   Data:

        -   "partic": labor force participation, the response, with levels:

            -   "fulltime": working full-time

            -   "not.work": not working outside the home

            -   "parttime" : working part-time.

        -   "hincome": Husband's income, in \$1,000s.

        -   "children": Presence of children in the home, `"absent"` or `"present"`.

    -   Set-up sets of dichotomies that you want analyze

        set1 <- 
          logits(work = dichotomy("not.work", 
                                  working = c("parttime", "fulltime")),
                 full = dichotomy("parttime", "fulltime"))

        set2 <-
          logits(full = dichotomy(nonfulltime = c("not.work", "parttime"),
                                  "fulltime"),
                 part = dichotomy("not.work", "parttime"))

        # How set1 response variables would be coded in base-R
        Womenlf <- within(Womenlf, {
          work = ifelse(partic == "not.work", 0, 1)
          full = ifelse(partic == "fulltime",  1,
                        ifelse(partic == "parttime", 0, NA))
        })
        ```

        -   set1:
            -   "work": Women who are NOT working outside the home vs. those who are working (either part-time or full-time).
            -   "full": Women who work full-time time vs. part-time, but among only those who work.
        -   set2:
            -   "full": {full-time} vs. {not working, part-time}
                -   The rationale is that the real hurdle for young married women to enter the paid labor force is to combine full-time work outside the home with housework.
            -   "part": {not working} vs. {part-time}.

    -   Fit 1st Set

        ``` r

                        dichotomies = set1,
                        data = Womenlf)
        ```

        -   Fits 2 glm models
            -   `glm(formula = work ~ hincome + children, family = binomial, data = Womenlf)`

            -   `glm(formula = full ~ hincome + children, family = binomial, data = Womenlf)`
        -   A combined model is also produced using the Delta Method
        -   Estimates are calculated for all models and predicted probabilities for the category levels are from the combined model.

    -   Results

        ``` r
        # show as odds ratios
        exp(coef(wlf.nested))
        #>                   work     full

        #> childrenpresent 0.2069  0.07055
        ```

        -   $\hat{\beta}_{\text{work, hincome}}$ gives the estimated change in the log-odds of working vs. not working associated with a \$1,000 increase in husband's income and with having children present, each holding the other constant.
        -   $\hat{\beta}_{\text{full, hincome}}$ same as above, but gives the estimated change the log-odds of working full-time vs. part-time among those who are working outside the home.
        -   Interpretation (after exponentiation): The odds of both working and working full-time decrease with husband's income, by about 4% and 10% respectively per \$1000. Having young children also decreases the odds of both working and working full-time, by about 79% and 93% respectively.

        -   `summary` also shows all the typical model summary info, but only for each dichotomy and not the combined model.
        -   `Anova` will perform Chi-Square tests on each explanatory variable in each dichotomy and the combined model.
        -   The predictors husband's income and presence of children affect the decision to work full-time, but not the decision to work part-time among those who aren't engaged in full-time work. (See "Set-up sets of dichotomies" section describing this set's rationale)

    -   Compare Models

        ``` r
        fit1 <- predict(wlf.nested.one)$p
        fit2 <- predict(wlf.nested.two)$p

        diag(cor(fit1, fit2))
        #> not.work parttime fulltime 
        #>   0.9801   0.9185   0.9961

        mean(as.matrix(abs(fit1 - fit2)))
        #> [1] 0.01712

        max(abs(fit1 - fit2))
        #> [1] 0.1484

        # GoF
        logLik(wlf.nested.one)
        #> 'log Lik.' -212.1 (df=6)
        logLik(wlf.nested.two)
        #> 'log Lik.' -211.4 (df=6)
        AIC(wlf.nested.one, wlf.nested.two)
        #>                df   AIC
        #> wlf.nested      6 436.2
        #> wlf.nested.alt  6 434.9
        ```

        -   The fitted probabilities are similar but far from the same. (See next section for what "same" looks like)
        -   Since these models aren't nested within each other, you can't compare with an LR test (i.e. use a p-value), but you can still look at the Loglikelihoods.
        -   The GoF comparison slightly favors the alternative nested-dichotomies model (set2).

    -   Compare Model 2 with Multinomial Logit

        ``` r
        wlf.multinom <- nnet::multinom(partic ~ hincome + children, data = Womenlf)

        summary(wlf.multinom)
        #> Coefficients:
        #>          (Intercept)   hincome childrenpresent
        #> parttime      -1.432  0.006894         0.02146
        #> fulltime       1.983 -0.097232        -2.55861
        #>  AIC: 434.9

        logLik(wlf.multinom)
        #> 'log Lik.' -211.4 (df=6)

        fit3 <- predict(wlf.multinom, type="probs")[, c("not.work", "parttime", "fulltime")]
        diag(cor(fit2, fit3))
        #> not.work parttime fulltime 
        #>        1        1        1
        mean(as.matrix(abs(fit2 - fit3)))
        #> [1] 0.0001251
        max(abs(fit2 - fit3))
        #> [1] 0.0006908 
        ```

        -   The multinomial logit model and the alternative nested-dichotomies (i.e. set2) model produce nearly identical fits with similar simple interpretations.

## Multinomial Probit {#sec-reg-multin-mprob .unnumbered}

-   Assumes a Normal distribution of errors which can deal with heteroscedasticity and correlation of the errors.
