## Misc

-   Some Excel files are binaries and in order to use `download.file`, you must set [mode = "wb"]{.arg-text}

    ``` r
    download.file(url, 
                  destfile = glue("{rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file()}/data/cases-age.xlsx"), 
                  mode = "wb")
    ```

-   Notes from [Data organization in spreadsheets](https://peerj.com/preprints/3183/)
    -   Be consistent
    -   Write dates like YYYY-MM-DD
    -   Don't leave any cells empty
    -   Put just one thing in a cell
    -   Organize the data as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows and variables as columns, and with a single header row)
    -   Create a data dictionary
    -   Don't include calculations in the raw data files
    -   Don't use font color or highlighting as data
    -   Choose good names for things
    -   Make backups
    -   Use data validation to avoid data entry errors
    -   Save the data in plain text files.
