## Docker {#sec-shiny-prod-dock .unnumbered}

### Misc {#sec-shiny-prod-dock-misc .unnumbered}

-   Packages
    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[deps](https://hub.analythium.io/deps/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} ([article](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/10/manage-dependencies-with-the-deps-r-package-for-docker-containers/))
        -   Lightweight method that installs packages via a DESCRIPTION json file
            -   Blend between package and renv approaches to dependency management
        -   Project scripts contain roxygen-like, decorator code about packages and those are used to build the DESCRIPTION json file
        -   Image size should be similar to the "deps/DESCRIPTION" method above
    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[shinydocker](https://r-pkg.thecoatlessprofessor.com/shinydocker/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} ([Intro](https://blog.thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r/rethinking-shiny-containerization-the-shinydocker-experiment/)) - Containerizes Shiny applications by automatically generating Docker configurations, building images, and managing containers. It supports both R and Python Shiny apps with intelligent detection of app type and dependencies.

### Images {#sec-shiny-prod-dock-img .unnumbered}

-   Images have a 2GB limit
-   Base Image Build Times\
    ![](./_resources/Shiny,_Production.resources/Screenshot%20(1054).png){.lightbox width="432"}
    -   Smaller images take longer to load because all the packages/libraries have to be compiled
    -   rstudio/base, rocker/shiny, rocker/r-ubuntu use binary packages
    -   rocker/r-bspm and eddelbuettel/r2u uses binary packages and apt-get
-   Order of Image Layers\
    ![](./_resources/Shiny,_Production.resources/Screenshot%20(1055).png){.lightbox width="432"}
    -   Order is bottom to top when writing your dockerfile. (see example below)
    -   Important for the bottom layers to be things that you might change most often. This way you don't have to reinstall R everytime you change something in your app code.

### Dockerfiles {#sec-shiny-prod-dock-dfile .unnumbered}

-   [Example 1]{.ribbon-highlight}

    ``` dockerfile
    From rocker/r-base:4.0.4

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        --no-install-recommneds \
        make libssl-dev libxml2-dev \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    COPY Rprofile.site /etc/R
    RUN install.r shiny ggplot2 htmltools plotly

    RUN addgroup --system app && adduser --system --ingroup app app
    WORKDIR /home/app
    COPY app .
    RUN chown app:app -R /home/app
    USER app

    EXPOSE 3838
    CMD ["R", "-e", "shiny::runApp('/home/app', port = 3838, host = '0.0.0.0')"]
    ```

-   [Example 2]{.ribbon-highlight} ([source](https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-12-02-r-docker/))

    ``` dockerfile
    # Use the official R base image  
    FROM rocker/r-ver:4.3.1  

    # Install system dependencies (if needed)  
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \  
        libcurl4-openssl-dev \  
        libssl-dev \  
        libxml2-dev \  
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  

    # Set the working directory  
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app  

    # Copy your project files  
    COPY . .  

    # Install R dependencies  
    RUN Rscript -e "install.packages('renv')"
    RUN Rscript -e "renv::restore()"

    # Define the entry point  
    CMD ["Rscript", "app.R"]  
    ```

### Dependencies {#sec-shiny-prod-dock-dep .unnumbered}

-   Methods ([article](https://hosting.analythium.io/dockerized-shiny-apps-with-dependencies/))

    ``` dockerfile
    # Explicit
    RUN install.r shiny ggplot2 htmltools plotly

    # DESCRIPTION file
    RUN install.r remotes
    COPY DESCRIPTION .
    RUN Rscript -e "remotes::install_deps()"

    # renv package
    RUN install.r remotes renv
    COPY ./renv.lock .
    RUN Rscript -e "options(renv.consent=TRUE); renv::restore(lockfiile='/home/app/renv.lock')"
    ```

    -   `littler::install.r` ({littler} is installed on all Rocker images)

-   Image Size Comparison

    ```         
    REPOSITORY                  TAG                SIZE
    analythium/covidapp-shiny  renv                1.7GB
    analythium/covidapp-shiny  deps                1.18GB
    analythium/covidapp-shiny  basic               1.24GB
    ```

    -   [basic]{.var-text} Image (aka "explicit" method): 105 packages installed
    -   [deps]{.var-text} Image (aka "DESCRIPTION" method): Has remotes added on top of these; `remotes::install_deps()` to install packages from the DESCRIPTION file
    -   [renv]{.var-text} Image: Has remotes, renv and BH as extras.
        -   BH seems to be responsible for the size difference, this package provides Boost C++ header files.
        -   Your app will probably work perfectly fine without BH.
        -   You can use `renv::remove("BH")` to remove BH from the project or use the "custom" model and list all the packages to be added to the lockfile

### Security {#sec-shiny-prod-dock-sec .unnumbered}

-   Example: Dockerfile

    ``` dockerfile
    RUN addgroup --system app && adduser --system --ingroup app app
    WORKDIR /home/app
    COPY app .
    RUN chown app:app -R /home/app
    USER app
    ```

    -   Best to create user groups and not run app as a root sudo
    -   `chown`, an abbreviation of change owner, is used on Unix and Unix-like operating systems to change the owner of file system files, directories. Unprivileged users who wish to change the group membership of a file that they own may use chgrp

### Compose

-   [Example]{.ribbon-highlght}: With postgres and shiny server ([source](https://rse-book.github.io/infrastructure.html#docker-compose-manage-multiple-containers))

    ``` yaml
    services:
       postgres:
          # a name, e.g.,  db_container is 
          # instrumental to be
          # called as host from the shiny app
          container_name: db_container
          build: ./postgres
          restart: always
          environment:
             - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
             - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
          # This port mapping is only necessary 
          # to connect from the host, 
          # not to let containers talk to each other. 
          ports:
             - "5432:5432"
          volumes:
             - "./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data"
       shiny: 
          container_name: shiny
          depends_on: 
             - postgres
          build: ./shiny
          volumes:
             - "./shiny-logs:/var/log/shiny-server"
             - "./shiny-home:/srv/shiny-server"
          ports:
             - "3838:3838"
    ```

### CI/CD {#sec-shiny-prod-dock-cicd .unnumbered}

![](./_resources/Shiny,_Production.resources/Screenshot%20(1058).png){.lightbox width="432"}

-   Use github action for docker caching which builds the image and pushes your image to Docker Hub
-   Then your compute instance (PaaS) pulls the image from that registry

## Data Strategies {#sec-shiny-prod-datstrat .unnumbered}

-   Do as little processing as possible in the app
-   Bundle datasets alongside the source code, such that wherever the app is deployed, those datasets are available.
    -   Drawback: data would need to be kept in version control along with your source code, and a new deployment of the app would be required whenever the data is updated.
        -   For frequently updated datasets, this is impractical, but may be valuable if those datasets are unlikely to change during the lifetime of a project.
    -   Excellent for small to medium datasets (realistically up to 2-3 GB in memory, with correct design)
-   Keep data in cloud storage
    -   Allows collaborators to upload new data on an ad-hoc basis without touching the app itself. The app would then download data from the cloud for presentation during each user session
    -   Better for frequently updated datasets
    -   Optimization (loading in secs instead of mins)
        -   Use parquet file format
        -   [Caching](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/caching.html) the data for the app’s landing page or use [asynchronous computing](https://rstudio.github.io/promises/articles/shiny.html) to initiate downloading the data while presenting a less data-intensive landing page
        -   Pipeline\
            ![](./_resources/Shiny,_Production.resources/image.png){.lightbox width="342"}
            -   Partition data:
                -   Raw data that is not computationally expensive or needs no processing
                -   Processed data that is more computationally expensive to process.
            -   The data processing pipeline is outside of the app. (e.g. GitHub Actions workflow)
            -   Data storage and app server should be in the same region to reduce latency
        -   Create Pipeline Triggers
            -   When new raw data is uploaded, then data gets processed and into the app in a timely manner.
            -   When the source code for the app or the data processing pipeline change, the data processing pipeline should run afresh.
            -   If changes to the structure of the raw dataset mean that the data processing pipeline produces malformed processed data, there should be a way to log that.
-   [{pins}]{style="color: #990000"}
    -   Also see [Databases, Engineering \>\> Misc](db-engineering.qmd#sec-db-eng-misc){style="color: green"} \>\> [{pins}]{style="color: #990000"}

    -   Everytime the pin is updated, `pin_reactive_read` also updates the data within the shiny app

        -   You can also set a fixed update time within the function

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: [How to use pins + Shiny for ever-changing data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2OK8IWJWhk)

        ``` r
        board <-
          board_connect(server = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER"),
                        key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY"))

        name = "isabella.velasquez/shiny-calendar-pin"

        server <- function(input, output, session) {

          reactive_pin <- pins::pin_reactive_read(name = name, board = board)

          r <- reactiveValues(all_data = NULL, filtered_data = NULL)

          observe({
            req(reactive_pin())
            all_results <- reactive_pin() |>
              as.data.frame() |>
              filter(!is.na(title) & !is.na(duedate)) |>
              rowid_to_column("id")

            r$all_data <- all_results
            r$filtered_data <- all_results
          })
        }
        ```

### Tips {#sec-shiny-prod-opt-tips .unnumbered}

-   Reduce the amount of computation occuring inside the app
    -   caching plots and tables, or by precomputing your data
    -   Memoise and Pins
-   Too many users? (Shiny is single threaded)
    -   Temporary Fix: Deploy multiple instances of the app
-   Queries
    -   Query Optimization
    -   Pagination/Lazy Loading
-   Benchmark importng data into your app\
    ![](_resources/Shiny,_Production.resources/opt-query-bench-1.png){.lightbox width="332"}
-   Analyze whether the app could be using too much reactivity or regenerating UI elements unnecessarily
-   Interactive tables and charts can cause the app to lag for large datasets (e.g. 6M rows, 43 fields)
-   Vectorization code where possible
-   Use columnar file formats (e.g. arrow)

### Google Lighthouse {#sec-shiny-prod-opt-light .unnumbered}

-   [Misc]{.underline}
    -   [Docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/)
    -   Notes from
        -   Video: [Jumping Rivers: Lightning Talks](https://youtu.be/myjDntTHtbw?t=519)
    -   Can be used for benchmarking your shiny app in terms of page loading
    -   Study of Apps from the 2021 Shiny App Contest
        -   Distribution of *values* across all metrics\
            ![](_resources/Shiny,_Production.resources/opt-light-study-distr-1.png){.lightbox width="532"}
        -   \*Apps with htmlwidgets can have misleading values LCP and FCP metrics\*
            -   i.e. [{plotly}]{style="color: #990000"} chart frames would load before the chart and the metric value would be measured to when the frame loaded
        -   Scores (n = 134, avg score = 73)
            -   Good Performance: 40
            -   Needs Improvement: 74
            -   Poor: 20
-   [Set-Up]{.underline}
    -   Goto Chrome Dev Tools (i.e. inspect, `ctrl+shift+j`) while at your app's url. On the navbar, click "\>\>" and you'll see Lighthouse. Click Analyze Page Load.
    -   Or locally
        -   Install via npm

            ``` bash
            npm install -g lighthouse

            lighthouse --output json --output-path path/to/directory file_name.json url
            ```

            -   [output]{.arg-text}: json is the file type of the report (csv available too)
            -   [ouput-path]{.arg-text}: The path where you want the report file
            -   `file_name.json` is the file name
            -   [url]{.arg-text}: The url for your app
            -   Add flag, `--preset desktop`, to benchmark it for a simulated user on a desktop
                -   Default is [mobile]{.arg-text} which simulates a user accessing the app on their phone.
-   [Metrics]{.underline}
    -   [Scores]{.underline}
        -   Each raw metric *value* is converted into a metric score from 0 to 100 by looking where the metric value falls on its Lighthouse scoring distribution.

            -   The scoring distribution is a log-normal distribution derived from the performance metrics of real website performance data on HTTP Archive.

        -   Guidelines (Scores)

            |          |                            |
            |:---------|:---------------------------|
            | 90 – 100 | Green (Good)               |
            | 50 – 89  | Orange (Needs Improvement) |
            | Under 49 | Red (Poor)                 |
    -   [First Contentful Paint (FCP)]{.underline} - Measures the time from when the user first navigated to the page to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen. For this metric, "content" refers to text, images, etc.
        -   Guidelines (Values)
            -   Mobile

                |          |                   |
                |:---------|:------------------|
                | 0 – 1.8s | Green (fast)      |
                | 1.9 – 3s | Orange (moderate) |
                | Over 3s  | Red (slow)        |

            -   Desktop

                |            |                   |
                |:-----------|:------------------|
                | 0 – 0.9s   | Green (fast)      |
                | 1.0 – 1.6s | Orange (moderate) |
                | Over 1.6s  | Red (slow)        |
    -   [Speed Index (SI)]{.underline} - Measures how quickly content is visually displayed during page load. Lighthouse first captures a video of the page loading in the browser and computes the visual progression between frames. Lighthouse then uses the Speedline Node.js module to generate the Speed Index score
        -   Guidelines (Values)
            -   Mobile

                |            |                   |
                |:-----------|:------------------|
                | 0 – 3.4s   | Green (fast)      |
                | 3.5 – 5.8s | Orange (moderate) |
                | Over 5.8s  | Red (slow)        |

            -   Desktop

                |            |                   |
                |:-----------|:------------------|
                | 0 – 1.3s   | Green (fast)      |
                | 1.4 – 2.3s | Orange (moderate) |
                | Over 2.3s  | Red (slow)        |
    -   [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)]{.underline} - Measures perceived load speed. It marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's *main* content has likely loaded—a fast LCP helps reassure the user that the page is useful.
        -   Guidelines: Desktop and Mobile (Values)

            |            |                            |
            |:-----------|:---------------------------|
            | 0 – 2.5s   | Green (good)               |
            | 2.6 – 4.0s | Orange (needs improvement) |
            | Over 4.0s  | Red (poor)                 |
    -   [Total Blocking Time (TBT)]{.underline} - Measures the total amount of time after First Contentful Paint (FCP) where the main thread was blocked for long enough to prevent input responsiveness.
        -   The main thread is "blocked" when the browser cannot interrupt a task that's in progress. So in the event that a user *does* interact with the page in the middle of a long task, the browser must wait for the task to finish before it can respond.
        -   If the task is long enough (anything higher than 50 milliseconds), it's likely that the user will notice the delay and perceive the page as sluggish or broken.
        -   Guideline (Values): Less than 200 milliseconds when tested on average mobile hardware is good.
    -   [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)]{.underline} - Measures the largest burst of *layout shift scores* for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifecycle of a page.
        -   A *layout shift* occurs any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next.

        -   A *burst* of layout shifts, known as a *session window*, is when one or more individual layout shifts occur in rapid succession with less than 1-second in between each shift and a maximum of 5 seconds for the total window duration.

        -   The *largest* burst is the session window with the maximum cumulative score of all layout shifts within that window.

        -   Guideline: For mobile and desktop (Values)

            |              |                            |
            |:-------------|:---------------------------|
            | 0 – 0.1s     | Green (good)               |
            | 0.11 – 0.25s | Orange (needs improvement) |
            | Over 0.25s   | Red (poor)                 |

    -   Features
        -   Secure, *end-to-end encrypted* (SSL, TLS) access to dashboards.
        -   Secure *authentication* through E-mail and Single-Sign-On (SSO).
        -   Horizontal *scalability* of dashboards according to usage, fail-safe.
        -   Easy adaptability by analysts through automation and *continuous integration* (CI/CD).
        -   *Easy maintenance* and extensibility for system operators.
    -   Components
        -   **Application Load Balancer** (ALB) to handle secure end-to-end (SSL) encrypted access to the dashboards based on different host names (host-based-routing).
        -   **AWS Cognito** for user authentication based on E-mail and SSO through Ping Federate.
        -   **AWS Fargate** for horizontal scalability, fail-safe operations and easy maintenance.
        -   **AWS Codepipeline** and Codebuild for automated build of dashboard Docker containers.
        -   Extensive usage of managed services requiring low maintenance (Fargate, Cognito, ALB) and **Amazon Cloud Development Kit** (CDK) to define and manage infrastructure-as-code managed in Git and deployed via Code Pipelines.

### [{backendlessr}]{style="color: #990000"} {#sec-shiny-prod-sec-backend .unnumbered}

-   `remotes::install_gitlab("rresults/backendlessr")`
-   Provides user registration, login, logout, profiles
    -   Some small amounts of data can be sent to backendless (not log files)
        -   There are some user counting functions in the package for keeping track of API calls (I think)
-   API wrapper for backendless platform
-   Free for up to 60 API calls per minute 1M API calls per month
    -   If you need more, use invite code p6tvk3 when you create a new app to get 25% off for the first 6 months
-   Demo login: `backendlessr::shiny_demo_login` (http://0.0.0.0:3838)\
    ![](./_resources/Shiny,_Production.resources/Screenshot%20(521).png){.lightbox width="232"}
    -   Clicking the "Register" button calls the backendless API
    -   Displays "Successful" if user registration worked
-   Steps
    -   Register at backendless and get a free account

    -   Register you app\
        ![](./_resources/Shiny,_Production.resources/Screenshot%20(523).png){.lightbox width="332"}

        -   Get the Application ID and API key

    -   Add ID and key to .Renviron (for testing)

        ```         
        BACKENDLESS_APPID = "<app id>"
        BACKENDLESS_KEY = "<api_key>"
        ```

    -   Add ID and key to Docker Swarm secrets (for production)

    -   Install package and run functions in your shiny app

        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}Basic

            ``` r
            ui <- 
              fluidPage(
                titlePanel("User access demo"),
                actionLink("open login", "Log in"),
                hidden(actionLink("logout", "Log out")),
                hidden(moduleLoginUserUI("loginmain")),
                hidden(plotOutput("demoPlot", height = "300px"))
                #...
            )

            server <- 
              function(input, output, session) {
                # ...
                ObserveEvent(
                  input$open_login,
                  {showElement("loginmain-login-form")}
                  #...
                )
              }
            ```

            -   App listens for `actionLink` [open_login]{.var-text} which is the user login into the app
            -   Then `showElement` unhides all the hidden things in the ui (e.g. [logout]{.var-text}, [loginmain]{.var-text} module, [demoPlot]{.var-text}) and `actionLink` [Log in]{.var-text} becomes hidden (I think)
-   Bunch of user credential functions available but here's a list that currently aren't:
    -   Social Network logins (e.g. to allow a user to use their Facebook account to log in to our service);
    -   Async calls;
    -   Geolocation;
    -   Logging (send log messages of your app to Backendless platform).
    -   Enhanced Security
    -   User password reset
