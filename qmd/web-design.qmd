-   Using "Brand" to help choose font, palette, and imagery
    -   Notes from Erik Kennedy [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOQJO_V7sew&ab_channel=LearnUIDesign)
    -   Brand is just adjectives to describe your business, organization, etc.
        -   e.g. Trustworthy, Geeky, Casual, Precise, Fun, Technical, etc.
    -   Common Brands\
        ![](_resources/Web-Design.resources/brands-fonts-palettes-imgs-1.png){.lightbox group="brand" width="532"}
        -   "Neat, modern", "Luxury, formal", etc. are more of what I'd consider brand adjectives
        -   "Clean & Simple","Fancy", "Techie", etc. are how I'd describe the sites that epitomize those brands, but they could also be brand descriptors
    -   Blending Brands\

        -   Shows names of company websites that most represent the brand/website types
        -   e.g. The Apple website is a blend of Techie and Fancy.
-   Websites should be under 14kb ([article](https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/))
    -   Most web servers TCP slow start algorithm starts by sending 10 TCP packets which works out to 14kb
-   404 pages
    -   Guidelines
        -   *be brief:* the message on the 404 page should be straightforward and easy to understand, informing the user that the page they were trying to access is not available.
        -   *be contrite*: the tone of the 404 page should be friendly and apologetic, acknowledging the user's inconvenience and expressing empathy.
        -   *be helpful*: provide links to other areas of the website or a search box that can help users find what they're looking for quickly and easily.
        -   *be informative*: include contact information, such as a feedback form, social media account, or email address to give users an alternative way to reach out to you for assistance.
        -   *be you*: incorporate your brand's visual identity, including logos and colors, to help reinforce brand recognition and create a cohesive user experience.
