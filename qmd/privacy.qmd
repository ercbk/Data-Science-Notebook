Tags

* Tag sensitive information in dataframes

```
names(df)
[1] "date" "first_name" "card_number" "payment"
# assign pii tags
attr(df, "pii") <- c("name", "ccn", "transaction")
```

* Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

* Tag dataframes with the names of regulations that are applicable

```
attr(df, "regs") <- c("CCPA", "GDPR", "GLBA")
```

* CCPA is the privacy regulation for California
* GDPR is the privacy regulation for the European Union
* GLBA is the financial regulation for the United States
	* Needed because df has credit card and financial information

* Saving objects as .rds files preserves tags
