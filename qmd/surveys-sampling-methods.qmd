## Terms {#sec-surv-sampmeth-terms .unnumbered}

-   In a survey setting,
    -   [**U**]{style="color: #009499"} denotes a finite population (i.e. \[**target population**) of [**N**]{style="color: #009499"} units
    -   A sample [**s**]{style="color: #009499"} of [**n**]{style="color: #009499"} units (n≤N) is taken from U
-   [**Design Weights**]{style="color: #009499"} - The average number of units in the population that each sampled unit represents. This weight is determined by the sampling method and is an important part of the estimation process.
-   [**Empirical Design -**]{style="color: #009499"} When the inclusion probabilities (see below) are unknown
    -   See Non-Probabilistic Sampling Methods
    -   [Examples]{.ribbon-highlight}
        -   [Quota Sampling]{.underline} - Units are selected so to reflect known structures for the population
        -   [Expert Sampling]{.underline} - Units are selected according to expert advice
        -   [Network Sampling]{.underline} - Existing sample units recruit future units from among their 'network'.
-   [**Estimator**]{style="color: #009499"} of the parameter, θ, is a function of sample observations
    -   Example: Sample Mean

        $$
        \hat{\theta} = \frac {\sum_{i \in S}y_i}{S} = \bar{y}_S
        $$

        -   Population mean of the study variable can be estimated by the mean value over the sample observations
-   [**Inclusion Probability**]{style="color: #009499"} - The probability for a unit to appear in the sample
-   [**Probabilistic Design**]{style="color: #009499"} - When every element in the population has a fixed, known-in-advance inclusion probabilities
-   [**Sampling Bias**]{style="color: #009499"} - The probability distribution in the collected dataset deviates from its true natural distribution one would actually observe in the wilderness.
-   [**Sampling Frame**]{style="color: #009499"} - An exhaustive list of all the individuals which comprise the target population (Also see [Surveys, Design \>\> Sources of Error](surveys-design.qmd#sec-surv-design-soe){style="color: green"} \>\> Coverage or Frame Error)\
    ![](./_resources/Surveys,_Sampling_Methods.resources/image.2.png)
-   [**Study Parameter**]{style="color: #009499"} (θ) - Linear parameter of the study variable, such as a mean, a total or a proportion, or a more complex one such as a ratio between two population means, a correlation or a regression coefficient, a quantile (e.g. median, quartile, quintile or decile) or an inequality measure such as the Gini or the Theil coefficient. (also see estimator)
-   [**Study Variable**]{style="color: #009499"} (y)
    -   [Quantitative]{.underline} - Numerical information (e.g. the total disposable income or the total food consumption)

## Probabilistic Sampling Methods {#sec-surv-sampmeth-probsamp .unnumbered}

### Simple Random Sampling (SRS) {#sec-surv-sampmeth-probsamp-srs .unnumbered}

-   A method of selecting *n* units out of *N* such that every sample *s* of size *n* has the same probability of selection

-   [Simple Inclusion Probability]{.underline} - the probability for a unit to appear in the sample

    $$
    \pi_i = \mbox{Pr}(i \in S) = \sum \limits_{i \in s \in S} \mbox{Pr}(S = s) = \frac {\binom{N-1}{n-1}}{\binom{N}{n}} = \frac {n}{N}
    $$

    -   $n$ is the size of sample, $s$, and $N$ is the target population size

-   [Double Inclusion Probability]{.underline} - the probability for 2 units to appear in the sample

    $$
    \pi_{ij} = \mbox{Pr}(i,j \in S) = \sum \limits_{i,j \in s \in S} \mbox{Pr}(S = s) = \frac {\binom{N-2}{n-2}}{\binom{N}{n}} = \frac {n}{N} \frac {n-1}{N-1}
    $$

    -   Where $i \neq j$
    -   $n$ is the size of sample, $s$, and $N$ is the target population size

-   [Without Replacement]{.underline} (most common)

    -   At the first extraction, each one of the population units will have an equal probability of selection, $1/N$.
    -   At the second extraction, the remaining N-1 units will have a selection probability equal to $1/(N-1)$. Etc.

-   [With Replacement]{.underline} - all the units of the population will have all the same probability of being selected $1/N$ Advantages:

    -   It's simple and doesn't use auxiliary information on the population
    -   The selection is random and, then, any unit is favoured
    -   The sample is representative Disadvantages:
    -   The choice of the element is completely random
    -   A complete list of the population units is necessary
    -   It's time and cost consuming

-   [Estimated Total of the study variable]{.underline}, $\hat{Y}$

    $$
    \hat{Y}_{SRS} = N \bar{y}
    $$

    -   Where $N$ is the target population size

-   [Estimated Mean of the study variable,]{.underline} $\bar{Y}$

    $$
    \hat{\bar{Y}}_{SRS} = \bar{y}
    $$

    -   Where $\bar{y}$ is the sample mean

-   [Variance for Estimated Total]{.underline}

    $$
    V(\hat{Y}_{SRS}) = N^2 (1-f) \frac {S^2_y}{n}
    $$

    -   $S^2_y$ is the dispersion of the study variable, $y$, over the population $U$

        $$
        S^2_y = \frac {1}{N-1} \sum_{i \in U} (y_i - \bar{Y})^2
        $$

    -   Sampling Rate or Sampling Fraction: $\mbox{f} = n/N$

    -   Finite Population Correction Factor: $1-\mbox{f}$

-   [Variance for Estimated Mean]{.underline}

    $$
    \hat{V}(\bar{y}) = (1-\mbox{f}) \frac {s^2_y}{n}
    $$

    -   Sample Dispersion

        $$
        s^2_y = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i \in s} (y_i - \bar{y})^2
        $$

-   [Estimated size of subpopulation]{.underline}, $A$

    $$
    \hat{N}_A = Np_A
    $$

    -   $p_A$ is the sample proportion of units from target subpopulation, $U_A$
        -   i.e. (I think) $n_A / N_A$
    -   [Examples]{.ribbon-highlight}: Subpopulations
        -   Total number of males or females in the population
        -   Total number of elderly people aged more than 65 in the population
        -   Total number of establishments having more than 50 employees in a certain geographical region or in a sector of activity.

-   [Variance of sample proportion of subpopulation]{.underline}, $A$

    $$
    \hat{V}(p_A) = \frac{p_A(1-p_A)}{n}
    $$

-   [Domain Parameter Estimation]{.underline}

    -   Refers to estimating population parameters for sub-populations of interest, called *domains*. For instance, one may wish to estimate the mean household disposable income broken down by personal characteristics such as age, gender or citizenship

        -   I think this is different from "Estimated size of subpopulation, A" (above) because we're estimating a study variable of subpopulation vs the size of the subpopulation

    -   [Estimated Total of the study variable]{.underline}

        $$
        \hat{Y}_D = \frac{N \cdot n_D}{n} \; \bar{y}_D
        $$

        -   $\bar{y}_D$ - The sample mean of study variable, $y$, within the domain, $D$

        -   $n_D$ - The total number of sample units from the sample $s$ which fall into domain, $D$

            -   Sample size $n_D$ is a random variable of mean $\bar{n}D = nP_D$ where $P_D = N_D / N$
                -   I guess this is a random variable because this is strictly SRS, so you aren't stratifying by $D$ when you sample the target population. Therefore, the number of samples from $D$ you happen to get will be random and have a distribution.

        -   Alternative: When the size of the domain, $N_D$, of $U_D$ is known

            -   $\hat{Y}_{D,\mbox{alt}} = N_D \cdot \bar{y}D$
            -   This formula has a provably (see ebook in [Misc](surveys-sampling-methods.qmd#sec-surv-sampmeth-misc){style="color: green"}) lower variance than the original formula

    -   [Variance for Estimated Total]{.underline}

        $$
        V(\hat{Y}_D) \approx N^2_D \left(\frac{1}{\bar{n}_D} - \frac{1}{N_D}\right)S^2_D \left(1 + \frac{1-P_D}{CV^2_D} \right)
        $$

        -   Where

            $$
            \begin{align}
            &S^2_D = \sum_{k \in U_D} \frac{(y_k - \bar{Y}_D)^2}{N_D - 1}\\
            &CV_D = \frac{S_D}{\bar{Y}_D}
            \end{align}
            $$

        -   Assumes the population sizes, $N$ and $N_D$, are "large enough."

        -   For the Alternative Estimated Total formula (see above)

            $$
            V(\hat{Y}_{D,alt}) \approx N^2_D \left(\frac{1}{\bar{n}_D} - \frac{1}{N_D} \right)S^2_D
            $$

            -   Assumes the sample size, $n_D$, is "large enough."
            -   A provably lower variance (see ebook in [Misc](surveys-sampling-methods.qmd#sec-surv-sampmeth-misc){style="color: green"})

### Unequal Probability Sampling {#sec-surv-sampmeth-probsamp-ups .unnumbered}

-   Different units in the population will have different probabilities of being included in a sample.

    -   Unlike SRS, where each unit has an equal probability of being included in the sample

-   Unequal probability sampling can result in estimators having higher precision than when simple random sampling or other equal probability designs are used.

    -   Emphasizes the importance of utilizing so-called "auxiliary" information as a way to boost sampling precision. (see πk below)

-   Horvitz-Thompson estimator (without replacement selection)

    -   Estimated Total, $\hat{Y}$, for the study variable

        $$
        \hat{Y}_{HT}= \sum_{k \in S} \frac{y_k}{\pi_k} = \sum_{k \in s} d_ky_k
        $$

    -   $d_k = 1/\pi_k$ is the design weight of unit, $k$, of sample, $s$

    -   $\pi_k$ is the inclusion probability for unit, $k$, of sample, $s$

        -   In practice, as the study variable $y$ is unknown, the inclusion probabilities should be taken proportional to an auxiliary variable $x$ assumed to have a linear relationship with $y: π \propto x$ (*probability proportional to size sampling*)
        -   An inclusion probability that is optimal with respect to one study variable may be far from optimal with other study variables. In case of multi-purpose surveys, this is a major problem which generally prevents from using unequal probability sampling.
            -   Alternatively, survey statisticians use stratification as we know it always make accuracy better no matter the study variable.

-   Hansen-Hurwitz estimator has been proposed in case of sampling with replacement.

### Cluster Sampling {#sec-surv-sampmeth-probsamp-clust .unnumbered}

-   Assumes population has natural clusters (e.g. family unit). Different from Stratified Sampling in that the clustering characteristic(s) is the same for all clusters (between cluster variation = 0) and the within cluster variation is heterogeneous (i.e. within cluster variation != 0).
    -   Example: Family units in NYC are chosen randomly chosen. The variation between family members is whats studied.
-   Advantages:
    -   it's efficient when the clusters constitute naturally formed subgroups, for which we don't possess the list of the population
    -   Studying clusters can be less expensive than simple random sampling.
-   Disadvantages:
    -   The conditions of the clusters aren't always respected. The clusters may contain similar elements.

### Stratified Sampling {#sec-surv-sampmeth-probsamp-strat .unnumbered}

![](./_resources/Experiments,_General.resources/0-J8zjvPFHFXLzz8S-.png){width="432"}

-   [Misc]{.underline}

    -   Notes from [Chapter 3 Stratification](https://bookdown.org/osierguillaume/mybook/stratification.html#total-mean-and-proportion-estimators)
    -   The population is classified into subpopulations, called **strata**, based on some categorical characteristics, such as age, gender, education
    -   Stratified sampling buckets *the population* into k strata (e.g., countries), and then the experiment random samples individuals from each stratum independently.
    -   Assumes between group variation *is* *not* 0 (i.e. heterogeneous) and within-group variation *is* 0 (i.e. homogeneous)
    -   Reasons for stratification
        -   Baseline for group A different from group B
        -   Reason to believe the effect for group A will be different from group B
    -   Advantages
        -   It can be more efficient than simple random sampling
        -   There is less risk of obtaining non-representative samples
    -   Disadvantages
        -   It needs the availability of auxiliary information on the population.
        -   There are strict conditions for the strata

-   [Estimated Total]{.underline}, $\hat{Y}$, for the study variable and the\
    [Estimated Mean]{.underline} of the study variable, $\bar{Y}$ (respectively)

    $$
    \begin{align}
    &\hat{Y}_\mbox{STSRS}=\sum_{h=1}^H N_h \bar{y}_h \\
    &\hat{\bar{Y}}_\mbox{STSRS} = \sum_{h=1}^H W_h \bar{y}_h
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   Assumes SRS within each strata
    -   $N$ is the population size
    -   $N_h$ is the population strata size for strata, $h$
    -   $W_h$ is the frequency weight where $W_h = N_h / N$
    -   $\bar{y}_h$ is the sample mean of strata, $h$

-   [Variance for Estimated Total]{.underline} (assuming SRS within strata)

    $$
    V(\hat{Y}_\mbox{STSRS}) = \sum_{h=1}^H N_h^2 (1-\mbox{f}_h)\frac{S_h^2}{n_h}
    $$

    -   $n_h$ is the sample size for stratum, $h$
    -   Stratum Sampling Fraction: $\mbox{f}_h = n_h / N_h = n/N$ (which is just $\mbox{f}$)
        -   Assumes $\mbox{f}_h$ is the same for each strata
    -   Stratum Dispersion: $S_h^2$ should be similar to the sample dispersion for SRS below, except the domain of the variables is within stratum, $h$ (e.g. $n → n_h,$ $ȳ → ȳ_h$, etc.)
        -   Sample Dispersion for SRS

            $$
            s_y^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i \in s} (y_i - \bar{y})^2
            $$

-   [Variance for Estimated Mean]{.underline} (assuming SRS within strata)

    $$
    V(\bar{Y}_\mbox{STSRS}) = (1 - \mbox{f}) \frac{s^2_h}{n_h}
    $$

    -   $n_h$ will be the same for all $h$, so it's constant in this case

    -   Sampling Fraction: $\mbox{f} = N / n$

        -   $n$ is the overall sample size

    -   Within-Stratum Dispersion

        $$
        S_w^2 = \sum_{h=1}^H W_hS_h^2
        $$

        -   $S^2_h$: See above
        -   $N$ is the population size and $N_h$ is the population strata size for strata, $h$
        -   $W_h$ is the frequency weight where $W_h = N_h / N$

-   [Design Weights]{.underline}: $d_i = N_h / n_h \;\;\forall \in s_h$

    -   For SRS, design weights are equal within each stratum
    -   $s_h$ is the set of samples within stratum, $h$

-   Stratum sample size allocation methods

    -   Let assume the overall sample size, $n$, has been fixed (generally out of budgetary considerations). We seek to determine which sample size, $n_h$, is to be drawn out of each stratum in order to achieve statistical optimality under cost considerations.

    -   [Equal Allocation]{.underline}

        -   $n^\mbox{eq}_h = n / H$
        -   $H$ is the number of strata
        -   Performs poorly when the dispersions, $S^2_h$, are different from one stratum to another

    -   [Proportional Allocation]{.underline}

        -   Consists of selecting samples in each stratum in proportion to the size, $N_h$, of the stratum population

        -   $n^\mbox{prop}_h = (n \cdot N_h) / N = n \cdot W_h$

        -   Variance

            $$
            \begin{align}
            V(\hat{\bar{Y}}_\mbox{prop}) &= (1-\mbox{f})\frac{S^2_w}{n} \\
            &=\frac{\sum_{h=1}^h W_h S^2_h}{n} - \frac{\sum_{h=1}^h W_h S^2_h}{N} 
            \end{align}
            $$

    -   [Optimal or Neyman Allocation]{.underline}

        -   Seeks to minimize the variance under the cost constraint

            $$
            \sum_{h=1}^H c_h n_h = C_0
            $$

            -   $C_0$ is the overall budget available and $c_h$ the average survey cost for an individual in stratum $h$.

        -   Strata Sample Size *with* Cost Constraint

            $$
            \forall h \;\; n_h^\mbox{opt} = \frac{N_hS_h}{\sqrt{c_h}} \frac{C_0}{\sum_{h=1}^H N_h S_h \sqrt{c_h}}
            $$

        -   Strata Sample Size *without* Cost Constraint

            $$
            n_h^\mbox{opt} = n \frac{N_hS_h}{\sum_{h=1}^H N_hS_h} 
            $$

        -   Variance

            $$
            V(\hat{\bar{Y}}_\mbox{SRS}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_h W_h(\bar{Y}_h - \bar{Y})^2 - \frac{1}{n}\sum_h W_h(S_h - \bar{S})^2
            $$

            -   $\bar{S}$ must be the mean *sqrt* dispersion across all stratum

        -   Contrary to proportional allocation, the Neyman allocation is variable-specific: optimality is defined with respect to one study variable, and what is optimal with respect to one variable may be far from optimal with respect to another.

        -   The gain in accuracy as compared to proportional allocation is pretty small. That's why in practice proportional allocation is often preferred to optimal allocation.

    -   [Balanced Allocation]{.underline}

        $$
        \forall h \;\; n_h^\mbox{bal} = \frac{\tilde{n}}{H} + (n - \tilde{n})W_h
        $$

        -   $\tilde{n}$ is a subsample of $n$ that is *equally allocated* (see above) among the strata which insures minimal precision within the strata (i.e. locally)
        -   The rest of the sample ($n-\tilde{n}$) can be allocated using either *proportional* or *optimal allocations* (see above) in order to optimize accuracy for the overall sample (i.e. globally)
        -   Both proportional and Neyman allocations increase sample accuracy at global level, but may happen to perform very poorly when it comes to strata (e.g. regional) level estimates.

### Multi-Stage Sampling {#sec-surv-sampmeth-probsamp-mss .unnumbered}

-   [Misc]{.underline}
    -   Useful when no sampling frame is available
    -   Stages
        -   At first-stage sampling, a sample of *Primary Sampling Units* (PSU) is selected using a probabilistic design (e.g. simple random sampling or other, with or without stratification)
        -   At second-stage sampling, a sub-sample of *Secondary Sampling Units* (SSU) is selected within each PSU selected at first-stage. The selection of SSU is supposed to be independent from one PSU to another.
        -   At third-stage sampling a sample of Tertiary Sampling Units can be selected with each of the SSU selected at second stage.
        -   etc.
    -   Example: (given an absence of any frame of individuals)
        -   Select a sample of municipalities (first-stage sampling),
        -   Select a sample of neighbourhoods (second-stage sampling) within each selected municipality,
        -   Select a sample of households (third-stage sampling) within each of the neighbourhoods selected a second stage
        -   Select a sample of individuals (fourth-stage sampling) within each household.
    -   Advantages:
        -   Can be more efficient than using only 1 of the sampling strategies
        -   Can decrease sample size if there are numerous units within strata or clusters
    -   Disadvantages:
        -   If sampling assumptions aren't valid, multi-stage sampling results to be less efficient than simple random sampling.
-   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: 2-stage cluster sampling
    -   Adds a second stage to cluster sampling. After clusters are chosen, units within those clusters are randomly sampled.
-   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: 2-Stage Stratified Sampling
    -   Notes from [Two Stage Stratified Random Sampling --- Clearly Explained](https://towardsdatascience.com/two-stage-stratified-random-sampling-clearly-explained-59788b110a84)
    -   Useful for when you have hierarchical strata (e.g. towns/blocks and households)
    -   Example: An education study of students where:
        -   Schools (first stage sampling units) may be selected with probabilities proportional to school size
        -   Students (second stage units) within selected schools may be selected by stratified random sampling
    -   [Stage 1]{.underline}\
        ![](./_resources/Surveys,_Sampling_Methods.resources/1-PQ98HWvYvLevybvR_ctupw.png){width="632"}
        -   (Random?) Sample from group of First Stage Units (FSU)
            -   Each FSU usually has a population within a range
            -   e.g. census geographies (census block, metropolitan statistical area, etc.)
    -   [Stage 2]{.underline}\
        ![](./_resources/Surveys,_Sampling_Methods.resources/1-Z8y3BG0pOSrkewD01lLK4g.png){width="632"}
        -   All Second Stage Units (SSU) within each FSU are pooled together to create a population
            -   SSUs are the base geography unit you want to measure
            -   e.g. households
        -   Then each SSU is binned into Second Stage Strata (SSS) according to a characteristic or set of characteristics
            -   e.g. race, age, income level, education, etc.
            -   The SSS are stratified sampled

### Systematic Sampling {#sec-surv-sampmeth-probsamp-sys .unnumbered}

![](./_resources/Surveys,_Sampling_Methods.resources/1-K63QV6qlSwd3fz2yydd5Sw.png){width="432"}

-   Steps
    -   After choosing a sample size, n, calculate the sampling interval k = N/n, where N is the population size
        -   In the example, we have 9 smiles and we want to obtain a sample of 3 units, then N = 9, n = 3 and k = 9/3 =3.
    -   Select a random starting point, r, which is a random integer between 1 and k: 1≤r≤k.
        -   In the example, r = 2, where 1≤r≤3.
    -   Once the first unit is selected, we take every following k^th^ item to build the sample: r, r+k, r+2k , ... , r+(n-1)k.
-   Advantages:
    -   The random selection is applied only on the first item, while the rest of the items selected depend on the position of the first item and a fixed interval at which items are picked.
-   Disadvantages:
    -   If the list of the population elements presents a determined order, there is the risk of obtaining a non-representative sample

## Non-Probabilistic Sampling Methods {#sec-surv-sampmeth-probsamp-nonprob .unnumbered}

-   Misc
    -   Mostly used when probabilistic methods aren't possible due to rarity or difficulty in obtaining a representative sample of the population being studied or cost constraints of the experiment
-   [Quota Sampling]{.underline}
    -   Similar to Stratified Sampling (see Probabilistic Sampling Methods) except:
        -   Each stratum's sample size is called its **quota**
        -   Each stratum's sample size takes into account its distribution in the whole population.
            -   Example: If 80% of the population are males, then 80% of the sample should be males.
        -   Within each stratum's quota, the interviewer is free to choose the participants to interview.
            -   This seems to be the main difference
    -   Advantages:
        -   It's time and cost-effective, in particular with respect to the stratified sampling.
    -   Disadvantages:
        -   The results can be distorted due to the discretion of the interviewers or the non-response bias
        -   The quota sample can produce a selection bias
-   [Judgemental Sampling (aka Purposive Sampling)]{.underline}
    -   The researcher selects the participants because he believes they are representative of the population
        -   Useful when there is only a limited number of people with specific traits
    -   Advantages:
        -   It's time and cost-effective
        -   It's suitable to study a certain cultural domain, where the knowledge of an expert is needed
    -   Disadvantages:
        -   It can lead to a high selection bias the bigger is the gap between the researcher's knowledge and the actual situation of the population
-   [Convenience Sampling]{.underline}
    -   The researcher chooses anyone that is "convenient" to him, i.e. people that are immediately available to answer the questions, without any specific criteria
        -   Usually volunteers
    -   Advantages:
        -   It's very cheap and fast
    -   Disadvantages:
        -   It leads to a non-representative sample
-   [Snowball Sampling]{.underline}
    -   The researcher asks already recruited people to identify other potential participants, and so on
        -   Useful for rare populations, for which it's not possible to have the list of the population or it's difficult to locate the population.
            -   e.g. illegal immigrants
    -   Advantages:
        -   It's useful for market studies or researches about delicate topics.
    -   Disadvantages:
        -   The sample may be non-representative since it's not random, but depends on the people contacted directly or indirectly by the researcher
        -   It's time-consuming
