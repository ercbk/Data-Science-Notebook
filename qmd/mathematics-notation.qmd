# Mathematics, Notation




* ![](./_resources/Mathematics,_Notation.resources/unknown_filename.png)
	 means dot product; also covariance of x and y
	
* Z = X \\ Y
	* the set of random variables in set X that are not in set Y
* ![](./_resources/Mathematics,_Notation.resources/unknown_filename.1.png)
	 means x is orthogonal to y which means x is uncorrelated with y
	
* X is not independent of Y![](./_resources/Mathematics,_Notation.resources/ql_b610f9bb0614dc064c09e0854f572246_l3.png)
* _conditional independence_ : Y is not associated with some variable X, after conditioning on some other variable Z![](./_resources/Mathematics,_Notation.resources/ql_ef21391bca130a6e9d5b600964aa3b19_l3.png)
	* they are statements of which variables should be associated with one another (or not) in the data.
	* they are statements of which variables become dis-associated when we condition on some other set of variables.
	* There is no other path of influence from X to Y except through Z
* p(bi∣Ti,δi,yt; θ) or f(y|x; θ)
	* ";" acts as a grand comma to visually emphasize that x is of different kind (e.g. data vs parameters, random vs fixed quantities) than θ
		* i.e. separates data values from parameters to improve readability
* plim - probability limit![](./_resources/Mathematics,_Notation.resources/Screenshot (780).png)
	* Interpretations:
		* The value of the random variables gets close to a real number, x, in the sense that the probability that Xn is very different from x gets very small as n gets big.
		* The distribution of Xn gets very close to the distribution of some other random variable Y as n gets large (then we would need a definition for the distance between distributions).
