# Notation {#sec-math-not .unnumbered}

-   $\langle \boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol y \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^N x_iy_i = \boldsymbol x^T\boldsymbol y$

    -   Dot Product; Also covariance of x and y

-   $X \setminus Y$

    -   The set of random variables in set X that are not in set Y

-   $x \bot y$

    -   x is orthogonal to y which means x is uncorrelated with y

-   $x \not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp y$

    -   X is not independent of Y

-   $Y \perp\mkern-10mu\perp X\;|\;Z$

    -   Y is not associated with some variable X, after conditioning on some other variable Z

-   $[a, b] \mapsto \mathbb{R}$

    -   Says that $[a,b]$ gets "mapped" to the Reals.

-   $p\;(\;b_i \;∣\; y_t\;;\; \theta \;)$ or $f\;(\;y \;|\; x \;;\; \theta \;)$

    -   ";" acts as a grand comma to visually emphasize that x is of different kind (e.g. data vs parameters, random vs fixed quantities) than θ
        -   i.e. Separates data values from parameters to improve readability

-   $\text{plim}$

    -   Probability Limit\

        -   Interpretations:
            -   The value of the random variables gets close to a real number, x, in the sense that the probability that Xn is very different from x gets very small as n gets big.
            -   The distribution of Xn gets very close to the distribution of some other random variable Y as n gets large (then we would need a definition for the distance between distributions).
