### Misc {#sec-reg-spat-econ-misc .unnumbered}

-   The spatial lag is usually taken as the mean of the values of the variable at neighbouring observations for row-standardised spatial weights, or the sum for binary spatial weights.
-   Relatively dense spatial weights matrices may down-weight model estimates, suggesting that sparser weights are preferable
-   The presence of residual spatial autocorrelation need not bias the estimates of variance of regression coefficients, provided that the covariates themselves do not exhibit spatial autocorrelation
    -   if covariates and the residual are autocorrelated, it is likely that the estimates of variance of regression coefficients will be biased downwards if attempts are not made to model the spatial processes.
-   Recommended to start from the General Nested Model (GNM) and eliminate unneeded terms
-   Common use of pre-test strategies for model selection probably ought to be replaced by the estimation of the most general model appropriate for the relationships being modelled.
-   All covariates should NOT be added in spatially lagged form
-   If the processes in the covariates and the response match, we should find little difference between the coefficients of a least squares and a SEM, but very often they diverge, suggesting that a Hausman test for this condition should be employed.

### Models {#sec-reg-spat-econ-mod .unnumbered}

-   [[{spatialreg}]{.underline}]{style="color: #990000"} [Model Functions]{.underline}\

    | model | model name | maximum likelihood estimation function |
    |------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
    | SEM | spatial error | `errorsarlm(..., Durbin=FALSE)` |
    | SEM | spatial error | `spautolm(..., family="SAR")` |
    | SDEM | spatial Durbin error | `errorsarlm(..., Durbin=TRUE)` |
    | SLM | spatial lag | `lagsarlm(..., Durbin=FALSE)` |
    | SDM | spatial Durbin | `lagsarlm(..., Durbin=TRUE)` |
    | SAC | spatial autoregressive combined | `sacsarlm(..., Durbin=FALSE)` |
    | GNM | general nested | `sacsarlm(..., Durbin=TRUE)` |

-   **Spatial Lag Model (SLM)** or **Spatial Autoregressive (SAR)**\
    $$
    y = \rho_{\text{lag}}Wy + X\beta + \epsilon
    $$

    -   Includes a spatial process for the response
    -   $y$ : A $n\times 1$ vector of observations on a response variable taken at each of $n$ locations
    -   $\rho_{\text{lag}}$ : Scalar spatial parameter
    -   $W$ : A $n\times n$ spatial weights matrix
    -   $X$ : A $n\times k$ matrix of covariates usually including the intercept
    -   $\beta$ : A $k\times 1$ vector of parameters
    -   $\epsilon$ : A $n\times 1$ vector of iid *disturbances*

-   **Spatial Error Model (SEM)**\
    $$
    \begin{align}
    &y = X\beta + u \\
    &\text{where} \;\; u = \rho_{\text{err}} Wu + \epsilon
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   Includes a spatial process for the residuals
    -   $u$ : A $n\;\times\;1$ spatially autocorrelated disturbance vector
    -   $\rho_{\text{err}}$ : A scalar spatial parameter.

-   **Spatial Durbin Model (SDM)**\
    $$
    y = \rho_{\text{lag}}Wy + X\beta + WX\gamma + \epsilon
    $$

    -   Includes spatial processes for the response and covariates
    -   $WX$ : Is the spatially weighted, lagged covariates term
    -   $\gamma$ : A $k\;' \times 1$ vector of parameters where often $k' = k - 1$ when using row-standardized spatial weights and ommitting the spatially lagged intercept.
    -   The indirect spillover eﬀect produced by the SDM model is both local and global with no prior restrictions on the magnitudes of these eﬀects
    -   The exogenous regressor of one location casts an eﬀect on the dependent variable of the neighboring locations through *feedback loops*.
        -   The feedback loops are a result of the Durbin term due to which a location, say $i$ aﬀects aneighboring location, say $j$, which eventually has a consequence on $i, j = 1,2, \ldots , n$
    -   An advantage of the spatial Durbin model is that it produces correct standard errors or t−values of the coeﬃcient estimates also if the true data generating process is a spatial error model
    -   The SDM model reduces to SEM under a non-linear common factor restriction. Thus, theoretically speaking, the choice between SDM and SEM can be settled by performing astatistical test for the common factor restriction.
    -   Rao’s score test principle which is asymptotically equivalent to the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) but computationally much simpler
        -   Use of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is not attractive for testing a non-linear hypothesis, since LRT requires maximum likelihood estimation both under the null and the alternative hypotheses.

-   **General Nested Model (GNM)** or **General Nested Spatial Model (GNS)**

    $$
    \begin{align}
    &y = \rho_{\text{lag}}Wy + X\beta + WX\gamma + u \\
    &\text{where} \;\; u = \rho_{\text{err}} Wu + \epsilon
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   Includes a spatial process to the response, covariates, and residuals (kitchen sink model)
    -   Issue: The GNS is only weakly (or not?) identifiable
        -   Analogous to Manski’s reflection problem on neighborhood effects: If people in the same group behave similar, this can be because
            -   Imitating behavior of the group
            -   Exogenous characteristics of the group influence the behaviour
            -   Members of the same group are exposed to the same external circumstances. 
        -   We just cannot separate those in observational data.

-   **Combined Spatial Autocorrelation (SAC)**

    $$
    \begin{align}
    &y = \rho_{\text{lag}}Wy + X\beta + u \\
    &\text{where} \;\; u = \rho_{\text{err}} Wu + \epsilon
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   No spatial process for covariates
    -   AKA **Spatial AutoRegressive-AutoRegressive (SARAR)**

-   **Spatially Lagged X Model (SLX)**

    $$
    y = X\beta + WX\gamma + \epsilon
    $$

    -   Only has a spatial process for the covariates

-   **Error Durbin model (SDEM)**

    $$
    \begin{align}
    &y = X\beta + WX\gamma + u \\
    &\text{where} \;\; u = \rho_{\text{err}} Wu + \epsilon
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   No spatial process for the response

### Impacts {#sec-reg-spat-econ-imp .unnumbered}

-   Notes from
    -   [SDS Ch.17.3](https://r-spatial.org/book/17-Econometrics.html#impacts)
    -   [Geodata and Spatial Regression Ch.10](https://ruettenauer.github.io/Geodata_Spatial_Regression/07_impacts.html)
-   A model will have either local direct, indirect, and total impacts or global direct, indirect, and total impacts.
-   [Types]{.underline}
    -   [**Direct impacts**]{style="color: #009499"} measure the effect of changing an explanatory variable in a specific location on the dependent variable in that same location. This is analogous to traditional regression coefficients but accounts for spatial **feedback effects** when lagged endogenous variables are present (i.e. lagged response).
        -   Note that all variation in the impacts matrix comes from the variation in the spatial weights matrix which we've specified a priori.
            -   i.e. it's sort of subjective since we choose the neighboring scheme, weighting method, and normalization method. $W$ is not directly estimated from the data.
            -   I guess we could treat those choices as hyperparameters though.
        -   For a GNM,\
            $$
            S_r(W) = ((I - \rho_{\text{lag}}W)^{-1}(I\beta_r + W\gamma_r)
            $$
            -   $S_r(W)$ (the partial derivative) expresses the **direct impacts** (effects) on its principal diagonal, and **indirect impacts** in off-diagonal elements.
        -   For SAR,\
            $$
            S_r(W) = (I - \rho_{\text{lag}}W)^{-1}
            $$
        -   For SLX, SDEM,
            -   $\beta_k$ is the average (local) direct impact (covariate coefficient) and $\gamma_k$ is the average (local) indirect impact (lagged covariate parameter)
    -   [**Indirect impacts**]{style="color: #009499"} (aka [**spillover effects**]{style="color: #009499"}) capture how changing an explanatory variable in one location affects the dependent variable in neighboring locations through spatial interdependencies. These effects propagate through the spatial weights matrix.
    -   [**Total impacts**]{style="color: #009499"} are simply the sum of direct and indirect impacts, representing the overall effect of changing a variable across the entire spatial system.
    -   [**Global impacts**]{style="color: #009499"} provide system-wide average measures of direct, indirect, and total effects. Effects spread to all neighbors (i.e. includes higher order neighbors) but decrease with distance. Global spillover effects can be seen as a kind of diffusion process.
        -   Seen as crucial for reporting results from fitting models including the spatially lagged response (**SLM**, **SDM**, **SAC**, **GNM**) which assume global dependence, and has been extended to models with spatially lagged covariates (SLX, SDEM).
        -   Issue: These processes happen over time. In a cross-sectional framework, the global spillover effects are hard to interpret. Anselin (2003) proposes an interpretation as an equilibrium outcome, where the partial impact represents an estimate of how this long-run equilibrium would change due to a change in $x_k$.
        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: A public railway is built (exogenous effect) and connects the business district to other key areas in the city
            -   The new transit station drastically increases the desirability of District A. This surge in desirability leads to a sharp increase in demand for housing in District A.
                -   Because housing supply is fixed in the short term (you can't instantly build new houses), this increased demand results in a significant increase in house prices in District A.
            -   Potential homebuyers who were priced out of District A will now look for the next best alternative. District B, which is adjacent to District A and might have similar housing stock but without the direct train access, suddenly becomes a more attractive option by comparison. These buyers bring their increased willingness-to-pay with them.
            -   This effect continues to higher order neighbors, but weakens the further the district is from a railway station.
    -   [**Local impacts**]{style="color: #009499"} allow these effects to *vary* across different locations. This is particularly relevant in weighted spatial regression and other spatially varying coefficient models, where the relationship between variables can differ across space due to local conditions, policies, or characteristics.
        -   In Spatial Lag of X (**SLX**) model or the Spatial Durbin Error Model (**SDEM**), the influence of a change in an explanatory variable is restricted to a defined neighborhood of the initial location.
            -   These models assume local dependence. The impact does not propagate endlessly throughout the system. This more contained spillover is referred to as a local impact.
        -   Only direct neighbors – as defined in $W$ – contribute to local spillover effects. The coefficients only estimate how my direct neighbour’s $X$ values influence my own outcome $Y$.
            -   There are no higher order neighbors involved (as long as we do not model them), nor are there any feedback loops due to interdependence.
        -   Local impacts may be reported for SDEM and SLX models, using a linear combination to calculate standard errors for the total impacts of each covariate (sums of coefficients on the covariates and their spatial lags)
        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: The effect of environmental quality on house prices
            -   The environmental quality in the focal unit itself but also in neighbouring units could influence the attractiveness of a district and its house prices.
            -   Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that we have local spillover effects: only the environmental quality in directly contiguous units (e.g. in walking distance) is relevant for estimating the house prices.
    -   [**Feedback Effects**]{style="color: #009499"} are where the initial change in a location influences neighboring locations, which in turn influence the original location back.
        -   My $X$ influences my $Y$ directly, but my $Y$ then influences my neigbour’s $Y$, which then influences my $Y$ again (also also other neighbour’s $Y$s). Thus the influence of my $X$ on my $Y$ includes a spatial multiplier
-   [Interpretation]{.underline}
    -   **Direct Impacts** represent the average change in the dependent variable at location $i$ from a one-unit change in the explanatory variable at location $i$.
        -   An average effect of a unit change in $x_i$ on $y_i$
        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: If the direct impact of [police spending]{.var-text} (in \$1000s) is [0.15]{.arg-text} for [crime]{.var-text} reduction, then a \$1,000 increase in [police spending]{.var-text} in a [city]{.var-text} *reduces* [crime]{.var-text} in that same [city]{.var-text} by [0.15]{.arg-text} units on average.
    -   **Indirect Impacts** represent the average change in the dependent variable at location $i$ from a one-unit change in the explanatory variable at all other locations $j \ne i$.
        -   How a change in $x_i$, on average, influences all neighboring units $y_j$ .
        -   For global models: A change of $x_i$ in the focal units flows through the entire system of neighbors (direct neightbors, neighbors of neighbours, …) influencing ‘their ’ $y_j$. One can think of this as diffusion or a change in a long-term equilibrium.
            -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: If logNO2 increases by one unit, this increases the house price in the focal unit by 0.448 units. Overall, a one unit change in logNO2 increases the house prices in the entire neighborhood system (direct and higher order neighbours) by 0.754.
            -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: If the indirect impact is [0.08]{.arg-text}, then a $\$1,000$ increase in [police spending]{.var-text} in city $i$ r*educes* [crime]{.var-text} in all other cities by [0.08]{.arg-text} units on average through **spillover effects**.
        -   Remember it's the *average*. The effect on location $i$ from each other location will vary according to spatial relationships encoded in the spatial weights matrix.
        -   A change in city $j$ can affect city $i$ both directly (if they're neighbors) and indirectly through intermediate cities in the spatial network (i.e. the effect generated in other cities spilling over into a city).
        -   For SLX models, nothing is gained from computing the "impacts," as they equal the coefficients. Again, it’s the effects of direct neighbours only (i.e. a local indirect impact).
    -   **Total Impacts** represent the overall effect of a change in an explanatory variable across all locations in the study area. In essence, it captures the entire spatial multiplier effect

        -   Alternative to other methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo because of its speed and ease of use via the R-INLA package.
        -   Although the INLA methodology focuses on models that can be expressed as latent Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF), this encompasses a large family of models that are used in practice.
    -   glmmTMB uses functions of the distance between observations, and fitted variograms to model the spatial autocorrelation present (haven't found an example using this package)

    &Y = X \beta + Zu \\
    &\text{where} \;\; u \sim\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_u \; \Sigma)
    \end{align}
    $$
    -   $\sigma^2_u \; \Sigma$ is the variance/covariance matrix of the random effects
-   Random Effects ($u$) Formulas
    -   SAR: $\Sigma^{-1} = (I-\rho W)'\;(I-\rho W)$
        -   $W$ is a non-singular spatial weights matrix
        -   $\rho$ is a spatial correlation parameter
    -   CAR: $\Sigma^{-1} = (I-\rho W)$
        -   $W$ is a symmetric and strictly positive definite spatial weights matrix
    -   ICAR: $\Sigma^-1 = M = \text{diag}(n_i) - W$
        -   $W$ is a symmetric and strictly positive definite spatial weights matrix
    -   Leroux: $\Sigma^{-1} = (I-\rho)I_n + \rho M)$

        -   The lower level (census tract) dataset (no aggregation of variables) is used in these models while the neighbor's list/spatial weights object used is created from a higher level geometry ([NOX_ID]{.var-text}) (i.e. the spatial relationship is modeled at the higher level)
        -   Care is needed to match the indexing variable with the spatial weights. The neighbor's list object ([nb_q_93]{.var-text}) needs to get manipulated in some way in all these models in order for the spatial weights object to be in a suitable format for the particular model to accept.
