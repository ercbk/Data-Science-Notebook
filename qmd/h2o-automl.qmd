# h2o automl

## Misc

-   The amount of ram needed on local machine equals four to five times the size of your data (usually) but really depends on max number of models to be trained.

-   Diagnostic metrics used in classification models are AUC, log loss, and mean per class error

-   Seems to use generic variable importance (mean decrease gini)

-   I think a glm was used to ensemble its models

-   In the binary classification example, the top models were "extremely randomized trees", xgboost, and gbm.

-   Ensemble model reproducibility requires arguments: set seed and exclude_model = "DNN"  (deep neural network)

-   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: CV with LIME Explainer
