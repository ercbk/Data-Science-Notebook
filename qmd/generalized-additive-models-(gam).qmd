## Splines  {#sec-gam-spl}

-   Knots are placed at several places within the data range with (usually) low-order polynomials are chosen to fit the data between two consecutive knots.
    -   Choices
        -   Number of knots
        -   Their positions
        -   Degree of polynomial to be used between the knots (a straight line is a polynomial of degree 1)
    -   The type of polynomial and the number and placement of knots is what defines the type of spline.
        -   e.g. cubic splines are created by using a cubic polynomial in an interval between two successive knots.
    -   Increasing the number of knots may overfit the data and increase the variance, whilst decreasing the number of knots may result in a rigid and restrictive function that has more bias.

    -   Package Comparison
        -   Default types: [{mgcv}]{style="color: #990000"} uses thin plate splines (see smoothing splines) as a default for it's `s()` which makes it's spline more flexible (i.e. curvy) than the default splines for {gam}, {VGAM}, and [{gamlss}]{style="color: #990000"} which use cubic smoothing splines.
            -   [{gamlss}]{style="color: #990000"} doesn't use `s` but instead has specific functions for specific types of splines
        -   P-Splines: [{mgcv}]{style="color: #990000"} and [{gamlss}]{style="color: #990000"} are very similar, and the differences can be attributed to the different way that two packages optimize the penalty weight, λ.
            -   [{mgcv}]{style="color: #990000"}: option, "ps" within `s` will create a cubic p-spline basis on a default of 10 knots, with a third order difference penalty.
                -   The penalty weight, λ, is optimized with generalized cross validation.
            -   [{gamlss}]{style="color: #990000"}: `pb` defines cubic p-splines functions with 20 interior knots and a second order difference penalty.
                -   The smoothing parameter is estimated using local maximum likelihood method, but there are also other options based on likelihood methods, AIC, generalized cross validation and more.
                -   Multiple other functions available for p-splines with various attributes.
        -   Dependencies: [{mgcv}]{style="color: #990000"} creates its own spline functions while {gam}, {VGAM}, and [{gamlss}]{style="color: #990000"} use the base R package, {splines}.
            -   {gam} and {VGAM} call the base R function `smooth.spline` (smoothing spline) with four degrees of freedom as default and give identical results
    -   Terms
        -   **Smoothly Joined** -  means that for polynomials of degree n, both the spline function and its first n-1 derivatives are continuous at the knots.
-   Common variables: trend, calendar features, age, cardinal directions (N, S, E, W, etc.)
-   Tuning Parameters
    -   B: basis functions (e.g. B-Spline)
    -   d: the degree of the underlying polynomials in the basis
        -   Typically d = 3 (cubic) is used (\>3 usuallly indistinguishable)
    -   K: Number of knots for Regression Splines
        -   Usually k = 3, 4, 5. Often k = 4
            -   Harrell (uses natural splines): "For many datasets, k = 4 offers an adequate fit of the model and is a good compromise between flexibility and loss of precision caused by overfitting"
                -   If the sample size is small, three knots should be used in order to have enough observations in between the knots to be able to fit each polynomial.
                -   If the sample size is large and if there is reason to believe that the relationship being studied changes quickly, more than five knots can be used.
        -   Flexibility of fit vs. n and variance
            -   Large n (e.g. n ≥ 100): k = 5
            -   Small n (e.g. n \< 30): k = 3
        -   Can use Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to choose k
            -   This chooses k to maximize model likelihood ratio of χ2 − 2k.
        -   Also option for knot positions
            -   Locations not important in most situations
            -   Place knots where data exist e.g. fixed quantiles of predictor's marginal distribution (see B-Splines for examples)
                -   From Harrell's RMS![](./_resources/Generalized_Additive_Models_(GAM).resources/Screenshot%20(1370).png)
    -   λ: penalty weight for Smoothing Splines
        -   Calculated by generalized cross-validation in [{mgcv}]{style="color: #990000"} which is an approximation of LOO-CV
            -   see [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-form-of-cross-validation-should-you-use-76aaecc45c75) or Wood's GAM book or Elements of Statistical Learning (\~pg 244) for details
-   Regression Splines
    -   No penalty function added
        -   splined variable is just added to the regression model like any other predictor
    -   Types
        -   Truncated Power Basis
            -   Issue: Basis functions are not supported locally but over the whole range of the data
                -   Could lead to high correlations between some basis splines, implying numerical instabilities in spline estimation
            -   Example: d = 3 (cubic) with 5 equidistant knots![](./_resources/Generalized_Additive_Models_(GAM).resources/image.png)
            -   Example: d = 3 with 3 knots (τ1, τ2, τ3)![](./_resources/Generalized_Additive_Models_(GAM).resources/Screenshot%20(994).png)
                -   7 dof
        -   B-splines![](./_resources/Generalized_Additive_Models_(GAM).resources/image.1.png)
            -   based on a special parameterization of a cubic spline
            -   See [Statistical Rethinking](Statistical%20Rethinking) \>\> (end of ) Ch 4
            -   Basis functions supported locally which leads to high numerical stability, and also in an efficient algorithm for the construction of the basis functions.
            -   Issue: can be erratic at the boundaries of the data (boundary knots)
            -   Degrees of freedom (dof) = d + K
            -   `bs(x)` will create a cubic B-spline basis with two boundary knots and one interior knot placed at the median of the observed data values
                -   Bounded by the range of the data
                -   `lm(y ~ bs(x))`
            -   Example: `bs(x, degree=2, knots=c(0,.5,1))`
                -   degree specifies d
                -   knots specifies the number of knots and their locations
            -   Example: `bs(x, knots = median(x))`
                -   1 interior knot created at the median
                -   4 dof since d + K = 3 + 1
                    -   d = 3 (default)
            -   Example: `bs(x, knots = c(min(x), median(x), max(x)))`
                -   1 interior knot specified at the median and 2 boundary knots at the min and max.
                -   6 dof since d + K = 3 + 3
                    -   d = 3 (default)
        -   Natural cubic and cardinal splines![](./_resources/Generalized_Additive_Models_(GAM).resources/image.2.png)
            -   Stable at boundaries of data because of additional constraints that they are linear in the tails of the boundary knots
            -   Degrees of freedom (dof) = K + 1
            -   `ns(x)` returns a straight line within the boundary knots
                -   `lm(y ~ ns(x))`
            -   Example: `ns(x,df=3)`
                -   "df" specifies degrees of freedom
                -   "knots": alternatively to specifying df, you can specify the knots (# and positions) like in `bs`
            -   Cardinal splines
                -   Have an additional constraint that leads to the interpretation that each coefficient βk is equal to the value of the spline function at the knot τk
-   Smoothing splines (aka penalyzed splines)
    -   Automatically handles the number of knots and knot positions by using a large number of knots and letting *λ* control the amount of smoothness
        -   Different packages usually produce similar results. Penalties are very powerful in controlling the fit, given that enough knots are supplied into the function
    -   Requires modification of the fitting routine in order to accommodate it
        -   Probably need a GAM package to use.
    -   A special case of the more general class of thin plate splines
    -   Function![](./_resources/Generalized_Additive_Models_(GAM).resources/Screenshot%20(996).png)
        -   The maximization of this function implies a trade-off between smoothness and model fit that is controlled by the tuning parameter *λ*
        -   Terms
            -   lβ is the likelihood
            -   Jβ (penalty function) is the roughness penalty (expresses the smoothness of the spline function)
                -   For a gaussian regression this is the integrated second derivative of the spline function (see paper for more details)
                    -   Example: ![](./_resources/Generalized_Additive_Models_(GAM).resources/Screenshot%20(306).png)
            -   λ is a tuning parameter that's ≥0
    -   B-Spline basis is typically used
    -   Not easy to specify the degrees of freedom, since they will vary depending on the size of the penalty
        -   Usually can be restricted to a maximum number of degrees of freedom or desired degrees of freedom
    -   Penalized Regression Splines
        -   Approximation of a smoothing spline
        -   Best used when n is large and the variable range is covered densely by the observed data
        -   P-Spline
            -   Based on the cubic B-spline basis and on a 'large' set of equidistant knots (usually, 10--40)
            -   Simplifies the calculation of Jβ (see paper for more details)
            -   Packages: [{mgcv}]{style="color: #990000"}, [{gamlss}]{style="color: #990000"} (see above, Misc \>\> Package Comparison)
