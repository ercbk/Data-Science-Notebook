-   Large gaps in the values of the predictor variable can be a problem if you are trying to interpolate between those gaps. (See bkmks, `method = "reml" + s(x, m = 1)`)

    -   Sound similar to Partial Dependence Plots/Profiles except instead of the average response value on the Y-axis, it's the effect size.
    -   The Y-axis on these plots is typically centred around 0 due to most smooths having a sum-to-zero identifiability constraint applied to them
    -   Show link-scale predictions of the response for each smooth, conditional upon all other terms in the model, including any parametric effects (i.e. fixed effects) and the intercept, having zero contribution.
    -   These plots show adjusted predictions, just where the adjustment includes setting the contribution of all other model terms to the predicted value to zero

    -   Check if the size of the basis expansion (k) for each smooth is sufficiently large
        -   `k.check` can also do this
        -   If all your smoothing predictors are not sufficiently large, then this indicates that using a GAM is a bad fit for your data.

-   Formal test for the necessity of a smooth

    ``` r
    m <- 
      gam(y ~ x + s(x, m = c(2, 0), bs = "tp"),
          data = foo,
          method = "REML",
          family = binomial())
    ```

    -   `bs = "tp"` is just the default thin plate basis function
    -   Fit the predictor of interest as a linear term (x) plus a smooth function of x
    -   Modify the basis for the smooth so that it no longer includes linear functions in the span of the basis with [m = c(2, 0)]{.arg-text}
        -   [m]{.arg-text}: Controls the penalty on the wiggliness of spline
        -   [2]{.arg-text}: An order-2 penalty (the default and most common) penalizes the second derivative of the function, which relates to its curvature.
            -   Higher values would penalize higher-order derivatives, resulting in even smoother functions.
        -   [0]{.arg-text}: Specifies that no null space basis is required.
            -   The null space is the span of functions that aren't affected by the (main) penalty, because they have 0 second derivative. (i.e. terms that doen't have curvature)
            -   For an order-2 penalty, the null space typically includes constant and linear terms.
    -   `summary` will give a test for the necessity of the wiggliness provided by the smooth over the linear effect estimated by the linear term. Check the p-value of the smooth term. If it's significant, then a spline should be used. In your model, you wouldn't use the zeroed out null space specification though.
