    -   Check if the size of the basis expansion (k) for each smooth is sufficiently large
        -   `k.check` can also do this
        -   If all your smoothing predictors are not sufficiently large, then this indicates that using a GAM is a bad fit for your data.

-   Formal test for the necessity of a smooth

    ``` r
    m <- 
      gam(y ~ x + s(x, m = c(2, 0), bs = "tp"),
          data = foo,
          method = "REML",
          family = binomial())
    ```

    -   `bs = "tp"` is just the default thin plate basis function
    -   Fit the predictor of interest as a linear term (x) plus a smooth function of x
    -   Modify the basis for the smooth so that it no longer includes linear functions in the span of the basis with m = c(2, 0)
        -   Indicates we want the usual second order derivative penalty but with a 0 size null space (the span of functions that aren't affected by the penalty because they have 0 second derivative).
    -   `summary` will give a test for the necessity of the wiggliness provided by the smooth over the linear effect estimated by the linear term.\
