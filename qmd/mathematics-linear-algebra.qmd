# Linear Algebra

Resources

* See Matrix Cookbook pdf in R >> Documents >> Mathematics
	* derivatives, inverses, statistics, probability, etc.
* [Link](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/csc423/documents/matrix-form.htm) - A lot of matrix properties as related to regression, covariance, coefficients, etc.
* [EBOOK statistical linear algebra: basics, transformations, decompositions, linear systems, regression - Matrix Algebra for Educational Scientists](https://zief0002.github.io/matrix-algebra/index.html)

Matrix Algebra

* An expected value equation (VC stands for variance-covariance in example) multiplied by a matrix, C.![](./_resources/Linear_Algebra.resources/1-XO9-uivgoTrBx1l4JHRpGQ.png)
	* C is factored out of an expected value as C
	* C is factored out of a transpose as CT
