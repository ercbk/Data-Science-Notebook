        -   Recommends using String Similarity. Then use Embeddings on the remaining unmatched. Shows an 80% match. Can get about 90% by raising the similarity threshold, but it increases the amount of false positive matches.
    -   Exact Name Matching (e.g. by name variable
        -   Article example had a \~31% match rate
    -   String Similarity (e.g. address variable + Jaro-Winkler distance)
        -   Article example had a \~68% match rate
    -   Embeddings (e.g. embed name variable + cosine similarity)
        -   Article example had a \~71% match rated

## File Types {#sec-geo-proc-filtyp .unnumbered}

-   GeoPackage - Defined as a SQLite 3 database file with a specific database schema and with filename extension `.gpkg`. The schema defines data and metadata tables with specified definitions, integrity assertions, format limitations and content constraints ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoPackage))

    -   Designed to be as lightweight as possible and be contained in one ready-to-use single file. This makes it suitable for mobile applications in disconnected mode and rapid sharing on cloud storage, USB drives, etc.
    -   The GeoPackage extension F.3 RTree Spatial Indexes specifies how to use SQLite spatial indexes in order to speed up performance on spatial queries compared to traditional geospatial files formats.

-   [PMTiles](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles) - A single-file archive format for tiled data. A PMTiles archive can be hosted on a commodity storage platform such as S3, and enables low-cost, zero-maintenance map applications that are "serverless" - free of a custom tile backend or third party provider. ([Docs](https://docs.protomaps.com/)) ([Example](https://gist.github.com/walkerke/cf87df489be8065635cf9b0c0dee34f5) w/[{mapgl}]{style="color: #990000"})

    -   Run your interactive, smooth-zooming vector map from any storage like S3 that supports http requests; a Caddy server running on your Wi-Fi router, or even GitHub pages (if tiles \< 1GB).
    -   Cloudflare R2 is the recommended storage platform for PMTiles because it does not have bandwidth fees, only per-request fees: see [R2 Pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/platform/pricing/#r2-pricing).

-   Shape Files

    -   Read in only the attributes table using `foreign::read.dbf` if you don't need the geometries ([source](https://cmep-ms.github.io/blog/posts/2025-07-11_spatial_learning/))

    -   Read in the full spatial data and drop the geometry using `sf::st_drop_geometry` or `terra::values` ([source](https://cmep-ms.github.io/blog/posts/2025-07-11_spatial_learning/))

        -   These pull out the data frame, so if you assigned it to a different object you have to remove the spatial object

    -   Validate geometries when loading a shape file

        ``` r
        NY8_sf <- 
          st_read(system.file(
                    "shapes/NY8_bna_utm18.gpkg", 
                    package = "spData"), 
                  quiet = TRUE)
        # validate geometries
        table(st_is_valid(NY8_sf))
        #> TRUE 
        #>  281 
        ```

        -   If `st_is_valid` returns FALSE, then you can run `st_make_valid`

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Counties in California

        ``` r
        tbl <- 
          tigris::counties(state = "CA") %>%
          st_set_crs(4326)
        ```

    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[tigris](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} - US data

        ``` r
        library(tigris)

        us_states <- states(resolution = "20m", year = 2022, cb = TRUE)

        lower_48 <- us_states %>%
          filter(!(NAME %in% c("Alaska", "Hawaii", "Puerto Rico")))
        ```

    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[rnaturalearth](https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalearth){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} - World data

        ``` r
        # Via URL
        # Medium scale data, 1:50m Admin 0 - Countries
        # Download from https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/
        world_map <- read_sf("ne_50m_admin_0_countries/ne_50m_admin_0_countries.shp") %>%
          filter(iso_a3 != "ATA")  # Remove Antarctica

        # Via Package
        library(rnaturalearth)

        # rerturnclass = "sf" makes it so the resulting dataframe has the special
        # sf-enabled geometry column
        world_map <- ne_countries(scale = 50, returnclass = "sf") %>%
          filter(iso_a3 != "ATA")  # Remove Antarctica
        ```

-   GeoJSON

    -   Write data to geojson

        ``` r
        data %>%
            st_write("mb_shapes.geojson")
        ```

-   CSV to Dataframe ([source](https://fosstodon.org/@yabellini/113181640707981113))

    ``` r
    # points
    localidad <- 
      st_as_sf(localidad, 
               coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), 
               crs = 4326)

    # polygons
    departamentos <- 
      st_as_sf(departamentos, 
               wkt = "geomTDepartamento")
    ```

    -   [wkt]{.arg-text} is the column that holds WKT encoded geometries

-   Read only data within a bounding box

    -   Filtering during read can be much faster than "read then filter" if the file has a spatial index

    -   From a URL ([source](https://pmassicotte.github.io/r-spatial-cookbook/filtering.html#filtering-spatial-data-with-a-bounding-box))

        ``` r
        # URL to the wind turbine database
        url <- "/vsizip//vsicurl/https://ftp.cartes.canada.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/Wind-energy_Energie-eolienne/wind_turbines_database/wind_turbine_database_en.gdb.zip"

        # List layers in the dataset
        st_layers(url)

        # Read and transform the area of interest
        area_bdd <- read_sf(fs::path("data", "area.geojson")) |>
          st_transform(crs = st_crs(pts))

        # Convert the area geometry to WKT
        wkt_bdd <- area_bdd |>
          st_geometry() |>
          st_as_text()

        # Read the filtered dataset using the bounding box
        dat_bdd <- read_sf(url, wkt_filter = wkt_bdd)
        ```

        -   Also see [Databases, DuckDB \>\> Extensions](db-duckdb.html#sec-db-duckdb-ext){style="color: green"} \>\> Geospatial for an example of filter by bounding box through a DuckDB query

    -   From a file ([source](https://dewey.dunnington.ca/slides/rspatial2025/#/sf-for-bigger-data-filter-on-read))

        ``` r
        bounds_lonlat <- st_bbox(
          c(xmin = -64.6418, 
            xmax = -64.2868, 
            ymin = 44.8473, 
            ymax = 45.0151),
          crs = st_crs("OGC:CRS84")
        )

        # Read the CRS of the source
        elevation_crs <- st_layers("data/ns-water_elevation.fgb")$crs[[1]]

        # Transform the bounds to the CRS of the source
        bounds_poly <- bounds_lonlat |>
          st_transform(elevation_crs) |>
          st_as_sfc()

        # Read just the data you need
        elevation <- st_read(
          "data/ns-water_elevation.fgb",
          wkt_filter = st_as_text(bounds_poly)
        )
        ```

## Big Data {#sec-geo-proc-bd .unnumbered}

-   Misc

    -   If your computation takes in the 30 sec to a few minutes range, then use duckdb and its spatial extensions (See [Databases, DuckDB \>\> Geospatial](db-duckdb.qmd#sec-db-duckdb-geo){style="color: green"}, [Apache \>\> Arrow \>\> Misc](apache-arrow.qmd#sec-apache-arrow-misc){style="color: green"} \>\> [{geoarrow}]{style="color: #990000"})
    -   If your compution take closer to 10 to 20 minutes or more, then use Apache Sedona (See package in [Misc](geospatial-processing.qmd#sec-geo-proc-misc){style="color: green"})
        -   Sedona can do parallelized joins.
    -   geoparquet (vector) and COGS (raster) allow users to only download what they need and not the entire set of files.

-   Fast read

    ``` r
    library(vapour)
    library(geos)
    elevation <- vapour_read_geometry("data/ns-water_elevation.fgb") |>
      geos_read_wkb(crs = st_crs(lakes))
    ```

-   Use a SQL query to reduce the data read into memory ([source](https://pmassicotte.github.io/r-spatial-cookbook/chapters/filtering/01_filtering.html#refining-the-filter-with-a-user-defined-sql-query))

    -   With [{sf}]{style="color: #990000"} and with a bounding box

        ``` r
        high_capacity <- read_sf(
          url,
          wkt_filter = wkt_bdd,
          query = "SELECT * FROM wind_turbine WHERE Turbine_Rated_Capacity__kW_ > 4000"
        )
        ```

        -   [wind_turbine]{.var-text} is a layer discovered using `st_layers` in the previous example

    -   With [{terra}]{style="color: #990000"}

        ``` r
        f <- system.file("ex/lux.shp", package="terra")
        v <- vect(f)
        v
        #>  class       : SpatVector 
        #>  geometry    : polygons 
        #>  dimensions  : 12, 6  (geometries, attributes)
        #>  extent      : 5.74414, 6.528252, 49.44781, 50.18162  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
        #>  source      : lux.shp
        #>  coord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) 
        #>  names       :  ID_1   NAME_1  ID_2   NAME_2  AREA       POP
        #>  type        : <num>    <chr> <num>    <chr> <num>     <num>
        #>  values      :     1 Diekirch     1 Clervaux   312 1.808e+04
        #>                    1 Diekirch     2 Diekirch   218 3.254e+04
        #>                    1 Diekirch     3  Redange   259 1.866e+04
        v <- 
          vect(f, 
               query="SELECT NAME_1, NAME_2, ID_2 FROM lux WHERE ID_2 < 4")
        ```

-   Use lazy evaluation via [{terra}]{style="color: #990000"}

    -   As a SpatVectorProxy

        ``` r
        f <- system.file("ex/lux.shp", package="terra")
        v <- vect(f, proxy=TRUE)
        v
        #>  class       : SpatVectorProxy
        #>  geometry    : polygons 
        #>  dimensions  : 12, 6  (geometries, attributes)
        #>  extent      : 5.74414, 6.528252, 49.44781, 50.18162  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
        #>  source      : lux.shp
        #>  coord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) 
        #>  names       :  ID_1 NAME_1  ID_2 NAME_2  AREA   POP
        #>  type        : <num>  <chr> <num>  <chr> <num> <num>

        summary(v)     # reads only metadata
        v[1:5, ]       # reads just a few features

        x <- query(v, vars=c("ID_2", "NAME_2"), start=5, n=2)
        x
        #>  class       : SpatVector 
        #>  geometry    : polygons 
        #>  dimensions  : 2, 2  (geometries, attributes)
        #>  extent      : 5.74414, 6.528252, 49.72324, 50.03632  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
        #>  source      : lux.shp
        #>  coord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) 
        #>  names       :  ID_2     NAME_2
        #>  type        : <num>      <chr>
        #>  values      :     5      Wiltz
        #>                    6 Echternach
        ```

        -   Using [proxy = TRUE]{.arg-text}, allows you to reference a spatial vector dataset (like a shapefile or GeoPackage layer) **without actually reading all the data into memory**. This is especially useful when working with large datasets that don’t fit comfortably into RAM.

-   Reduce Size Via SQL Query

    -   Uses [OGR SQL](https://gdal.org/user/ogr_sql_dialect.html) (SQLite might also be accepted)

    -   Choose Layer

        ``` r
        library("sf")
        st_layers("data/Lower_layer_Super_Output_Areas_2021_EW_BGC_V3.gpkg")
        ## Driver: GPKG 
        ## Available layers:
        ##            layer_name geometry_type features fields crs_name
        ## 1 LSOA_2021_EW_BGC_V3 Multi Polygon    35672      7  OSGB36 / British National Grid         
        ```

        -   This file only has one layer

    -   Get an idea of the columns in the layer by looking at the first row.

        ``` r
        st_read("data/Lower_layer_Super_Output_Areas_2021_EW_BGC_V3.gpkg",
                query = "SELECT * FROM LSOA_2021_EW_BGC_V3 WHERE FID = 1",
                quiet = TRUE)

        ## Simple feature collection with 1 feature and 7 fields
        ## Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON
        ## Dimension:     XY
        ## Bounding box:  xmin: 531948.3 ymin: 181263.5 xmax: 532308.9 ymax: 182011.9
        ## Projected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid
        ##    LSOA21CD            LSOA21NM  BNG_E  BNG_N     LONG      LAT
        ## 1 E01000001 City of London 001A 532123 181632 -0.09714 51.51816
        ##                                 GlobalID                          SHAPE
        ## 1 {1A259A13-A525-4858-9CB0-E4952BA01AF6} MULTIPOLYGON (((532105.3 18...
        ```

        -   [FID = 1]{.arg-text} says look at the first row. FID is the feature ID attribute. I don't think it's actual column in the dataset.

    -   Query the layer and filter

        ``` r
        st_read("data/Lower_layer_Super_Output_Areas_2021_EW_BGC_V3.gpkg",
                query = "SELECT * FROM LSOA_2021_EW_BGC_V3 WHERE LSOA21CD LIKE 'W%'",
                quiet = TRUE)
        ```

        -   [W%]{.arg-text} says looks for values that start with "W" (Wales) in the [LSOA21CD]{.var-text} column
            -   Based on the OCR SQL docs I think `%` is wildcard for multiple characters.

-   Use a bounding box to filter overlapping geometries

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Filter polygons overlapping the boundaries of Wales

        -   Filter Wales from a UK shapefile dataset

            ``` r
            uk <- sf::st_read("data/Countries_December_2022_GB_BGC.gpkg")
            wales <- dplyr::filter(uk, CTRY22NM == "Wales")
            ```

        -   Create Wales polygon

            ``` r
            wales_wkt <-  
              wales |>
              sf::st_geometry() |>
              sf::st_as_text()
            ```

        -   Filter overlapping geometries

            ``` r
            wales_lsoa <- 
              sf::st_read("data/Lower_layer_Super_Output_Areas_2021_EW_BGC_V3.gpkg",
                          wkt_filter = wales_wkt)
            ```

            -   Some English LSOAs along the Wales/England border in addition to the Welsh LSOAs are read in, because these technically overlap with the Wales polygon on the border itself. Not perfect but still reduces the data being read into memory.

## Projections {#sec-geo-proc-proj .unnumbered}

### Misc {#sec-geo-proc-proj-misc .unnumbered}

-   Resources
    -   Google "epsg code" + "your region name" to find a reasonable projection code to use
    -   [Spatial Reference](https://spatialreference.org/)
        -   Search
            -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: [Polar](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/?search=polar) region
                -   [Ellis](https://freerangestats.info/blog/2024/08/24/polar-maps) used a combination of WGS 84 (south) and NSIDC (north).
        -   [Explorer](https://spatialreference.org/explorer.html)
            -   Click a place on the map, choose "projected" (other options available), choose ESPG (other options available), then a list of projections is the output
            -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Berlin\
                ![](_resources/Geospatial,_Processing.resources/spat-ref-1.png){.lightbox width="332"}
-   Formats
    -   **epsg:** The EPSG code (if available), a standardized code for coordinate systems.
    -   **proj4string:** A text string defining the projection parameters in PROJ.4 format.
    -   **wkt:** The Well-Known Text representation of the CRS.
-   OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) vs WGS (World Geodetic System)
    -   Both are same except for axis order
    -   WGS84 ([EPSG:4326]{.arg-text}) uses latitude/longitude order (y,x)
        -   Traditional axis order used by cartographers and geographers throughout history
    -   CRS84 ([OGC:CRS84]{.arg-text}) uses longitude/latitude order (x,y)
        -   Adopted since many mathematical and computational systems conventionally list x first, then y.
        -   Example: `st_transform(data, "OGC:CRS84")`
-   With data that's in an older coordinate system, transformation instructions to a more modern system might be included in the output (wkt text) of the `st_crs`
    -   SOURCECRS: Your actual current coordinate system (e.g. UTM Zone 18N with Clarke 1866 datum)
    -   TARGETCRS: The reference system you'll be in after the transformation (e.g. WGS84)
    -   ABRIDGEDTRANSFORMATION: Instructions for converting between the source and target systems

### Geographic Coordinates {#sec-geo-proc-geo .unnumbered}

-   AKA geodetic coordinates

-   Required for Great Distance and Spherical Distance calculations

-   WGS 84

    -   EPSG:[4326]{.arg-text}

    -   Most common for global datasets. Used by most web mapping services and GPS devices

    -   Required by leaflet

    -   Formats

        ``` r
        st_transform(data, "EPSG:4326")    # Most common
        st_transform(data, "WGS84")        # Also works
        st_transform(data, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")  # Seen in older code before epsg
        st_transform(data, 4326)           # epsg value
        ```

-   EPSG:4269 (NAD83):

    -   Official US standard: NAD83 is the official horizontal datum used by US federal agencies and most state/local governments for mapping and surveying within the continental United States.

    -   Specifically designed for North America and provides slightly better positional accuracy for the continental US than WGS84.

-   Convert dataframe with latitude and longitude to a sf object with geometries

    ``` r
    new_tbl <- old_tbl # contains latitude and longitude variables
        # convert to simple features object
        sf::st_as_sf(
            coords = c("<longitude_var>", "<latitude_var>"), # order matters
            crs = 4326
        ) %>%
        mapviw::mapview()

-   United States:

    -   States
        -   Each state also has its own State Plane coordinate system
        -   States also have zones that zoom into a particular region of the state. Each will have it's own EPSG.
            -   Alaska has 10 zones (most of any state)
            -   Texas has 5 zones
            -   California has 6 zones
            -   Florida has 3 zones
            -   Rhode Island has just 1 zone (like many smaller states)
        -   There also are separate projections for feet and meters
            -   Example: Hawaii Zone 3
                -   EPSG:6633, NAD83(PA11) / Hawaii zone 3 (feet)
                -   EPSG:6630, NAD83(PA11) / Hawaii zone 3 (meters)

    -   Continental/Contiguous US (CONUS), i.e. 48 states:
        -   Use EPSG:6350 as it is the most current and most accurate
        -   Timeline on the CONUS projections

            -   Only supported via proj string, `st_transform(crs = "+proj=gs48")`
    -   North American Terrestrial Reference Frame of 2022 (NATRF2022). These new datums will replace NAD83 and are expected to be released in 2025. Once these datums are adopted, new projections (e.g., Albers or UTM) will likely be defined for CONUS using the updated reference frames.

## Python {#sec-geo-proc-py .unnumbered}

-   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Filter Data based on a polygon using latitude and longitude data

    -   Get California's polygon

        ``` python
        import osmnx
        import geopandas as gpd

        place = "California, USA"
        gdf = osmnx.geocode_to_gdf(place)
        # Get the target geometry
        gdf = gdf[["geometry", "bbox_north", "bbox_south", "bbox_east", "bbox_west"]]
        ```

    -   Filter data according the polygon geometry

        ``` python
        from shapely.geometry import Point

        # Convert to a GeoDataFrame with Point geometry
        geometry = [Point(xy) for xy in zip(df['Longitude'], df['Latitude'])]
        earthquake_gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=geometry, crs='EPSG:4326')

        # Filter to keep only points within the California bounding box
        points_within_california = gpd.sjoin(earthquake_gdf, gdf, how='inner', predicate='within')

        # Select latitude, longitude etc. columns
        df = points_within_california[['id', 'Latitude', 'Longitude', 'datetime', 'properties.mag']]
        ```

        -   Latitude and longitude are converted to point geometry to match the polygon point geometry
        -   An inner join is used on the data and california polygon to get the points that are only in California.

## sf {#sec-geo-proc-sf .unnumbered}

### Misc {#sec-geo-proc-sf-misc .unnumbered}

-   [Docs](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), [tidyverse methods for sf objects](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/tidyverse.html)
-   Notes from [A Crash Course in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using R](https://bookdown.org/michael_bcalles/gis-crash-course-in-r/)
-   GEOS and S2 are engines
    -   Some arguments work with different versions

    -   Check versions

        ``` r
        sf_extSoftVersion()["GEOS"]
        #>     GEOS 
        #> "3.12.1"
        packageVersion("s2")
        #> [1] ‘1.1.7’
        ```

### Measures {#sec-geo-proc-sf-meas .unnumbered}

-   [Distances]{.underline}

    -   `st_crs(sf_obj)$units` tells what unit of measurement is that coordinate system
    -   [Planar Distances]{.underline} (Euclidean, feet or meters, projected coordinates)
        -   If your study area is small (e.g., a city block, a small park), the difference between planar and Great Circle distances will be minimal, and planar distances are usually sufficient
        -   "For a city-sized area like Chicago, which spans roughly 15 km east-west and 25 km north-south, the distortion from using planar distance with raw lat/lon coordinates would be relatively small. At Chicago's latitude (approximately 41.8°N), and over such short distances, the error compared to Great Circle distance would typically be less than 1%. errors of several kilometers for distances measured across the state."
        -   Uses Planar (projected) Coordinate Systems,
            -   *UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator*)**:** Divides the Earth into 60 zones, each 6 degrees of longitude wide. Each zone has its own origin and projection parameters designed to minimize distortion within that zone.
                -   e.g. UTM Zone 18N
            -   *State Plane Coordinate System***:** Used in the United States, each state (or sometimes a portion of a state) has its own projection and parameters optimized for that specific area
    -   [Great Circle Distances]{.underline} (latitude, longitude, degrees, geodetic coordinates)
        -   The shortest distance between two points along a great circle (a circle that divides the sphere into two equal hemispheres). It's the most accurate for Earth-based calculations.
        -   If your study area is large (e.g., a state, a country, multiple continents), the Earth's curvature becomes significant, and you *must* use Great Circle distances.
        -   Uses Geographic (angular) Coordinate Systems
            -   A latitude and longitude system in degrees, which are angles measured on the Earth's surface. They are inherently spherical (or more accurately, ellipsoidal).
            -   e.g. WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984), a widely used geographic coordinate system based on the WGS 84 ellipsoid with EPSG code 4326
    -   [Spherical Distances]{.underline} (latitude, longitude, km)
        -   Measured along a small circle parallel to the equator (constant latitude). This is simpler to calculate (euclidean vs trigonometric) than Great Circle distance, but less accurate, especially at high latitudes.
            -   Unless you're working with real-time calculations or massive datasets (millions of pairs of points), the computational savings probably wouldn't justify the trade-off in accuracy.
        -   Latitude is treated as a straight-line distance rather than accounting for the curvature of the Earth, which is why it's less accurate than Great Circle distance at high latitudes.

-   [Points in Polygons]{.underline}

    -   [`st_centroid`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_unary.html)- Finds the point in the center of a polygon

        -   This could be in a body of water (i.e. outside the polygon) for some oddly shaped boundaries such as counties with coastal inlets or bays, or gerrymandered districts, etc.

        -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}

            ``` r
            # spherical
            NY8_sf <- 
              st_read(
                system.file("shapes/NY8_bna_utm18.gpkg", 
                            package = "spData"), 
                quiet = TRUE
              )
            NY8_ct_sf <- 
              st_centroid(
                st_geometry(NY8_sf), 
                of_largest_polygon = TRUE
              )
            # planar
            st_is_longlat(NY8_ct_sf)
            #> [1] FALSE

            ny8_crs <- st_crs(NY8_sf)
            # Set the CRS of the centroid geometry
            NY8_ct_sf_sph <- 
              st_set_crs(NY8_ct_sf, 
                         ny8_crs)
            # spherical
            st_is_longlat(NY8_ct_sf)
            #> [1] TRUE
            ```

    -   [`st_point_the_surface`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_unary.html) - Guarantees that the point will fall on the surface of a member polygon. (Code is the same as `st_centroid`)

        -   The point won't necessarily be near the center.
        -   Can generate random points in a polygon for labels

    -   Generate a (potentially) more central point guaranteed to be within the polgon

        ``` r
        ny8_circs <- 
          st_inscribed_circle(st_geometry(NY8_sf), 
                              nQuadSegs = 0)

        NY8_cic_sf <- 
          st_cast(ny8_circs, 
                  to = "POINT")
        ```

        -   `st_inscribed_circle`: Calculates the largest circle that can fit entirely *within* each geometry in [NY8_sf]{.var-text}.
            -   [nQuadSegs]{.arg-text} controls the number of segments used to approximate the circle. When set to 0, it returns a 2-point LINESTRING (center point and a point on the circle). This representation is more accurate (center + radius) and efficient than using a polygon. This setting is only available for GEOS \>= "3.9.0". In general, a higher value (e.g. default = 30) results in a smoother polygon.
        -   `st_cast`: Converts the 2-point LINESTRING to just a (center) point ([to = "POINT"]{.arg-text})

        crash_buffer_icbc <- 
          st_buffer(icbc_crash_van, dist = 150)
        mapview(crash_buffer_icbc)

        # or

        ggplot() +
          geom_sf(icb_crash_van, fill = "lightblue") + 
          geom_sf(crash_buffer_icbc, fill = "red")
        ```

        -   For geodetic coordinates, [dist]{.arg-text} is specified in meters unless you have `sf_use_s2` set to [FALSE]{.arg-text}. In that case, it's in degrees.

        -   For projected coordinates, [dist]{.arg-text} is in the units of those coordinates

-   [Union]{.underline}

    ![](_resources/Geospatial,_Processing.resources/sf-union-1.jpg){.lightbox width="480"}

    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: ([source](https://bookdown.org/michael_bcalles/gis-crash-course-in-r/toolkit.html#union))\

        ``` r
        crash_buffer_union <- st_union(crash_buffer_icbc)
        mapview(crash_buffer_union)
        ```

        -   The overlapping polygons become one polygon
        -   For big data, order points in both sets by latitude and longitude before using `st_union`. This can cut down processing time substantially. ([source](https://bsky.app/profile/fbabovic.bsky.social/post/3lsyraqgwik2z))

## Aggregations {#sec-geo-proc-agg .unnumbered}

### Misc {#sec-geo-proc-agg-misc .unnumbered}

-   AKA Conservative Region Aggregation or Regridding
-   Considers the area of overlap of the source and target geometries, and uses that to weigh the source attribute values into the target value
-   Notes from [Spatial Data Science, Ch. 5](https://r-spatial.org/book/05-Attributes.html#sec-extensiveintensive)

### Methods {#sec-geo-proc-agg-meth .unnumbered}

-   Sub-Areas ($S_{ij}$) are the geometries of the original variable values (smaller than Target Areas).
-   Target Areas ($T_{ij}$) are the new larger geometries that will be the support for the aggregated variable
-   [Aggregating Extensive Variables]{.underline}
    -   Formula\
        $$
        \begin{align}
        &\hat Y_{j}(T_j)= \sum_{i=1}^p \frac{|A_{ij}|}{|S_i|} Y_i (S_i) \\
        &\text{where} \;\; A_{ij} = T_j \cap S_i
        \end{align}
        $$
    -   Process
        1.  Calculate intersection area betweem the sub-area ($S_{i}$) and the target area ($T_{j}$) .
        2.  Calculate the proportion of the intersected area ($A_{ij}$) to the sub-area ($S_{i}$)
        3.  Multiply that proportion ($|A_{ij}|\;/\;|S_i|$) times the variable ($Y_i (S_i)$) to get the target subarea variable value.
        4.  Repeat for $p$ sub-areas
        5.  Sum all target subarea variable values to get the target area variable value ($\hat Y_{j}(T_j)$)
-   [Aggregating Intensive Variables]{.underline}
    -   The assumption is that the variable has a *constant* value over each sub-area ($S_i$), and therefore has that same value for the intersection with target area ($T_j$)
    -   Formula\
        $$
        \begin{align}
        &\hat Y_{j}(T_j)= \sum_{i=1}^p \frac{|A_{ij}|}{|T_i|} Y_i (S_i) \\
        &\text{where} \;\; A_{ij} = T_j \cap S_i
        \end{align}        
        $$
        -   The difference here is the weight is the proportion of the intersection $A_{ij}$ to the target area ($T_j$)

### Examples {#sec-geo-proc-agg-exs .unnumbered}

-   [Example 1]{.ribbon-highlight}: Aggregate extensive variable into quadrants ([source](https://www.redhat.com/en/ansible-collaborative))\
    ![](_resources/Geospatial,_Processing.resources/sf-agg-nc-1.png){.lightbox width="432"}

    ``` r
    library(dplyr); library(sf)
    nc <- read_sf(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package = "sf"))

    # create quadrant indicators using two logicals
    nc$lng <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(st_geometry(nc)))[,1] > -79
    nc$lat <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(st_geometry(nc)))[,2] > 35.5

    # sum variable by quadrant indicators
    nc.grp1 <- 
      aggregate(x = nc["SID74"], 
                by = list(nc$lng, nc$lat), 
                FUN = sum) |> 
      (\(d) d[order(d$SID74), ])()
    # or
    nc.grp2 <- nc |> 
      group_by(lng, lat) |> 
      summarize(SID74 = sum(SID74)) |> 
      arrange(SID74)

    nc.grp1["SID74"] |> 
      st_transform('EPSG:32119') |>
      plot(graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE)
    ```

    -   [SID74]{.var-text} is a disease incidence (count) variable
    -   Counties are grouped by their position (according to the quadrant in which the county centroid is with respect to ellipsoidal coordinate POINT(-79, 35.5)
    -   If you look at the sf docs for the sf tidyverse functions (See Misc) under the [do_union]{.arg-text} argument, it says, "Using `st_union` resolves internal boundaries, but in case of unioning points, this will likely change the order of the points."
        -   Therefore, when you compare the output between `aggregate` and `group_by` + `summarize`, the first sets of the points in the geometry column cells will likely be different. That will be because the pairs of points in each polygon are listed in different orders and not because the resulting geometries are different.
        -   In this example, I could not see any difference in the plotted objects whether the union was done via the base R way or the dplyr way.

-   [Example 2]{.ribbon-highlight}: Aggregate Multiple Intensive Variables ([source](https://r-spatial.org/book/16-SpatialRegression.html#boston-house-value-dataset))

    ::: panel-tabset
    ## Data

    This is the Boston housing dataset. [NOX]{.var-text} is nitrous oxide pollution measurement and [NOX_ID]{.var-text} is the ID variable for the area where the measurement took place. [CHAS]{.var-text} is an indicator of whether the tract is close to the Charlestown river.\\\
    The variables are at the census tract level and the goal here is to aggregate them to the [NOX]{.var-text} measurement area using [NOX_ID]{.var-text}.

    ``` r
    pacman::p_load(
      dplyr,
      sf,
      spData
    )

    boston_506 <- 
      sf::st_read(system.file("shapes/boston_tracts.gpkg",
                              package = "spData")[1], 
                  quiet = TRUE)

    boston_506$CHAS <- as.factor(boston_506$CHAS) # just cleaning
    ```

    -   The [{sf}]{style="color: #990000"} docs say that [{dplyr}]{style="color: #990000"} needs to be loaded, but if need be, I think you could just use dplyr::function syntax and be fine.

    ## Aggregation Options

                by = ls_nox_ids,
                FUN = unique)
    boston_96$NOX <- 
      aggregate(boston_506$NOX, 
                ls_nox_ids,

    1.  Option 1: The first aggregate call is just to perform the union of the geometries . The next couple aggregate calls aggregate the variables and add them to the first one.

    2.  Option 2: Union the geometries and aggregate one of the variables at the same time. aggregate automatically creates a generic grouping variable name which can be replaced with [NOX_ID]{.var-text} by `colnames`

    3.  Option 3: Use sf's custom dplyr methods to do everyting in a few lines. You could probably get `aggregate` to handle multiple functions with a udf having conditionals, but I'm going to let that be for now.

    -   Thoughts
    :::

-   [Example 4]{.ribbon-highlight}: Large data may crash R when doing aggregations

    -   Could result in an expensive union operation over identical geometries and a R session crash

    -   Notes from [thread](https://twitter.com/kyle_e_walker/status/1559568087942172673) (Data with 100K rows crashed R.)

    -   Option 1: Set [do_union = FALSE]{.arg-text} in `summarize`

        ``` r
        tx_income_groups <- 
          get_acs(
            geography = "tract",
            table = "B19001",
            state = "TX",
            year = 2020,
            geometry = TRUE
          ) |> 
          filter(variable != "B19001_001") |> 
          mutate(bracket = case_when(
            variable > "B19001_012" ~ "Above $100k",
            TRUE ~ "Below $100k"
          )) |> 
          group_by(GEOID, bracket) |> 
          summarize(n_households = sum(estimate, na.rm = TRUE),
                    do_union = FALSE)
        ```

        -   If you just need the aggregated attribute values and not the geometry union.

    -   Option 2: Perform calculation without geometries then join

        ``` r
        tx_income_groups <- 
          get_acs(
            geography = "tract",
            table = "B19001",
            state = "TX",
            year = 2020,
            geometry = FALSE
          ) |> 
          filter(variable != "B19001_001") |> 
          mutate(bracket = case_when(
            variable > "B19001_012" ~ "Above $100k",
            TRUE ~ "Below $100k"
          )) |> 
          group_by(GEOID, bracket) |> 
          summarize(n_households = sum(estimate, na.rm = TRUE))

        tx_tracts <- 
          tracts("TX", 
                 cb = TRUE, 
                 year = 2020) |> 
          select(GEOID)
        tx_income_groups <- 
          tx_tracts |> 
          left_join(tx_income_groups, by = "GEOID")
        ```

        -   [{tidycensus}]{style="color: #990000"} has an arg to bypass d/ling the geometries, [geometry = FALSE]{.arg-text} and a separate `tracts` function to get the census tract geometries
