# Model Context Protocol (MCP) {#sec-llms-mcp .unnumbered}

-   Allows LLMS to more easily integrate with external tools
    -   It establishes a standard interface for APIs to communicate to LLMs. This way all types of APIs and their individual patterns can be integrated into an LLM app without too much hassle.
    -   Without MCP\

        -   You have build integration for each application and tool
    -   With MCP\

        -   Interactions are standardized.

    -   **MCP Client:** Various clients and apps you use, like Cursor, know how to talk using the “MCP Protocol.”
    -   **MCP Servers:** Providers like Sentry, Slack, JIRA, Gmail, etc. set up **adapters** around their APIs that follow the MCP Protocol.
        -   They convert a message like “Get me the recent messages in the #alerts channel” to a request that can be sent to the Slack API
-   Server File(s) Components
    -   Defines a set of tools for the MCP Server to implement
    -   Creates the server to listen for incoming requests
    -   Defines a \`switch\` case that receives the tool call and calls the underlying external API, like the Slack API.
    -   Wire up transport between Client and Server
        -   Allows the MCP client and server to communicate more simply than standard HTTP requests. Instead, they can read from standard IO when communicating.
