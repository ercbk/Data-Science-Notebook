    1.  Identify observations from the dataset that are relevant to our aspect.
        -   Example: Analyze consumer sentiment specifically related to the color of dresses
            -   Color is the aspect
        -   Options
            -   Filter text column to rows that only contain the aspect key word (e.g. color, colors)
                -   regex?
            -   Sometimes with more abstract aspects, such as Experience, Service, or Location, you may need to leverage topic modeling to predict which aspect is most relevant to a text.
    2.  Tokenize text into smaller pieces
        -   Some simple options would be to split text by punctuation (e.g. commas) and/or conjunctions
    3.  Calculate the Polarity (aka sentiment) relating to the aspect
        -   Apply a pre-trained sentiment classifier model
            -   Models: TextBlob
        -   Polarity range: -1 to 1
    4.  Extract the descriptors associated with our aspect
        -   Descriptors help explain the "why" behind the sentiment.
            -   e.g. the customer comment had a positive sentiment about color because they thought it was beautiful. "Beautiful" is the descriptor.
        -   Options
            -   spaCy's token classification features to automatically analyze the linguistic structure of the sentence and extract what adjectives/adverbs are associated with our noun

        -   Interpretation
            -   Customers typically respond positively to dress colors.
            -   Therefore, color is not a primary contributor to Not Recommended reviews

        -   Interpretation
            -   Customers love products with bright, vivid, and vibrant colors.
            -   Customers tend to complain about a product's color when it appears darker in person than on online pictures or is too muted or dull
            -   Company should focus on using bright, vibrant colorways and materials
