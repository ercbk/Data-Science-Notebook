-   Current Checklist
    -   Check convergence diagnostics
    -   Do posterior predictive checking
    -   Check residual plots
    -   Model comparison (if prediction)

    -   A suitably flexible Bayesian regression adjustment model,
    -   Chosen by cross-validation/LOO,
    -   Including Gaussian processes for the unit-level effects over time (and space/network if relevant),
    -   Imputation of missing data, and
    -   Informative priors for biases in the data collection process.
