-   Gaps in the time variable can be a problem if you are trying to interpolate between those gaps. (see bkmk, `method = "reml" + s(x, m = 1)`)

    -   Issues
        -   When the size of the observed time-series becomes very large.
            -   In that case, the unconditional covariance matrix will scale poorly and the model fitting step will likely become impossible.

## STL-ELM {#sec-fcast-stlelm .unnumbered}

-   Seasonal Trend Decomposition using LOESS (STL) - Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
-   Hybrid univariate forecasting model for complex series (non-stationary, non-linear)
-   The univariate series is decomposed into subseries using STL and each subseries is forecast using ELM, then those subseries forecasts are ensembled for the final forecast
    -   Each subseries is simpler and stationary

## VMD-TDNN {#sec-fcast-vmdtdnn .unnumbered}

-   Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) Based Time Delay Neural Network Model (TDNN)
-   Hybrid univariate forecasting model for complex series (non-stationary, non-linear)
-   The univariate series is decomposed into "modes" using VMD and each mode is forecast using TDNN, then those mode forecasts are recombined for the final forecast
    -   The modes are generated by Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs)
        -   Orthogonal to each other, stationary, and non-linear
    -   Think the recombination method is simply to sum the forecasts

## Taken's Embedding {#sec-fcast-tknemb .unnumbered}

-   A Dynamic Systems Model that transforms the time series into space where the dimensions are determined by multiples of lags of the time series. This transformation removes the autocorrelation between the data points and allows it to be forecasted.

    -   Kind of like a SVM

-   Misc

    -   [{nonlinearTseries}]{style="color: #990000"}

-   Parameters

    -   **d** or **τ** - Called the time delay, this will tell us how many time lags each axis of the phase space will represent

        ``` r
        # tau (time delay) estimation based on the average mutual information function
        tau.ami = timeLag(ts, technique = "ami", 
                          lag.max = 100, do.plot = T)
        ```

    -   **m** - Called the embedding dimension, this parameter will tell us the dimension of the phase space

        ``` r
        # m (embedding dimension) uses the tau estimation
        emb.dim = estimateEmbeddingDim(ts, time.lag = tau.ami,
                                      max.embedding.dim = 15)
        ```

        -   Estimated using Cao's algorithm

-   Phase Space Embedding Matrix\
    ![](./_resources/Forecasting,_Nonlinear.resources/1-gLSfAY43eOYZAATisoUOlA.png)

    -   Where f(t) is the univariate time series

-   Build the Taken's model

    ``` r
    tak = buildTakens(ts,embedding.dim = emb.dim, time.lag = tau.ami)
    ```
