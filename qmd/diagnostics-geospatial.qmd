## Symmetry {#sec-diag-geo-sym .unnumbered}

-   Most spatial statistics assume reciprocal relationships and will symmetrize weights if they are asymmetric. (e.g. Moran's I)
-   Symmetrizing weights can indeed introduce bias if the true underlying spatial process is inherently asymmetric (i.e. influence flows in one direction).
    -   [Examples]{.ribbon-highlight}:
        -   In watershed studies where upstream locations affect downstream locations but not vice versa
        -   In wind dispersal where particles move predominantly in one direction
        -   In economic studies where influence flows from larger to smaller markets but not equally in reverse
-   Statistical inference often assumes undirected (symmetric) relationships
-   Asymmetry creates a logical problem: how can A influence B but B not influence A in a spatial relationship?
-   `spdep::is.symmetric.nb` can be used to check for symmetry in weight lists (e.g. `spdep::graph2nb`)

## Disjointedness {#sec-diag-geo-disj .unnumbered}

-   These are groups of points that are connected to each other but completely separated from other groups
-   Think of islands in an archipelago:
    -   Points within each island are connected
    -   But there are no connections between islands
    -   Each island is a "component" or disjoint subgraph
-   Could indicate alternative clustering schemes in mixed effects models
-   Issues
    -   Disjoint components can break an assumption of connectivity between observations (aka spatial continuity)
    -   Block diagonal spatial weight matrices can affect computation of certain models
    -   Might need to analyze each block separately
-   `spdep::n.comp.nb` gives the number of disjoint connected subgraphs

## Spatial Autocorrelation {#sec-diag-geo-sauto .unnumbered}

-   [Misc]{.underline}

    -   Local metrics can suffer from multiple testing issues when the number of group units is large

-   [Moran's I]{.underline}

    $$
    I = \frac{N}{W} \frac{\sum_i \sum_j w_{ij}(x_i - \bar{x})(x_j - \bar{x})}{\sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
    $$

    -   A measure of global spatial autocorrelation or overall clustering of the data
        -   If there is no global autocorrelation or no clustering, there can still be clusters at a local level (See Local Moran's I)
    -   Assume homegeneity (i.e. only one statistic is needed to summarize the whole study area)
    -   $N$ is the number of spatial units (e.g. counties)
    -   $w_{ij}$ is an element of the spatial weights matrix
    -   $W$ is the sum of all $w_{ij}$
    -   Values significantly *below* the expected value are *negatively* correlated
    -   Values significantly *above* the exected value are *positively* correlated
    -   Range: $w_{\text{min}}\frac{N}{W} \lt I \lt w_{\text{max}}\frac{N}{W}$
        -   For a row normalized weight matrix, $\frac{N}{W} = 1$ (Wiki)
            -   In [{spdep}]{style="color: #990000"}, this would be [style = "W"]{.arg-text}
            -   I don't get this. W = 1, but why would N also equal 1? Not sure if this right.

-   [Local Moran's I]{.underline}\
    $$
    \begin{align}
    &I_i = \frac{x_i - \bar x}{m_2} \sum_{j=1}^N w_{ij} (x_j - \bar x) \\
    &\text{where} \;\; m_2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar x)^2}{N}
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   Moran's I is just the average of all $I_i s$, $I = \sum_{i=1}^N I_i /N$

-   [Geary's C]{.underline}\
    $$
    C = \frac{(N-1) \sum_i \sum_j w_{ij}(x_i-x_j)^2}{2W \sum_i (x_i - \bar x)^2}
    $$

    -   A measure of global spatial autocorrelation or overall clustering of the data
        -   More sensitive to local spatial autocorrelation than Moran's I so it can pick-up on spatial autocorrelation that Moran's I might have missed.
    -   $N$ is the number of analysis units on the map
    -   $w_{ij}$ is an element of the spatial weights matrix
    -   $W$ is the sum of all $w_{ij}$

-   [Local Geary's C]{.underline}\
    $$
    \begin{align}
    &C_i = \frac{1}{m_2} \sum_j w_{ij}(x_i - xj)^2\\
    &\text{where} \;\; m_2 = \frac{\sum_i (x_i - \bar x)^2}{N-1}
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   Geary's C is $C=\sum_i C_i/2W$
