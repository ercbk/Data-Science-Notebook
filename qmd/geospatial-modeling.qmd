        -   Spatial Autoregressive Combined (SAC) models combine both a Spatial Autoregression (SAR) model and a Spatial Error (SEM) model
-   Ways to Account for Spatial Autocorrelation
    -   Add spatial proxies as predictors
        -   Spatial proxies are a set of spatially indexed variables with long or infinite autocorrelation ranges that are not causally related to the response.
        -   They are “proxy” since these predictors act as surrogates for unobserved factors that can cause residual autocorrelation, such as missing predictors or an autocorrelated error term.
        -   Types
            -   Geographical or Projected Coordinates
            -   Euclidean Distance Fields (EDFs)(i.e. distance-to variables?)
-   Use Cases
    -   Interpolation - There is a geographical overlap between the sampling and prediction areas
    -   Extrapolation (aka Spatial-Model Transfer) - The model is applied to a new disjoint area
        -   The use of spatial proxies for extrapolation remains unexplored but appears to be problematic: since spatial representation is introduced via predictors and the prediction area is, by definition, different from the sampling area, feature extrapolation will occur when spatial proxies are used, which is problematic for models with poor extrapolation ability, such as RFs
    -   Predictive Inference - Knowledge discovery is the main focus
