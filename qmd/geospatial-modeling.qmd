-   CV
    -   A common case is where sample data are collected opportunistically (“whatever could be found”), and are then used in a predictive framework that does not weight them.
        -   This has a consequence that the resulting model may be biased towards over-represented areas (in predictor space and/or in spatial coordinates space), and that simple (random) cross-validation statistics may be over-optimistic when taken as performance measures for spatial prediction
        -   Adaptive cross-validation measures such as spatial cross-validation may help getting more relevant measures for predictive performance.
    -   Standard CV methods
        -   For clustered data and interpolative and predictive use cases, it generally leads to overoptimistic performance metrics when the data has significant spatial autocorrelation.
        -   For random and regular distributed data and interpolative and predictive use cases, correctly ranked the models even when the data has significant spatial autocorrelation.
    -   Spatial CV Types: Spatial Blocking, Clustering, Sampling-Intensity-Weighted CV, Model-based Geostatistical Approaches, k-fold nearest neighbour distance matching (kNNDM) CV
-   Design-based Approach: Assumes data comes from (spatially) random sampling (randomness in the sample locations), and we are interested in estimating means or totals
    -   Most standard machine learning methods, assume sample data to be independent which can be valid hen samples are collected by spatially random sampling over the spatial target area
    -   Uses when:
        -   Observations were collected using a spatial random sampling process
        -   Aggregated properties of the entire sample region (or sub-region) are needed
        -   Estimates are required that are not sensitive to model misspecification, for instance when needed for regulatory or legal purposes
-   Model-basd Approach: Assumes observations were not sampled randomly, or our interest is in predicting values at specific locations (mapping)
    -   When predictions for fixed locations are required, a model-based approach is needed and typically some form of spatial and/or temporal autocorrelation of residuals must be assumed.
    -   Use when:
        -   Predictions are required for individual locations, or for areas too small to be sampled
        -   The available data were not collected using a known random sampling scheme (i.e., the inclusion probabilities are unknown, or are zero over particular areas and or times)

    -   Add spatial proxies as predictors
    -   Models
        -   Generalized-Least-Squares-style Random Gorest (RF–GLS) - Relaxes the independence assumption of the RF model
            -   Accounts for spatial dependencies in several ways:
                -   Using a global dependency-adjusted split criterion and node representatives instead of the classification and regression tree (CART) criterion used in standard RF models
                -   Employing contrast resampling rather than the bootstrap method used in a standard RF model
                -   Applying residual kriging with covariance modeled using a Gaussian process framework
            -   From the spatial proxies paper:
                -   "Outperformed or was on a par with the best-performing standard RF model with and without proxies for all parameter combinations in both the interpolation and extrapolation areas of the simulation study."
                -   "The most relevant performance gains when comparing RF–GLS to RFs with and without proxies were observed in the 'autocorrelated error' scenario for the interpolation area with regular and random samples, where the RMSE was substantially lower."

## Spatial Proxies {#sec-geo-mod-sp}

-   Notes from [Random forests with spatial proxies for environmental modelling: opportunities and pitfalls](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/17/6007/2024/)
-   Spatial proxies are a set of spatially indexed variables with long or infinite autocorrelation ranges that are not causally related to the response.
-   They are “proxy” since these predictors act as surrogates for unobserved factors that can cause residual autocorrelation, such as missing predictors or an autocorrelated error term.
-   Types
    -   Geographical or Projected Coordinates
    -   Euclidean Distance Fields (EDFs)(i.e. distance-to variables?)
        -   Adding distance fields for each of the sampling locations (distance from one location to the other?), i.e. the number of added predictors equals the sample size.
    -   RFsp
        -   Tends to give worse results than coordinates when use of spatial proxies is inappropriate for either interpolation or extrapolation.
        -   But, together with EDFs, it is likely to yield the largest gains when the use of proxies is beneficial.
-   Factors that could affect the effectiveness of spatial proxies
    -   Model Objectives
        -   Interpolation - There is a geographical overlap between the sampling and prediction areas
            -   The addition of spatial proxies to tree models such as RFs may be beneficial in terms of enhancing predictive accuracy, and they might outperform geostatistical or hybrid methods
            -   For Random or Regular spatial distributions of locations, the model should likely benefit, especially if there's a large amount of spatial autocorrelation.
            -   For clustered spatial distributions of locations
                -   For weakly clustered data, strong spatial autocorrelation, and when there's only a subset of informative predictors or no predictors at all, then models can expect some benefit.
                    -   For other cases of weakly clustered data, there's likely no affect or a little worse performance.
                -   For strongly clustered data , it probably worsens performance.
        -   Prediction (aka Extrapolation, Spatial-Model Transferability) - The model is applied to a new disjoint area
            -   The use of spatial proxies appears to worsen performance in all cases.
        -   Inference (aka Predictive Inference) - Knowledge discovery is the main focus
            -   Inclusion of spatial proxies has been discouraged
            -   Proxies typically rank highly in variable-importance statistics
            -   High-ranking proxies could hinder the correct interpretation of importance statistics for the rest of predictors, undermining the possibility of deriving hypotheses from the model and hampering residual analysis
    -   Large Residual Autocorrelation
        -   Better performance of models with spatial proxies is expected when residual dependencies are strong.
    -   Spatial Distribution
        -   Clustered samples frequently shown as potentially problematic for models with proxy predictors
        -   Including highly autocorrelated variables, such as coordinates with clustered samples, can result in spatial overfitting

## Interaction Modeling {#sec-geo-mod-intmod .unnumbered}

-   Similar to interpolation but keeps the original spatial units as interpretive framework. Hence, the map reader can still rely on a known territorial division to develop its analyses
    -   They produce understandable maps by smoothing complex spatial patterns
    -   They enrich variables with contextual spatial information.
-   Notes from [{potential}]{style="color: #990000"} documentation
-   Packages
    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[cppSim](https://ischlo.github.io/cppSim/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} - Fast and Memory Efficient Spatial Interaction Models
    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[potential](https://riatelab.github.io/potential/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} - Spatial interaction modeling via Stewart Potentials. Also capable of interpolation
-   There are two main ways of modeling spatial interactions: the first one focuses on links between places (flows), the second one focuses on places and their influence at a distance (potentials).
-   Use Cases
    -   *Retail Market Analysis*: A national retail chain planning expansion in a metropolitan area would use potential models to identify optimal new store locations. The analysis would calculate the "retail potential" at various candidate sites
        -   Based on:
            -   Population density in surrounding neighborhoods
            -   Income levels (as a proxy for purchasing power)
            -   Distance decay function (people are less likely to travel farther to shop)
            -   Existing competitor locations
                -   Calculate distance matrix from potential site to competitor location
        -   Result:
            -   A retail chain might discover that a location with moderate nearby population but situated along major commuter routes has higher potential than a site with higher immediate population but poor accessibility. T
            -   The potential model would create a continuous surface showing retail opportunity across the entire region, with the highest values indicating prime locations for new stores
    -   *Transportation Planning*: Regional transportation authorities use potential models to optimize transit networks.
        -   They would:
            -   Map population centers (origins) and employment centers (destinations)
            -   Calculate interaction potential between all origin-destination pairs
            -   Weight these by population size and employment opportunities
            -   Apply distance decay functions reflecting willingness to commute
        -   Result:
            -   The resulting model might reveal corridors with high interaction potential but inadequate transit service. For instance, a growing suburban area might show strong potential interaction with a developing business district, but existing transit routes might follow outdated commuting patterns.
            -   The potential model helps planners identify where new bus routes, increased service frequency, or even rail lines would best serve actual travel demand.
    -   *Hospital Accessibility Study*: Public health departments use potential models to identify healthcare deserts.
        -   They would:
            -   Map existing hospital and clinic locations with their capacity (beds, specialties)
            -   Calculate accessibility potential across the region
            -   Weight by demographic factors (elderly population, income levels)
            -   Apply appropriate distance decay functions (emergency vs. specialist care have different distance tolerances)
        -   Result:
            -   The model might reveal that while a rural county appears to have adequate healthcare on paper (population-to-provider ratio), the spatial distribution creates areas with extremely low healthcare potential.
            -   This analysis could justify mobile clinics, telemedicine investments, or targeted subsidies for new healthcare facilities in specific locations to maximize population benefi

        -   Similar results as the interaction model except there are no boundaries

## Interpolation {#sec-geo-mod-interp .unnumbered}

### Misc {#sec-geo-mod-interp-misc .unnumbered}

-   The process of using points with known values to estimate values at other points. In GIS applications, spatial interpolation is typically applied to a raster with estimates made for all cells. Spatial interpolation is therefore a means of creating surface data from sample points.

        -   Stochastic modelling and ensemble learning, making it robust, scalable and suitable for large datasets.
        -   Provides a powerful framework for uncertainty quantification, offering both point estimates and empirical posterior distributions.
        -   It is implemented in Python 3.x, with a C++ core for improved performance.
-   In **Spatial Filtering** or **Smoothing**, the unobserved values ($S(s)$) are simulated and a white noise component ($\epsilon$) (possibly reflecting measuerment error) is included such that\
    $$
    Z(s) = S(s) + \epsilon
    $$
    -   In Kriging, $Z(s)$ is estimated through a model
-   Measurements can have strong regional variance, so the geographical distribution of measurements can have a strong influence on statistical estimates.
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Temperature\
        -   Two different geographical distributions of sensors\
            ![](_resources/Geospatial,_General.resources/geospatial-distribution-1.svg){.lightbox width="432"}
            -   A concentration of sensors in North can lead to a cooler average regional temperature and vice versa for the South.
        -   Distribution of temperatures across the region for 1 day.\
            ![](_resources/Geospatial,_General.resources/geospatial-distribution-2.png){.lightbox width="532"}
            -   With this much variance in temperature, a density of sensors in one area can distort the overall average.

### Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW)

-   A weighted average, using weights inverse proportional to distances from the interpolation location\
    $$
    \begin{align}
    &\hat z(s_0) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m w_i z(s_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i} \\
    &\text{where} \;\; w_i = |s_o - s_i|^{-p}
    \end{align}
    $$

    -   $p$ : The inverse distance power which is typically 2 or optimized via CV

    ``` r
    grid_de <- 
      st_bbox(shp_de) |>
      st_as_stars(dx = 10000) |>
      st_crop(shp_de)

    idw_no2 <- 
      idw(NO2 ~ 1, 
          sf_no2, 
          grid_de)

    ggplot() + 
      # interpolation fill
      geom_stars(
        data = idw_no2,
        aes(x = x, 
            y = y, 
            fill = var1.pred)
      ) + 
      # shapefile as a string
      geom_sf(data = st_cast(shp_de, "MULTILINESTRING")) +
      # locations
      geom_sf(data = sf_no2) +  
      xlab(NULL) + 
      ylab(NULL)
    ```

    -   IDW requires a grid. [dx]{.arg-text} says the cells of the grid have 10000m (10km) width which results in 10km x 10km cells.
        -   The grid isn't very fine and is visible if you zoom-in.
    -   [NO2 \~ 1]{.arg-text} specifies an intercept-only (unknown, constant mean) model for (aka simple kriging model)
    -   The polygons as strings looks janky (esp zoomed in), but this code this way doesn't work otherwise. I'm sure there has to be a way to do this with polygons though.
    -   The ordering of the layers is important. The interpolation fill must be first.

-   [Description]{.underline}
    -   Gaussian Process prediction for values at unobserved locations
    -   Considers not only the distances but also the other variables that have a linear relationship with the estimation variables
    -   Uses a correlated Gaussian process to guess at values between data points\

        -   Uncorrelated - white noise
        -   Correlated - smooth
            -   The closer in distance two points are to each other, the more likely they are to have a similar value (i.e. geospatially correlated)
            -   Example: Temperature
    -   Fewer known points means greater uncertainty\

-   [Variograms]{.underline}
    -   Describes the degree of spatial dependence ($\gamma$) in a random field or stochastic process ( $Z(s)$ )

        -   e.g. A measure of how much two samples taken from the mining area will vary in gold percentage depending on the distance between those samples. Samples taken far apart will *vary* more than samples taken close to each other.

    -   Empirical (or Sample or Experimental) Variogram

        $$
        \begin{align}
        &\hat \gamma(h_i) = \frac{1}{2N(h_i)} \sum_{j=1}^{N(h_i)} (z(s_j) - z(s_j + h'))^2 \\
        &\text{where} \;\; h_i = [h_{i, 0}, h_{i, 1}] \; \text{and} \; h_{i, 0} \le h' \lt h_{i, 1}
        \end{align}
        $$

        -   $\gamma$ : Spatial dependence between a particular pairwise distance
        -   $h$ : Geographical (pairwise) distance between two locations
        -   $N(h_i)$ : The number of pairs of locations for that particular distance
        -   $z$ : Value of the variable you're interested in at a particular location. (e.g. Temperature)
        -   $s_j$ : Location

    -   The empirical variogram cannot be computed at *every* distance, $h$, and due to variation in the estimation, it is not ensured that it is a *valid* (?) variogram which is needed for interpolation models. To ensure a valid variogram, models are used to estimate it.

            -   $p$: Partial Sill
            -   $h$: Pairwise Distance Between Locations
            -   $n$: Nugget
            -   $r$: Range - The distance in which the difference of the variogram from the sill becomes negligible
                -   In models with a fixed sill, it is the distance at which this is first reached
                -   In models with an asymptotic sill, it is conventionally taken to be the distance when the semivariance first reaches 95% of the sill.

    -   Process: Optimize the parameters of the parameters of theoretical variogram to fit to the experimental one. Then predict values using the estimated theoretical variogram.

    -   cutoff: Maximum distance (Default is one-third of the length of the bounding box diagonal)

    -   width: Constant interval width (Default is the cutoff divided by 15).
