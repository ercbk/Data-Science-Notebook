            -   Accounts for spatial dependencies in several ways:
                -   Using a global dependency-adjusted split criterion and node representatives instead of the classification and regression tree (CART) criterion used in standard RF models
                -   Employing contrast resampling rather than the bootstrap method used in a standard RF model
                -   Applying residual kriging with covariance modeled using a Gaussian process framework
            -   From the spatial proxies paper:
                -   "Outperformed or was on a par with the best-performing standard RF model with and without proxies for all parameter combinations in both the interpolation and extrapolation areas of the simulation study."
                -   "The most relevant performance gains when comparing RF–GLS to RFs with and without proxies were observed in the 'autocorrelated error' scenario for the interpolation area with regular and random samples, where the RMSE was substantially lower."

## Spatial Proxies {#sec-geo-mod-sp}

-   Spatial proxies are a set of spatially indexed variables with long or infinite autocorrelation ranges that are not causally related to the response.
-   They are “proxy” since these predictors act as surrogates for unobserved factors that can cause residual autocorrelation, such as missing predictors or an autocorrelated error term.
-   Types
    -   Geographical or Projected Coordinates
    -   Euclidean Distance Fields (EDFs)(i.e. distance-to variables?)
        -   Adding distance fields for each of the sampling locations (distance from one location to the other?), i.e. the number of added predictors equals the sample size.
    -   RFsp
        -   Tends to give worse results than coordinates when use of spatial proxies is inappropriate for either interpolation or extrapolation.
        -   But, together with EDFs, it is likely to yield the largest gains when the use of proxies is beneficial.
-   Factors that could affect the effectiveness of spatial proxies
    -   Model Objectives
        -   Interpolation - There is a geographical overlap between the sampling and prediction areas
            -   The addition of spatial proxies to tree models such as RFs may be beneficial in terms of enhancing predictive accuracy, and they might outperform geostatistical or hybrid methods
            -   For Random or Regular spatial distributions of locations, the model should likely benefit, especially if there's a large amount of spatial autocorrelation.
            -   For clustered spatial distributions of locations
                -   For weakly clustered data, strong spatial autocorrelation, and when there's only a subset of informative predictors or no predictors at all, then models can expect some benefit.
                    -   For other cases of weakly clustered data, there's likely no affect or a little worse performance.
                -   For strongly clustered data , it probably worsens performance.
        -   Prediction (aka Extrapolation, Spatial-Model Transferability) - The model is applied to a new disjoint area
            -   The use of spatial proxies appears to worsen performance in all cases.
        -   Inference (aka Predictive Inference) - Knowledge discovery is the main focus
            -   Inclusion of spatial proxies has been discouraged
            -   Proxies typically rank highly in variable-importance statistics
            -   High-ranking proxies could hinder the correct interpretation of importance statistics for the rest of predictors, undermining the possibility of deriving hypotheses from the model and hampering residual analysis
    -   Large Residual Autocorrelation
        -   Better performance of models with spatial proxies is expected when residual dependencies are strong.
    -   Spatial Distribution
        -   Clustered samples frequently shown as potentially problematic for models with proxy predictors
        -   Including highly autocorrelated variables, such as coordinates with clustered samples, can result in spatial overfitting

## Potential Modeling {#sec-geo-gen-potmod .unnumbered}

-   Similar to interpolation but keeps the original spatial units as interpretive framework. Hence, the map reader can still rely on a known territorial division to develop its analyses
    -   They produce understandable maps by smoothing complex spatial patterns
    -   They enrich variables with contextual spatial information.
-   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[potential](https://riatelab.github.io/potential/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"}: Spatial interaction modeling via Stewart Potentials. Also capable of interpolation
-   There are two main ways of modeling spatial interactions: the first one focuses on links between places (flows), the second one focuses on places and their influence at a distance (potentials).
-   Use Cases
    -   *Retail Market Analysis*: A national retail chain planning expansion in a metropolitan area would use potential models to identify optimal new store locations. The analysis would calculate the "retail potential" at various candidate sites
        -   Based on:
            -   Population density in surrounding neighborhoods
            -   Income levels (as a proxy for purchasing power)
            -   Distance decay function (people are less likely to travel farther to shop)
            -   Existing competitor locations
                -   Calculate distance matrix from potential site to competitor location
        -   Result:
            -   A retail chain might discover that a location with moderate nearby population but situated along major commuter routes has higher potential than a site with higher immediate population but poor accessibility. T
            -   The potential model would create a continuous surface showing retail opportunity across the entire region, with the highest values indicating prime locations for new stores
    -   *Transportation Planning*: Regional transportation authorities use potential models to optimize transit networks.
        -   They would:
            -   Map population centers (origins) and employment centers (destinations)
            -   Calculate interaction potential between all origin-destination pairs
            -   Weight these by population size and employment opportunities
            -   Apply distance decay functions reflecting willingness to commute
        -   Result:
            -   The resulting model might reveal corridors with high interaction potential but inadequate transit service. For instance, a growing suburban area might show strong potential interaction with a developing business district, but existing transit routes might follow outdated commuting patterns.
            -   The potential model helps planners identify where new bus routes, increased service frequency, or even rail lines would best serve actual travel demand.
    -   *Hospital Accessibility Study*: Public health departments use potential models to identify healthcare deserts.
        -   They would:
            -   Map existing hospital and clinic locations with their capacity (beds, specialties)
            -   Calculate accessibility potential across the region
            -   Weight by demographic factors (elderly population, income levels)
            -   Apply appropriate distance decay functions (emergency vs. specialist care have different distance tolerances)
        -   Result:
            -   The model might reveal that while a rural county appears to have adequate healthcare on paper (population-to-provider ratio), the spatial distribution creates areas with extremely low healthcare potential.
            -   This analysis could justify mobile clinics, telemedicine investments, or targeted subsidies for new healthcare facilities in specific locations to maximize population benefi

    -   Potential GDP per Capita (interaction)\
        ![](./_resources/Geospatial,_General.resources/image.1.png){.lightbox group="intercomp" width="414"}
        -   Stewart Potentials have smoothed the values
        -   Municipality boundaries still intact, so you could perform an analysis based on these GDP regions
    -   Smoothed GDP per Capita (interpolation)\
        ![](./_resources/Geospatial,_General.resources/image.2.png){.lightbox group="intercomp" width="414"}
        -   Similar results as the interaction model except there are no boundaries

### Misc {#sec-geo-gen-interp-misc .unnumbered}

        -   Ssupports optimal estimation using both precise (hard) and uncertain (soft) data, such as intervals or probability distributions
-   Measurements can have strong regional variance, so the geographical distribution of measurements can have a strong influence on statistical estimates.
    -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Temperature\
        -   Two different geographical distributions of sensors\
            ![](_resources/Geospatial,_General.resources/geospatial-distribution-1.svg){.lightbox width="432"}
            -   A concentration of sensors in North can lead to a cooler average regional temperature and vice versa for the South.
        -   Distribution of temperatures across the region for 1 day.\
            ![](_resources/Geospatial,_General.resources/geospatial-distribution-2.png){.lightbox width="532"}
            -   With this much variance in temperature, a density of sensors in one area can distort the overall average.
        -   Interpolation *evens* *out* the geographical distribution of measurments\
