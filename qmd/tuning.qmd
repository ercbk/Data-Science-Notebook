-   Tree Parameter *Categories* (many overlap)
    -   Tree Structure and Learning
    -   Training Speed
    -   Accuracy
    -   Overfitting
-   When the search space is quite large, try the particle swarm method or genetic algorithm for optimization.
-   Early Stopping can lower computational costs and decrease practitioner downtime

## Pairwise Tuning {#sec-tuning-pairwise .unnumbered}

-   Tunes a pair of parameters at a time. Once the first pair of parameters is tuned, those values replace the default parameter values, and the next pair of parameters is tuned, etc.
-   Limits the computational cost of performing a full grid search jointly with all parameters at once supposedly without sacrificing much in terms of predictive performance.
    -   A full grid search or other tuning method can be applied to each pair.
-   Might be beneficial to create pairs that affect the same tuning area of the model fit (e.g. subsampling, regularization, tree complexity) so that the tuning process might capture any interaction effects between the parameters.

    -   Each pair of parameters along with the loss metric are plotted in a 3D chart
    -   `matplotlib::plot_trisurf()` uses [Surface Triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_triangulation) is used to interpolate the gaps between the tested parameter values
    -   If the chart has multiple pronounced dips and bumps (left chart):
        -   May indicate that there's a minima in one of the dips that might be better than the chosen parameter values as the interpolation process might have smoothed over that area a bit.
            -   Might want to play with the smoothing parameter a bit to try and get a clearer idea of the range of values to further investigate.
        -   Indicates the model is sensitive to this pair of parameters which might translate into a model instability, when we pass a new type of dataset into the tuned model in the deployment domain.

## Bayesian Optimization {#sec-tuning-bayesopt .unnumbered}

-   tl;dr
    -   Builds a surrogate model using Gaussian Processes that estimates model score
    -   This surrogate is then provided with configurations picked randomly, and the one that gives the best score is kept for training
    -   Each new training updates the posterior knowledge of the surrogate model.
-   Components:
    -   The black box function to optimize: f(x).
        -   We want to find the value of x which globally optimizes f(x) (aka objective function, the target function, or the loss function)
    -   The acquisition function: a(x)
        -   Used to generate new values of x for evaluation with f(x).
        -   a(x) internally relies on a Gaussian process model m(X, y) to generate new values of x.
-   Steps:
    1.  Define the black box function f(x), the acquisition function a(x) and the search space of the parameter x.
    2.  Generate some initial values of x randomly, and measure the corresponding outputs from f(x).
    3.  Fit a Gaussian process model m(X, y) onto X = x and y = f(x) (i.e. surrogate model for f(x))
    4.  The acquisition function a(x) then uses m(X, y) to generate new values of x as follows:
        -   Use m(X, y) to predict how f(x) varies with x.
        -   The value of x which leads to the largest predicted value in m(X, y) is then suggested as the next sample of x to evaluate with f(x).
    5.  Repeat the optimization process in steps 3 and 4 until we finally get a value of x that leads to the global optimum of f(x).
        -   All historical values of x and f(x) should be used to train the Gaussian process model m(X, y) in the next iteration --- as the number of data points increases, m(X, y) becomes better at predicting the optimum of f(x).

## Tree-based Parzen Estimators (TPE) {#sec-tuning-tpe .unnumbered}

-   Misc
    -   Notes from [HyperOpt Demystified](https://towardsdatascience.com/hyperopt-demystified-3e14006eb6fa)
    -   Libraries
        -   [{{]{style="color: goldenrod"}[hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/){style="color: goldenrod"}[}}]{style="color: goldenrod"}
    -   Typically outperforms basic bayesian optimization, but the main selling point is it handles complex hyperparameter relationships via a tree structure.
    -   Supports categorical variables (cat hyperparams?) which traditional Bayesian optimization does not.
-   Process
    -   Train a model with several sets of randomly-selected hyperparameters, returning objective function values.
    -   Split our observed objective function values into "good" and "bad" groups, according to some threshold gamma (γ).
    -   Calculate the "promisingness" score, which is just *P(x\|good) / P(x\|bad)*.
    -   Determine the hyperparameters that maximize promisingness via mixture models.
    -   Fit our model using the hyperparameters from step 4.
    -   Repeat steps 2--5 until a stopping criteria.
-   Tips/Tricks
    -   HyperOpt is parallelizable via both [Apache Spark](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/automl-hyperparam-tuning/hyperopt-concepts.html#:~:text=A%20Trials%20or%20SparkTrials%20object,Horovod%20in%20the%20objective%20function.) and [MongoDB](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/scaleout/mongodb/). If you're working with multiple cores, wether it be in the cloud or on your local machine, this can dramatically reduce runtime.
    -   If you're parallelizing the tuning process via Apache Spark, use a `SparkTrials`object for single node ML models (sklearn) and a `Trails` object for parallelized ML models (MLlib).
    -   MLflow easily integrates with HyperOpt.
    -   Don't narrow down the search space too early. Some combinations of hyperparameters may be surprisingly effective.
    -   Defining the search space can be tricky, especially if you don't know the [functional form of your hyperparameters](https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/getting-started/search_spaces/). However, from personal experience TPE is pretty robust to misspecification of those functional forms.
    -   Choosing a good objective function goes a long way. In most cases, error is not created equal. If a certain type of error is more problematic, make sure to build that logic into to your function.

        -   too low may lead to overfit
        -   too high may lead to underfit
    -   **Maximum Features**: randomly choosing a set of features for each split
        -   Useful for high dimension datasets; adds some randomness

            -   Tree splits are chosen in the usual way, but the model at each leaf is linear instead of constant
                -   The first tree has constant leaf values
            -   Helps to extrapolate linear trends in forecasting

            -   \* must set bagging_freq to an integer \*
        -   **feature_fraction**: specifies the percentage of features to sample from when training each tree
            -   Default: 1

        -   Use feature sub-sampling by set **feature_fraction**
        -   Use bigger training data
        -   Try **lambda_l1**, **lambda_l2** and **min_gain_to_split** for regularization
        -   Try **max_depth** to avoid growing deep tree
        -   Try **extra_trees**
        -   Try increasing **path_smooth**

## XGBoost {#sec-tuning-xgb .unnumbered}

-   Notes
    -   Drob starts with **learning_rate** = 0.01 and tune other parameters before coming back to tune learning rate
    -   Dancho tunes **learning_rate** first which he says is responsible for about 80% of the model's performance. Then, he fixes the tuned learning rate and tunes the rest of the grid of hyperparameters.
        -   Cuts training time by 10x
    -   Kuhn suggests setting trees to about 500 and tune stop_iter
        -   **stop_iter**: early stopping; stops if no improvement has been made after this many iterations
    -   [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/tuning-model-performance/) found that the most important hyperparameters were:
        -   **tree_depth**, **trees**, **learning_rate**, and **min_n**
    -   **tree_method** (more [details](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754) about exact, approx)- specify which tree construction algorithm you want to use. Trade-offs between accuracy and speed
        -   "exact" - accurate algorithm, but it is not very scalable as during each split find procedure it iterates over all entries of input data.
            -   Inefficient when the data does not completely fit into memory
            -   Doesn't support distributed training
        -   "approx" - uses quantile sketch and gradient histograms
        -   "hist" - method used in lightgbm with slight changes (binning continuous features)
            -   Applies some of approx performance enhancements (e.g. bin caching)
            -   Typically faster than approx
        -   "gpu_hist" - gpu implementation of "hist"
            -   Much faster than "hist" and usually requires less memory
                -   Guessing because it uses the gpu memory
            -   Not available for some OSs ([link](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#python))

        -   Grid Value Examples: c(3,5,7), c(5, 7, 9)
        -   More Predictors --\> higher mtry
    -   Shrinkage

            -   Range: \[0,1\]
            -   Grid value examples: 0.2, 0.01, 0.008, 0.005
            -   More trees $\rightarrow$ lower learning rate
    -   Tree-Booster Constraints
        -   **tree_depth** (aka **max_depth**): The complexity of each tree
            -   Grid value examples: 4 - 8 (also see lightgbm recommendations for max_depth)
            -   Increasing makes the model more likely to overfit
            -   Consumes memory when training a deep tree.

                -   L2 regularization term on weights
                -   Simplifies the model
                -   Has largest effect when data is smaller

    -   Random Subsampling
        -   **subsample**:
            -   Setting it to 0.5 means that XGBoost would randomly sample half of the training data prior to growing trees. and this will prevent overfitting.
            -   Subsampling will occur once in every boosting iteration
            -   Default: 1
            -   Range: (0,1\]

            -   (bottom pipe) Ridge regression feeds its predictions to the random forest which feeds it's predictions to the lasso regression (ensemble model)
            -   Red arrows indicate how far the data/predictions have travelled through the structure. Here it's all the way to the ensemble model
            -   Red circle indictates which model is currently being tuned
            -   Models without hyperparameter values are models with default values for their hyperparameters
        -   Figure shows that the KNN and the RR (bottom pipe) models have already been tuned and the RR model (top pipe) is the model being tuned.
        -   The red Y' indicates that the prediction scoring, while ridge regression is being tuned, is happening at the ensemble model.
        -   RF gets tuned next then finally the ensemble model
-   Simultaneous Tuning
    -   All models, including the ensemble model, are tuned at the same time
    -   Computationally expensive
        -   I'd think it would be more monetarily expensive as well given that you likely have to provision more machines in any realistic scenario to get a decent training time (one for each pipe?)

## DL {#sec-tuning-dl .unnumbered}

-   Increasing or decreasing the number of training iterations
-   Weight Decay\
    ![](./_resources/Tuning.resources/image.6.png){.lightbox width="632"}
    -   Improves data efficiency by \> 50%
    -   Frequently found in the best hyperparam configs
    -   Among the most important hparams to tune
    -   Tricky to tune
-   Learning Rate Scheduling ([article](https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-rate-schedules-and-adaptive-learning-rate-methods-for-deep-learning-2c8f433990d1)): The schedule reduces the learning rate as training progresses, so take smaller step sizes near and around the optimum
