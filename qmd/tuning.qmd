## Pairwise Tuning {#sec-tuning-pairwise .unnumbered}

-   Tunes a pair of parameters at a time. Once the first pair of parameters is tuned, those values replace the default parameter values, and the next pair of parameters is tuned, etc.
-   Limits the computational cost of performing a full grid search jointly with all parameters at once supposedly without sacrificing much in terms of predictive performance.
    -   A full grid search or other tuning method can be applied to each pair.
-   Might be beneficial to create pairs that affect the same tuning area of the model fit (e.g. subsampling, regularization, tree complexity) so that the tuning process might capture any interaction effects between the parameters.

    -   Each pair of parameters along with the loss metric are plotted in a 3D chart
    -   `matplotlib::plot_trisurf()` uses [Surface Triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_triangulation) is used to interpolate the gaps between the tested parameter values
    -   If the chart has multiple pronounced dips and bumps (left chart):
        -   May indicate that there's a minima in one of the dips that might be better than the chosen parameter values as the interpolation process might have smoothed over that area a bit.
            -   Might want to play with the smoothing parameter a bit to try and get a clearer idea of the range of values to further investigate.
        -   Indicates the model is sensitive to this pair of parameters which might translate into a model instability, when we pass a new type of dataset into the tuned model in the deployment domain.

        -   Parallelized by using a Dask distributed cluster
        -   Solve Combined Algorithm/Classifier Selection and Hyperparameter optimization (CASH) problem using multiple GP surrogates.
        -   GP surrogates shown to outperform tree-structured Parze estimators (TPE), and TPE is designed to be sequential in nature, thus suffers performance loss in parallel search.
-   tl;dr
    -   Builds a surrogate model using Gaussian Processes that estimates model score
    -   This surrogate is then provided with configurations picked randomly, and the one that gives the best score is kept for training
    -   Each new training updates the posterior knowledge of the surrogate model.
-   Components:
    -   The black box function to optimize: f(x).
        -   We want to find the value of x which globally optimizes f(x) (aka objective function, the target function, or the loss function)
    -   The acquisition function: a(x)
        -   Used to generate new values of x for evaluation with f(x).
        -   a(x) internally relies on a Gaussian process model m(X, y) to generate new values of x.
-   Steps:
    1.  Define the black box function f(x), the acquisition function a(x) and the search space of the parameter x.
    2.  Generate some initial values of x randomly, and measure the corresponding outputs from f(x).
    3.  Fit a Gaussian process model m(X, y) onto X = x and y = f(x) (i.e. surrogate model for f(x))
    4.  The acquisition function a(x) then uses m(X, y) to generate new values of x as follows:
        -   Use m(X, y) to predict how f(x) varies with x.
        -   The value of x which leads to the largest predicted value in m(X, y) is then suggested as the next sample of x to evaluate with f(x).
    5.  Repeat the optimization process in steps 3 and 4 until we finally get a value of x that leads to the global optimum of f(x).
        -   All historical values of x and f(x) should be used to train the Gaussian process model m(X, y) in the next iteration --- as the number of data points increases, m(X, y) becomes better at predicting the optimum of f(x).

## Tree-based Parzen Estimators (TPE) {#sec-tuning-tpe .unnumbered}

-   Misc
    -   Notes from [HyperOpt Demystified](https://towardsdatascience.com/hyperopt-demystified-3e14006eb6fa)
    -   Libraries
        -   [{{]{style="color: goldenrod"}[hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/){style="color: goldenrod"}[}}]{style="color: goldenrod"}
    -   Typically outperforms basic bayesian optimization, but the main selling point is it handles complex hyperparameter relationships via a tree structure.
    -   Supports categorical variables (cat hyperparams?) which traditional Bayesian optimization does not.
-   Process
    -   Train a model with several sets of randomly-selected hyperparameters, returning objective function values.
    -   Split our observed objective function values into "good" and "bad" groups, according to some threshold gamma (γ).
    -   Calculate the "promisingness" score, which is just *P(x\|good) / P(x\|bad)*.
    -   Determine the hyperparameters that maximize promisingness via mixture models.
    -   Fit our model using the hyperparameters from step 4.
    -   Repeat steps 2--5 until a stopping criteria.
-   Tips/Tricks
    -   HyperOpt is parallelizable via both [Apache Spark](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/automl-hyperparam-tuning/hyperopt-concepts.html#:~:text=A%20Trials%20or%20SparkTrials%20object,Horovod%20in%20the%20objective%20function.) and [MongoDB](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/scaleout/mongodb/). If you're working with multiple cores, wether it be in the cloud or on your local machine, this can dramatically reduce runtime.
    -   If you're parallelizing the tuning process via Apache Spark, use a `SparkTrials`object for single node ML models (sklearn) and a `Trails` object for parallelized ML models (MLlib).
    -   MLflow easily integrates with HyperOpt.
    -   Don't narrow down the search space too early. Some combinations of hyperparameters may be surprisingly effective.
    -   Defining the search space can be tricky, especially if you don't know the [functional form of your hyperparameters](https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/getting-started/search_spaces/). However, from personal experience TPE is pretty robust to misspecification of those functional forms.
    -   Choosing a good objective function goes a long way. In most cases, error is not created equal. If a certain type of error is more problematic, make sure to build that logic into to your function.

## Decision Trees {#sec-tuning-dectr .unnumbered}

-   Misc
    -   Also see Algorithms, [ML \>\> Trees \>\> Decision Trees](algorithms-ml.qmd#sec-alg-ml-trees){style="color: green"}
        -   Reducing continuous features using PCA can improve predictive performance
-   Hyperparameters
    -   **Maximum Depth (aka Tree Depth)**: Maximum level a tree can "descend" during the training process
        -   Too high may lead to overfit
        -   Too low may lead to underfit
    -   **Minimum Samples Split (aka Min N, minsplit)**: The minimum number of observations that must exist in a node in order for a split to be attempted
        -   Too low may lead to overfit
        -   Too high may lead to underfit
        -   Defaults
            -   {rpart}: 20
        -   Recommended Range
            -   {2^1^ = 2, . . . , 2^7^} ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05847))
    -   **Minimum Samples Leaf (minbucket)**: Number of observations in a terminal node after the split has "potentially" happened
        -   Too low may lead to overfit
        -   Too high may lead to underfit
        -   Defaults
            -   {rpart}: minsplit/3
        -   Recommended Range
            -   {2^0^ = 1, . . . , 2^6^} ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05847))
    -   **Minimum Impurity Decrease**: Sets the threshold for the amount of impurity decrease that must occur in order for there to be another split
        -   Too low may lead to overfit
        -   Too high may lead to underfit
    -   **Maximum Features**: Randomly choosing a set of features for each split
        -   Useful for high dimension datasets; adds some randomness
        -   Too high can lead to long training times
        -   Too low may lead to underfit
    -   **Complexity Parameter (cp)**: The threshold complexity parameter for {rpart}. The main role of this parameter is to save computing time by pruning off splits that are obviously not worthwhile\
        $$
        R_{cp}(T) = R(T) + \text{cp} \cdot |T| \cdot R_1(T)
        $$
        -   $R$ is the risk (?)
        -   $T_1$ is the tree with no splits
        -   $|T|$ is the number of splits
        -   [cp = 1]{.arg-text} will always result in a tree with no splits
        -   For regression models, the scaled cp has a very direct interpretation: if any split does not increase the overall R^2^ of the model by at least cp then that split is decreed to be, a priori, not worth pursuing.
        -   Default: 0.01
        -   Recommended Range

-   Hyperparameters
    -   **num_trees**: Total number of trees
        -   This should not be tuned as more trees almost always leads to better performance, but instead should be set the maximum that is computationally practical with your resources and your time constraint ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03491) which references this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05654))
        -   Default: 500 (Ranger) with 2000 potentially a maximum (?)
    -   **mtry**: The number of potential features that can get split at each node
        -   Most influential hyperparameter for random forests.

            -   Tree splits are chosen in the usual way, but the model at each leaf is linear instead of constant
                -   The first tree has constant leaf values
            -   Helps to extrapolate linear trends in forecasting
            -   Categorical features are used for splits as normal but are not used in the linear models

            -   Default: 1
            -   \* must set bagging_freq to an integer \*
        -   **feature_fraction**: specifies the percentage of features to sample from when training each tree
            -   Default: 1

## XGBoost {#sec-tuning-xgb .unnumbered}

-   Notes
    -   Drob starts with **learning_rate** = 0.01 and tune other parameters before coming back to tune learning rate
    -   Dancho tunes **learning_rate** first which he says is responsible for about 80% of the model's performance. Then, he fixes the tuned learning rate and tunes the rest of the grid of hyperparameters.
        -   Cuts training time by 10x
    -   Kuhn suggests setting trees to about 500 and tune stop_iter
        -   **stop_iter**: early stopping; stops if no improvement has been made after this many iterations
    -   [Uber](https://eng.uber.com/tuning-model-performance/) found that the most important hyperparameters were:
        -   **tree_depth**, **trees**, **learning_rate**, and **min_n**

        -   "exact" - accurate algorithm, but it is not very scalable as during each split find procedure it iterates over all entries of input data.
            -   Inefficient when the data does not completely fit into memory
            -   Doesn't support distributed training
        -   "approx" - uses quantile sketch and gradient histograms
        -   "hist" - method used in lightgbm with slight changes (binning continuous features)
            -   Applies some of approx performance enhancements (e.g. bin caching)
            -   Typically faster than approx
        -   "gpu_hist" - gpu implementation of "hist"
            -   Much faster than "hist" and usually requires less memory
                -   Guessing because it uses the gpu memory
            -   Not available for some OSs ([link](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#python))

        -   **learning_rate (aka eta)** aka step size; [explainer](https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-rate-hyperparameter-explained-2c1a619cbd33)
            -   Shrinks the feature weights to make the boosting process more conservative
            -   More trees $\rightarrow$ lower learning rate

                -   Details on performance, durations, etc. between sequential and simultaneous tuning methods
                -   Links to repo, experimental paper
            -   tldr;
                -   They like the simultaneous tuning because had the best metric performance with the lowest variance (more stable results)
                -   I think the sequential tuning method was comparable (and better in some cases) to the simultaneous tuning method but is probably faster and less costly.

            -   On the right side, some kind of feature engineering process or modeling happens prior to the predictive model/ensemble model.
-   Sequential Tuning
    -   Only one model is tuned at a time
    -   The scoring, during the tuning process, happens on the ensemble model

            -   (bottom pipe) Ridge regression feeds its predictions to the random forest which feeds it's predictions to the lasso regression (ensemble model)
            -   Red arrows indicate how far the data/predictions have travelled through the structure. Here it's all the way to the ensemble model
            -   Red circle indictates which model is currently being tuned
            -   Models without hyperparameter values are models with default values for their hyperparameters
        -   Figure shows that the KNN and the RR (bottom pipe) models have already been tuned and the RR model (top pipe) is the model being tuned.
        -   The red Y' indicates that the prediction scoring, while ridge regression is being tuned, is happening at the ensemble model.
        -   RF gets tuned next then finally the ensemble model
-   Simultaneous Tuning
    -   All models, including the ensemble model, are tuned at the same time
    -   Computationally expensive
        -   I'd think it would be more monetarily expensive as well given that you likely have to provision more machines in any realistic scenario to get a decent training time (one for each pipe?)
