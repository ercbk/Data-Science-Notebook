    -   Sometimes severance is associated with the noncompete to ensure that enough time has passed before laid-off employees start a new job, so as to make any information they have obsolete.
    -   If you don't have a noncompete, apply for jobs at your former company's competitor. If you do have a noncompete, flag some companies' career pages for later.
