    -   shinyapps.io, heroku, Fly.io
    -   Fly.io's free tier is your best option if you want the apps running 24/7 and under a secured custom domain (none of this is offered for Shinyapp.io and Heroku).

        -   Costs
            -   Higher implementation cost
            -   No product support, therefore there is no possibility of SLA guarantees
