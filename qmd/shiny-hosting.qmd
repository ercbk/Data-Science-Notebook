        -   PaaS means platform-as-a-service, i.e. it is a fully managed system without you having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. This also means less control over the infrastructure, i.e. when it comes to choosing the data region where your app is served from.

    -   shinyapps.io, heroku, Fly.io
    -   Fly.io's free tier is your best option if you want the apps running 24/7 and under a secured custom domain (none of this is offered for Shinyapp.io and Heroku).
