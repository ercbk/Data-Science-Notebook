-   Detach a package

    ``` r
    detach("package:vegan", unload = TRUE)
    ```

-   Import functions from package

    ``` r
    # R 4.5.0
    use("dplyr", c("filter", "select"))
    ```

    -   I think this functionality is also available in R4.0+ with `library(pkg, include.only = c("fun1", "fun2")`

-   Make sure namespace/environment is empty ([Thread](https://hachyderm.io/@djnavarro/115269271212827407))

    ``` r
    stopifnot(length(ls()) == 0L)
    ```

    -   Useful to include at the top of a script for people who might run your R script without first restarting their R session
        -   If they load stuff in their .RProfile, this will still fail,. So not a great solution
    -   Running scripts using `Rscript` works, but that's in CLI
    -   `ls` returns a vector of character strings giving the names of the objects in the specified environment.
    -   Perhaps
        -   `if (interactive()) {message("make sure you've restarted your session before running this script")}`
        -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[conflicted](https://conflicted.r-lib.org/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} and maybe use `conflict_scout`

-   R-devel (\>= 4.4.0) gained a command-line option to adjust the connections limit (previous limit was 128 parallel workers)

    ``` bash
    $ R
    > parallelly::availableConnections()
    [1] 128

    $ R --max-connections=512
    > parallelly::availableConnections()
    [1] 512
    ```

-   Get installed package names, versions, environment, source ([article](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2024/06/few-notes-on-getting-r-package-data-from-the-local-library/))

    ``` r
    > package_names <- installed.packages()[, 1]
    > package_data <- lapply(
    +     package_names,
    +     utils::packageDescription,

-   Java Dependent Packages

    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[rJavaEnv](https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} - Aims to assist users of all [{rJava}]{style="color: #990000"}-dependent packages by providing functions to quickly install the required Java version and set environment variables.
        -   It downloads non-installer archives of Java, extracts them to a cache folder, and links them in the current project or working directory. This way, rJavaEnv does not contaminate the user’s machine with unnecessary installations and configurations.

        -   When downloading a Java version, it tells you where it's stored.

            ```         
            Java 21 (amazon-corretto-21-x64-windows-jdk.zip) for windows x64 installed at
                C:\Users\ercbk\AppData\Local/R/cache/R/rJavaEnv/installed/windows/x64/21 and symlinked to
                C:/Users/ercbk/Documents/rjavaenv/windows/x64/21
            ```

        -   Code for the path to the installation is then added to your .Rprofile.

        -   "if you are on a Linux system that did not have any 'Java' version previoulsy installed and you are not using pre-build 'R' package binaries (for example from 'Posit Package Manager') and instead install all 'R' packages from source, after this step you may have to quit R, follow these steps: <https://solutions.posit.co/envs-pkgs/using-rjava/#reconfigure-r> to set configure 'Java' for 'R', and only then install 'rJava', as otherwise 'rJava' cannot be built from source."

## Update R {#sec-misc-updater .unnumbered}

-   Misc
    -   <https://www.r-project.org/>

    -   RStudio [NEW.md](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/blob/main/NEWS.md)

    -   [{]{style="color: #990000"}[rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig){style="color: #990000"}[}]{style="color: #990000"} - r version management system

    -   `update.packages(checkBuilt = TRUE, ask = FALSE)` is supposed to search for packages in other R versions and update them in the new R version, but I haven't tried it, yet.

    -   Install the newest stable version to check it out

        ``` bash
        rig add next
        R-next
        ```

        -   `R-<ver>` runs a R version without it being the default

    -   Errors when compiling from source may require installing libraries and they'll supply code to install via "pacman"

        -   Open Start \>\> scroll down to RTools40 \>\> RTools Bash
        -   Paste pacman code and hit enter to install

    -   Problem packages in the past

        -   [{brms}]{style="color: #990000"} dependency, [{igraph}]{style="color: #990000"}, didn't have a binary on CRAN and wouldn't compile from source even with correct libraries installed.
            -   Sol'n: `install.packages("igraph", repos = 'https://igraph.r-universe.dev')`
                -   installs dev version from r-universe
        -   Some [{easystats}]{style="color: #990000"} packages had gave [{pak}]{style="color: #990000"} some problems. No difficulties using `install.packages` with default repo or if they had a r-universe repo though.
-   Steps
    1.  Copy user installed packages in current R version

        -   In R:

            ``` r
            squirrel <- names(installed.packages(priority = "NA")[, 1]) # user installed packages
            readr::write_rds(squirrel, "packages.rds")
            ```

            -   Then, close RStudio

    2.  Check/Update rig version

        -   In powershell: `rig --version`
        -   Check current rig release: [link](https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases)
        -   Download and install if your version isn't current
            -   Windows:
                -   `winget install posit.rig`
                -   [Executable](https://github.com/r-lib/rig/releases) (See Assets section)

    3.  Install new version of R

        -   Close R if not already closed
        -   `rig add release` installs the latest version of R.
        -   `rig default <new_r_version>` sets that version as the default
            -   e.g. `rig default 4.4.2`

    4.  RTools: Check to see if you have the latest because you'll need it to compile some of newest versions of packages.

        -   Your rtools folder has the version in it's folder name.
        -   rtools [website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) has the latest version and an .exe to download
        -   `rig add rtools43` will install the RTools for R 4.3 or you can specify any version
        -   `rig add rtools` will install all RTools versions for all R versions that are installed.

    5.  Add R and RTools to path

        -   Right-click Windows \>\> System \>\> (right panel) Advanced System Settings \>\> Environment Variables \>\> Under User Variables, highlight Path, click Edit \>\> Click Add
            -   R: Add path to directory with all the RScript, R exe, etc. e.g. "C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.2.3\\bin\\x64"
            -   RTools: e.g. "C:\\rtools43\\usr\\bin"

    6.  Open R and confirm new version

        -   If RStudio
            -   The setting of the new version to the "default" version of R in rig should result in RStudio loading the new version if you have automatic detection enabled.
            -   If not, Tools \>\> Global Options \>\> General
                -   Under "R version", click "change" button; choose new R version
                -   Quit session and restart RStudio

    7.  Install "high maintenance" packages

        -   I've had issues with {pak} installing packages that need to be compiled. Maybe be worth trying {pak} first to see if they've fixed it.

        -   [{cmdstanr}]{style="color: #990000"} doesn't live on CRAN, so you have to use: `install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))`

            -   Check for latest cmdstan version
                -   After loading the package, `library(cmdstanr)` , it should run a check on your cmdstan version and tell you if there's a newer version.
                -   To update, first check toolchain: `check_cmdstan_toolchain()`
                    -   Might tell you to update RTools or that you need some C++ library added
                -   Fix C++ toolchain with `check_cmdstan_toolchain(fix = TRUE)`
                -   Update cmdstan: `install_cmdstan()`
                -   May need to install {rstudioapi} and run `rstudioapi::restartSession()` (programmatically) or just `ctrl + shift + f10` so that this package can be used as a dependency for other packages that need to be installed.

        -   [{rstanarm}]{style="color: #990000"}: `install.packages("rstanarm")`

        -   [{polars}]{style="color: #990000"}, [{tidypolars}]{style="color: #990000"}

            ``` r
            Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = "true")
            install.packages("polars", repos = "https://community.r-multiverse.org")
            install.packages("tidypolars", repos = c("https://community.r-multiverse.org", 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
            ```

    8.  Install other packages

        ``` r
        moose <- readRDS("packages.rds")
        moose <- moose[!moose %in% c("cmdstanr", "rstanarm", "ebtools", "translations", "<RStudio add-ins>", "<other pkgs not on CRAN>")]

        err_pkgs <- list()

        for (i in seq_along(moose)) {
          print(moose[i])
          tryCatch(
            expr = pak::pkg_install(moose[i], ask = FALSE),
            error = function(e) {
              err_pkgs[[i]] <<- moose[i]
            }
          )
        }

        # remove null (or empty) elements of the list
        leftover_pkgs <- 
              err_pkgs[!sapply(err_pkgs, \(x) is.null(x) || length(x) == 0)]
        leftover_pkgs

        fs::file_delete("packages.rds")
        ```

        -   [{ebtools}]{style="color: #990000"} is my personal helper package.

        -   [{translations}]{style="color: #990000"} is a system package that shouldn't have been included when I saved the packages from previous version, but was when I recently updated. Might not be necessary to include it in the excuded packages in the future.

    9.  Check for updates of RStudio ([link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/))

        -   Current version under Help \>\> About Rstudio
        -   Possible to check for updates under Help \>\> Check for Updates, but that's failed me before.

## Update Python {#sec-misc-updatepy .unnumbered}

### Linux {#sec-misc-updatepy-lin .unnumbered}

-   Misc

    -   Each Ubuntu (and probably other distros) version has a python version already installed. To install a newer but not-the-latest stable version, you have to use the PPA: deadsnakes.
        -   **Don't set the newer version as default**. Just include the version in the command, e.g. `python3.12`

            -   The pre-installed version of Python has important modules installed that doesn't come with the deadsnakes versions.
            -   Even if you do this at the regular user level and not at root, it can still affect scripts (e.g. on PATH) that expect the system-level python version and its modules.

        -   Or set the new python version as an alias in your bashrc.

            ``` bash
            # add to ~/.bashrc
            alias python='python3.12' alias python3='python3.12'
            ```
    -   Always a good idea to hang back from the latest version of Python, because of bugs but also because packages like TensorFlow and PyTorch don't usually support the latest stable version for awhile.

        ```

        -   I added the deadsnakes PPA (Personal Package Archive) repository to apt and during the add, it got the error, `ssl.SSLEOFError: EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:2426)`
        -   I thought updating and upgrading might help, but I got this error.
        -   Claude said the key wasn't imported correctly. The "old way" worked, but it did give me this warning, `apt-key is deprecated. Manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8)).`
            -   I think this refers to the "modern way" which I also included.

-   Updating Python

    ``` bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade

    # Install software-properties-common if not already installed
    sudo apt install software-properties-common

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

    # check that the new repository was added
    ls -l /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3.12 -y
    ```

    -   [software-properties-common]{.arg-text} is a package that has help functions like `add-apt-repository`, ppa stuff, gpa key stuff, etc. (It was already came installed with Ubuntu)
    -   The PPA deadsnakes is a repo that has older-than-the-latest python versions for Ubuntu versions.
    -   The [-y]{.arg-text} flag just says the answer is "Yes" to any prompts

-   Additional Modules

    -   The PPA deadsnakes' versions seem to be pretty barebones, but the repo also makes available several modules

    -   Absolutely want venv and Claude suggested a few other system-level packages

        ``` bash
        # Install additional packages you'll likely need
        sudo apt install python3.12-venv python3.12-dev python3.12-full
        ```

        -   dev - Contains Python header files needed to compile C extension
        -   full - Seems like stuff related to some IDE. Might be one you can skip
