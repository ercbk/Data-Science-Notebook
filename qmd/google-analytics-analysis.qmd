    -   The *quick view* event of "Cap Black" has been fired 1045 times but only 121 of those unique events
    -   A view filtered by [Event Category]{.var-text}, [Event Action]{.var-text}, and [Event Label]{.var-text} has the same values for [Unique Events]{.var-text}, [Sessions]{.var-text}, and [Unique Dimension]{.var-text} combinations\*

    -   Variables or Top: The view is filter by [Page]{.var-text} and [Category]{.var-text}, [Action]{.var-text}, and [Label]{.var-text}
        -   [Unique Events]{.var-text} and [Unique Dimension Combinations]{.var-text} match
    -   Right or Bottom: The view is filter by [Page]{.var-text} and only [Category]{.var-text} and [Action]{.var-text}
        -   [Unique Events]{.var-text} and [Unique Dimension Combinations]{.var-text} do NOT match
    -   Interpretation
        -   Left or Top (index = page, event label)
            -   Total [Unique Events]{.var-text} answers, "How many total unique quickviews (event) were there per label per page?"
                -   Labels can be repeatedly counted, just not on the same page
            -   Total [Unique Dimension Combinations]{.var-text} answers, ditto
        -   Right or Bottom (index = page)
            -   Total [Unique Events]{.var-text} still answers the same question as above as if event label were included in the view
            -   Total [Unique Dimension Combinations]{.var-text} answers, "How many total unique pages was a quickview (event) used?"

-   [Example 4]{.ribbon-highlight}

    -   Same basic scenario as Example 3 (right or bottom pic) except it's for 2 people
        -   Same calculations for [Unique Events]{.var-text} and [Unique Dimension Combinations]{.var-text} but those calculations for each user/session are summed together

    -   Question: "How many people interact with products in general by device?"
    -   Answer: 2480 ([Unique Dimension Combinations]{.var-text})
        -   [Total Events]{.var-text}: how many interactions overall per device?
        -   [Unique Events]{.var-text}: how many unique product and unique user interaction combinations are there per device?
        -   [Unique Dimension Combinations]{.var-text}: How many unique users are interacting with a product (i.e. products in general) per device?

-   [Example 6]{.ribbon-highlight}

    -   Interaction Rate, Avg. Clicks
    -   Find the interaction rate and average clicks for the "Add to Cart" button on the Sock product page
    -   Interaction Rate
        -   Steps
            -   Create a custom report with [Page]{.var-text}, [Event Category]{.var-text}, [Event Action]{.var-text}, [Event Label]{.var-text}

                -   For [Page = "Sock"]{.arg-text} there are 100 sessions (i.e. the number of people who saw the "Add to Cart" button)
                    -   This wasn't covered in detail, but in the examples, session always equaled [unique dimensian combinations]{.var-text}. So. I'm guessing this number and the one below aren't on the same lines of the report.
                -   For [Page = "Sock"]{.arg-text} and [Event Action = "Add to Cart Click"]{.arg-text} there are 80 [Unique Dimension Combinations]{.var-text}.

            -   Calculate Interaction Rate,

                $$
                \text{IR} = \frac{80 \times 100}{100} = 80\%
                $$
    -   Average Click Rate
        -   Calculate Average Click Rate,

            $$
            \text{avg\_cr} = \frac{\text{total events}}{\text{unique dimension combinations}}
            $$

    -   Funnel Test
    -   Optimize a contact form on your website
    -   Left Panel \>\> Explore \>\> Funnel Exploration
    -   Hypothesized Funnel
        1.  People enter your website through page X.
            -   You suspect that after reading this page, they want to contact you so they visit the contact page
        2.  People visit the contact page
        3.  Complete contact form
            -   You've implemented an event in Google Analytics that measure the form completion
    -   Compare segments in the Hypothesized Funnel where users did complete form and didn't complete the form
        -   The differences should show how you can optimize so that more people complete a form.

-   [Example 8]{.ribbon-highlight}

    -   How is product quality affecting user retention?
    -   Left Panel \>\> Explore \>\> Cohort Exploration
        -   Define a cohort that includes users who experienced an error and subsequently uninstalled your app.
    -   Steps:
        -   For Cohort inclusion, under Others, choose a custom error event you've defined.
        -   For Return criteria, under Others, choose the [app_remove]{.var-text} event.

-   [Example 9]{.ribbon-highlight}

    -   \<Metric\> has moved in the negative direction, find the root cause
    -   Examples
        -   Creation of facebook user groups is down 20%. What will you do?
        -   Avg ETA is up by 3 minutes. How do you investigate the problem?
    -   Solution framework
        1.  Clarify question/metrics
            -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Avg ETA is up by 3 min
                -   How is the start time and end time defined?
                    -   Is the start time at the time of initial request by the customer or when the customer enters the vehicle
        2.  Examine the time aspect of the problem
            -   Did the metric change suddenly or progressively?
            -   Internal issue? - e.g. bad data source, problem with data collection, bug in a processing script
            -   External issue? - e.g. seasonality, competitor new product or feature, industry trend, special event, natural disaster
        3.  Have other related features/products in the company experienced the same change?
            -   Was there a recent change in the feature or product line?
        4.  Segment by [demographic]{.var-text}, [region]{.var-text}, [device]{.var-text}, [platform]{.var-text}, [language]{.var-text}, etc.
        5.  Decompose the metric and repeat steps 1-4 on each submetric
            -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}:

                $$
                \begin{aligned}
                \mbox{daily active users (DAU)} = \;\; &\mbox{existing users} + \mbox{resurrected users} \\ 
                                                  &+ \mbox{new users} - \mbox{churned users}
                \end{aligned}
                $$
        6.  Summarize approach
            -   List most probable causes and recommended solutions

-   [Example 10]{.ribbon-highlight}

    -   How do you measure the success or health of \<product/feature\>?
    -   Examples
        -   How would measure the health of "Mentions" (Facebook celebrity app)? How can Facebook determine if it's worth keeping it?
        -   Instagram is launching a new feature (links to products). How do you tell if it's doing well?
        -   A job site wants to know how to measure the success of the job recommendations.
    -   Solution framework
        1.  Clarify the function or goal of the feature/product
            -   \*\* Always do this one \*\*
            -   What does it do? How is it used? Who is it for?
        2.  Define metrics (no more than 3)
            -   Recommended: 2 success, 1 guardrail (metric that shouldn't degrade when a new feature is added)
            -   Success Examples: daily active users, number of bookings, conversion rate, click-through-rate of recommendation results, percentage of users who ended up applying for a clicked-on job recommendation (sounds like a type of conversion rate)
            -   Guardrail Examples: cancellation rate, bounce rate

-   [Example 11]{.ribbon-highlight}

    -   How many users have installed your app?

        ``` sql

    -   Questions
        -   *How many users* do it?
            -   You can see whether or not enough users are engaging with the page or a feature and if there's a potential for improvement
                -   i.e. If almost all users are doing it, then there won't be much room for improvement.
            -   You'll also need a decent sample size if you're measuring correlation. Since this is ecommerce, I doubt this will be a problem.
        -   How *their conversion* looks like vs the users who don't do what you want them to do
            -   So you can hypothesize whether or not engaging more users with this part of a journey can have a positive impact on the business, or on conversion in this case.

        -   "Users who do X tend to have a \# times higher conversion rate compared to users who don't do X. That said, there's only Y percent of users who do X. We can either analyze the behavior of those users and try to attract more similar users to use our product, or funnel more users to do X."
    -   Process:
        -   Filter conversion metrics (See Example 22) by page or feature
        -   Examine conversion range between those that visit the page/use the feature and those that don't
            -   [Example]{.ribbon-highlight}: Over this period\

                -   Between 3.97 -- 5.73% of users visit the "Store search results" page (a proxy for search), but
                    -   Their user conversion rate is 0.9 - 7.3%
                -   Users who don't visit that page have a user conversion rate between 0.5% - 2.4%
                -   Me: I think with this webpage/feature it would be safe to ignore the time aspect and perform difference-in-means test or a cohen's d standardized test to see if and how much these conversion rates differ.
                    -   Although, viewing as line chart can indicate when various periods of seasonality for product are.
        -   When you find a sizable difference between these groups. Ask:
            -   What else makes those users different?
            -   What else they do on the app?
            -   Where they come from?
            -   How can you help them connect with the product they may be interested in?
                -   Beware: making the page visitation/feature usage *mandatory* (e.g. a user must visit the login page before purchasing) usually will **decrease** conversion
    -   Can also look at webpages/features that adversely affect conversion. (e.g. "Page Unavailable")
        -   Might be useful to see how these events affect CLV, retention, etc.

    -   Power User Analysis
        -   \% Users vs Views
            -   Shows what percent of users view a page/feature vs number of views for a given time period
    -   From [Looking for Power User Journeys](https://towardsdatascience.com/looking-for-power-user-journeys-in-e-commerce-746f5f68b697)
    -   Also see [Product Development \>\> Metrics \>\> Growth Metrics \>\> Power User Analysis](https://ercbk.github.io/Domain-Knowledge-Notebook/qmd/product-development-general.html#sec-proddev-gen-metrics-growth-pua){style="color: green"}
    -   You either want the mode of these charts to shift to the right or you want a smile pattern with modes on the far left and far right
        -   Users in the far right mode are considered "power users."
    -   Identify features correlated with conversion (example 23) and moniter these features' power user curves to measure progress in producing more power users and therefore more conversions
        -   Can also be broken down be cohorts (see [Algorithms, Product](Algorithms,%20Product) \>\> Cohort Analysis)
    -   Product Details Pages (PDP)\
        ![](./_resources/Google,_Analytics,_Analysis.resources/image.4.png){.lightbox width="682"}
        -   Around 50% of users in January 2021 viewed 2 PDPs
        -   See Example 21 \>\> CTE \>\> unnested_events_categorized for SQL code to create a PDP category. (It collapses various product detail webpages into a PDP category)
        -   An online business wants mode of this chart to move to the right (i.e. funnel users to PDP pages), since view of PDPs are positively correlated with conversion

    -   Diagnosing path lengths in user journeys
        -   Long user journeys may be because of active browsing or it may be a sign of a user getting lost
    -   From [Looking for Power User Journeys](https://towardsdatascience.com/looking-for-power-user-journeys-in-e-commerce-746f5f68b697)
    -   When a user first visits a webpage, which is necessary for conversion (e.g. Product Listing Page), towards the end of a long journey, then something has likely gone wrong.
        -   i.e. They're likely have trouble finding the PLP.
    -   See Example 21 \>\> Final Query for code that ranks each webpage in the user journey according to when it's first visited. (most of the cleaning code in the CTE will also likely be required.)
    -   PLP: % session vs first seen rank during a session\
        ![](./_resources/Google,_Analytics,_Analysis.resources/image.5.png){.lightbox width="682"}
        -   Y axis: % of sessions
        -   X axis: [page_rank_session_first_seen]{.var-text}
            -   Potential ranks for a webpage during a session
            -   Low Ranks = The webpage is first viewed towards the beginning of the session
            -   High Ranks = The webpage is first viewed towards the end of the session
        -   \*\* Note that the ranks on the x-axis are ordered according to their y-axis values (highest to lowest) \*\*
            -   So don't interpret the chart as a distribution
        -   Interpretation: A large proportion of user sessions are viewing the PLP *very* early in the user journey, they're likely landing on this page from paid search (e.g. Google)
            -   i.e. The ranks with the highest % session values are low ranks (Top 5 ranks are 1,3,4,5,6)
    -   Store Search Page: % session vs first seen rank during a session\
        ![](./_resources/Google,_Analytics,_Analysis.resources/image.6.png){.lightbox width="682"}
        -   Same axis descriptions as in PLP example
        -   Interpretation: The search page is visited mostly as the 3rd, 4th, or 5th page visited, so it's early enought that users are likely not having a tough time finding it and may and prefer to engage with it rather than browse the navigation bar.
    -   Checkout page: % session vs first seen rank during a session\
        ![](./_resources/Google,_Analytics,_Analysis.resources/image.7.png){.lightbox width="682"}
        -   Same axis descriptions as in PLP example
        -   Interpretation: There is large range (10 to 43) of relatively equally likely path lengths before conversion

    -   Segment User Purchases as New Customers or Returning Customers

    -   Customers are users that have purchased (i.e. converted)

    -   [Data](https://developers.google.com/analytics/bigquery/web-ecommerce-demo-dataset) is Google Merchandise Store

    -   Build a base table with orders by customer and date\
        ![](./_resources/Google,_Analytics,_Analysis.resources/image.8.png){.lightbox width="432"}

        ``` sql
        WITH base_table AS (
        -- orders by customer and date   
            SELECT
              user_pseudo_id AS user_id,
              ecommerce.transaction_id AS order_id,
              PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', event_date) AS order_date
            FROM
              `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`
            WHERE
              event_name = 'purchase'
              AND ecommerce.transaction_id <> '(not set)'
            GROUP BY
              1,
              2,
              3
        )
        ```

        -   Data is filtered to only include rows representing purchases with a valid transaction id.
            -   Google Analytics will store a default "(not set)" value if the data isn't accessible, isn't being tracked properly, or for other reasons.
        -   Results are then grouped across all three dimensions so that each row represents a unique order per client per date

    -   Label customers as 'new' or 'returning'\
        ![](./_resources/Google,_Analytics,_Analysis.resources/image.9.png){.lightbox width="532"}

        ``` sql
        SELECT
          *,
          CASE
            WHEN DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY order_date) = 1 
            THEN 'new' ELSE 'returning'
        END
          AS customer_type
        FROM
          `datastic.new_existing.base_table`
        ```

        -   `DENSE_RANK()` allows us to assign the same rank to multiple orders made on the same day.
        -   On September 12, 2020, the customer 13285520 makes the first order and was given the label 'new'.
        -   Then, on December 12, 2020, this same customer makes a second order, which resulted in having a 'returning' type.
